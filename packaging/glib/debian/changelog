      - 01_gettext-desktopfiles.patch: Merge OpenSUSE's and our patch:
        - Now prefers inline translations over gettext translations, which
          fixes a few corner cases (like renaming .desktop files on the
          user's desktop), is more in line with the recent gconf patch,
          and more palatable for upstream inclusion.
        - Use X-GNOME-Gettext-Domain, for preparing upstream inclusion.
        - Forwarded upstream now.
      - Add 02_gettext-desktopfiles-ubuntu.patch: Provide backwards
        compatibility for 01_gettext-desktopfiles.patch for
        X-{Debian,Ubuntu}-Gettext-Domain. The latter was changed to use
        X-GNOME-, so this is necessary until all our .desktop files are
        converted.
