Description: GNU Radio Software Radio Toolkit
 GNU Radio provides signal processing blocks to implement software
 radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF
 hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a
 simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic
 and commercial environments to support both wireless communications
 research and real-world radio systems.
 .
 GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python
 programming language, while the supplied performance-critical signal
 processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point
 extensions, where available. Thus, the developer is able to implement
 real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use,
 rapid-application-development environment.
 .
 While not primarily a simulation tool, GNU Radio does support
 development of signal processing algorithms using pre-recorded or
 generated data, avoiding the need for actual RF hardware.
 .
 This package contains the gnuradio-companion, a graphical tool for
 creating signal flow graphs and generating flow-graph source code.
 Also included are a variety of tools and utility programs.
