foomatic-filters (4.0.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - foomaticrip.h: Raised PATH_MAX to 65536 bytes so that CUPS
       filter calls with many command line options work (LP: #1019662).
     - options.c, renderer.c: Fixed problems discovered by a Coverity scan
       (Upstream bug #752).

foomatic-filters (4.0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - Fixed off-by-one bug which has cut off the last character of the
       option string for CUPS (5th command line argument) and so made the
       last option setting not being applied. LP: #1003194.
     - Fixed wrong access to command line option list which prevented the
       command line options being passed on to the pdftops CUPS filter
       when incoming PDF is converted to PostScript. LP: #1002699.

foomatic-filters (4.0.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - Improved check whether a driver works with PDF input data:
       Do not take into account bogus options which appear due to bugs in
       PPD files (type is TYPE_NONE) or composite options and in addition
       add debug output to show the reason for the decision to convert to
       PostScript (LP: #953962).

 -- Didier Raboud <odyx@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Mar 2012 11:32:54 +0200

foomatic-filters (4.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - If the input data is PDF but the driver requires PostScript, use the
       pdftops CUPS filter when CUPS is the spooler. This way we always use
       the same method to convert PDF to PostScript in the whole system,
       including any workarounds applied in the CUPS filter.

  [ Didier Raboud ]
  * Bump debhelper compat to 9 for auto-buildflags.

foomatic-filters (4.0.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - Do not use a string buffer limited to 512 characters for the options
       string supplied by CUPS through the fifth command line argument. Some
       PPD files can produce much longer option strings.

  [ Slavko ]
  * Add Slovak po-debconf translation. (Closes: #647119)

foomatic-filters (4.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - If incoming PDF needs to be converted to PostScript
       due to the filter command line not being a standard Ghostscript
       command line, no separate PDF command line being supplied, or
       options in the PPD being implemented by PostScript code, use
       preferrably Ghostscript (with the "ps2write" device) for this
       conversion as Ghostscript is better optimized for printing and
       has a more sophisticated color management compared to Poppler.
     - SECURITY FIX: Use the mktemp shell command/mkstemp() function to create
       the debug log file and the renderer input data file (both files only
       generated when foomatic-rip is un in debug mode) with file names with an
       unpredictable part. The names are /tmp/foomatic-rip-XXXXXX.log and
       /tmp/foomatic-rip-YYYYYY.ps where the XXXXXX and YYYYYY are replaced by
       random strings. Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat for for the patch
       (Upstream bug #936, CVE-2011-2924).

foomatic-filters (4.0.8-0ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - Added support for the color management daemon colord and the CUPS PPD
       extensions for ICC profiles.
     - Added "-dNOINTERPOLATE" to all Ghostscript command lines defined in
       foomatic-rip to make page rendering significantly faster.
     - Use "ps2write" output device instead of the deprecated "pswrite"
       when generating PostScript with Ghostscript.
     - SECURITY FIX: It was possible to make CUPS executing
       arbitrary commands as the system user "lp" when foomatic-rip was
       used as CUPS filter. Fixed by not parsing named options (like
       "--ppd lj.ppd") when foomatic-rip is running as CUPS filter, as
       CUPS does not supply named options to their filters.
     - SECURITY FIX: Use mkstemp() instead of mktemp() for creating temporary
       files.
     - Corrected typos in the man page.

    Removed patches with upstream fixes.
  * debian/control: Added build dependency on libcups2-dev, as now cups-config
    is used by the ./configure script to find CUPS-related directories.

  * debian/patches/23_prioritize-ppd-options-over-cups-options-on-command-line-fix-custom-options.patch:
    If there are printing system options (like "media" of CUPS) and PPD
    options (like "PageSize") on the command line and they do the same thing 
    (like choosing the paper size) let the setting of the PPD option always
    have priority, as this is expected for a CUPS filter (see CUPS STR #3148).
    This is done by treating the printing system options before the PPD 
    options (LP: #338999).
    Custom page sizes were not accepted if one of the three parameters
    "WidthOffset", "HeightOffset", or "Orientation" of the "PageSize" option
    in the PPD file did not allow 0 as value.
    Made error messages for the parameters of custom options more readable.

     - Made merging of PJL options of the PPD and of the driver correctly
       working.
     - Corrected the insertion of the "%%PageSetup" sections. 
     - Inserted PostScript option settings from pstops were not corrected
       with custom option settings done on the command line (numerical,
       string, password).
     - If there was only one PJL option in the PPD no PJL got added at all
       (LP: #303691).
     - Made foomatic-rip conforming with the LSB compliance tests (LSB bug
       #2423).

  * New upstream release (BZR rev 158)
     - Conversion of PDF to PostScript in the case that the driver does not
       support PDF input did not work due to a bug in handling the
       subprocesses (Upstream bug #153).
     - foomatic-rip inserted the -sOutputFile GhostScript command line 
       argument at the wrong position when printing a PDF file (not from
       stdin), which made Ghostscript crashing.
     - Option settings can be given in the PPD file before the option is
       "declared", which led foomatic-rip to think that there are 
       PostScript options (the default) in the PPD and the driver could not
       understand PDF input. Now, foomatic-rip checks for PostScript
       options after the whole PPD has been read (Upstream bug #154).

foomatic-filters (3.0.2-20071204-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - foomatic-gswrapper.in: Let Ghostscript always use buffered
      input. This works around a Ghostscript bug which prevents
      printing encrypted PDF files with Adobe Reader 8.1.1 and
      Ghostscript built as shared library (Ghostscript bug #689577,
      Ubuntu bug LP: #172264)
    - Allow the parameters of the "*Foomatic..."
      lines which formerly had to be given without quotes also to be
      given with double quotes. This is to support generation and
      manipulation of Foomatic PPDs with the CUPS DDK. The PPD
      generator of the CUPS DDK ("ppdc") can create these lines only
      with quoted parameters (See http://www.cups.org/str.php?L2551).
    - Bug fixes:
       o If the CUPS-style duples option
         "-o sides={one|two}-sided[-{long|short}-edge]" was supplied,
         the "Duplex" option could be set to "0", "LongEdge", or
         "ShortEdge", which do not exist in the "Duplex" options in
         PPD files (Thanks to Ricoh Japan for reporting this bug). 
       o Now all of "LongEdge", "DuplexNoTumble", or "ShortEdge", 
         "DuplexTumble", are converted to each other if supplied as 
         value to an enumerated choice option (usually "Duplex") and
         this value is not in the list of choices.
       o Reset the best score for finding the narrowest page range
         before treating each option, not only before the first
         option. Now jobs with page overrides on more than one
         option are executed correctly.
       o If an option had the default value "0" (enumerated choice,
         numerical, string) in the PPD file, the first choice from
         the list was set as default and not "0".
       o When assigning a non-integer number to an integer option,
         the "%%BeginFeature: ..." line of the option inserted into 
         the PostScript data stream still contained the non-integer
         value. Only the value in the code piece was converted to
         integer.
       o If a non-integer "*FoomaticRIPDefault..." was given for an
         integer option it was not converted to integer. 
       o Boolean options had "0" and "1" as values in the
         "%%BeginFeature: ..." lines and not "False" and "True".
       o PPD-supplied JCL/PJL options did not get merged with
         driver-generated JCL/PJL options when there were spaces
         between the JCL command and the "=" (ex: "@PJL SET TRAY = 1").
       o Now all of "0", "No", "Off", "False" or "1", "Yes", "On",
         "True" are converted to each other if supplied as value to
         an enumerated choice option and this value is not in the
         list of choices.

foomatic-filters (3.0.2-20070312-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release
    o Replaced sysread() and syswrite() by read() and print() in foomatic-rip
      as the buffering of sysread() and syswrite() is not compatible with the
      buffering of the read() and print() used in the other operations. This
      lead to printouts being messed up (closes LP#87597).
