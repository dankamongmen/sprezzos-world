  * debian/patches/unity_support_test.patch:
    - force llvmpipe in the unity profile if we are in the grey zone, meaning:
      the card and drivers have opengl support, however, it doesn't met unity
      requirements (opengl < 1.4, no vertex shaders support…). Thanks duflu
      (LP: #1039155)
      Note that we already discourage them to upgrade from precise to quantal
      with a warning before the upgrade, however let's get a slow ui rather
      than none on the iso as well.

    - opacify plugin: opacity isn't reset after switching window (LP: #1050757)
    - cmake fails on python 2.6 as sys.version_info does not contain 
      major_version or minor_version (LP: #1048964)
    - scale mode is not visible if a fullscreen window is unredirected 
      (LP: #1047168)

      (like a menu) opens above them (LP: #1046664)
    - Week33 - Grid highlight window appears while switching between workspaces
      (LP: #1037142)
    - gtk-window-decorator leaks large numbers of pixmaps and pixmap memory

  [ Sam Spilsbury ]
  * debian/python-compizconfig.install
    - Install compizconfig-python.pc
  * debian/patches/100_expo_layout.patch
    - re-add the expo layout that used to be in precise (LP: #1047067)
    - add some testcases

  [ Timo Jyrinki ]
  * New upstream snapshot.
    - Fix multiple window placement bugs (LP: #974242) (LP: #976032)
    - Don't waste CPU looping through and looking at all the windows if you're
      rendering an output that has no damage on it. (LP: #1014986)
    - Updated convert files to fix some typos in the key names. (LP: #1041631)
    - Fix crash when imgsvg is loaded, due to missing symbol
      (decor_apply_gravity from libdecoration). (LP: #956986)
    - Treat unresolved symbols at link time as an error, rather than letting
      them through and cause strange crashes later. (LP: #1043143)
    - Refactors a little bit of the upgrade code and gets it under test to
      prepare to fix (LP: #1042537)
    - Updated AUTHORS from the full bzr log, and re-sort the list.
      (LP: #1042095)
    - Fixes FTBFS for kde4-window-decorator (LP: #1041310)
    - Fix obvious omissions from the introduction of unminimize_*,
      which were causing the unminimize animation settings to be ignored
      (LP: #1040455)
    - resize plugin: don't crash if resize wasn't initiated externally
      (LP: #1045191)
    - Clean up capitalization (LP: #1045652)
    - Avoid division by zero, if plugins try to deform a window down to size
      zero. (LP: #1045235)
    - Make "Unredirect Fullscreen Windows" more reliable. This fixes the
      problem with unredirection failing to engage at all (LP: #1041066) when
      gtk-window-decorator creates offscreen windows that are stacked on top.
      This also fixes the problem with unredirect hiding all windows,
      because it thinks the desktop window should be stacked on top
      (LP: #980663).
    - Ensure unredirected windows don't stay unredirected if they're no longer
      on top. (LP: #1041047)
    - Fix launching terminal functionality and make show-hud default key 
      visible. Update the defaults to org.compiz.integrated to reflect the
      actual gnome values pre-gnome-3. (LP: #1040081) (LP: #1046199) 
      (LP: #1046190)
    - Fix show-hud, bump COMPIZ_GNOME_INTEGRATED_SETTINGS_LIST_SIZE.
      (LP: #1046212)
    - Fixed: Windows with an alpha-channel, like gnome-terminal, were not
      being considered as possibly covering fullscreen windows. But they most
      certainly can. This ensures such RGBA windows are visible if they're 
      stacked above a fullscreen window. (LP: #1046661)
    - Remove ListToStringList (LP: #1046184)
    - Fix typo causing CMake Error (LP: #1045665)
    - Transitions gtk-window-decorator over to use GSettings. Add a testing 
      framework for the options code. (LP: #1042323)
    - Also need kdeworkspace since kdecorationbridge.h is there
      (LP: #1046770)
    - Implements some cleanup that was suggested on the merge for the original
      port to gsettings. Other issues fixed as well. (LP: #1042323)
    - Fix the case where a new gsettings schema got added for building but
      it wasn't recompiled locally (LP: #1046701)
    - Scale: select the window under the pointer, when the scale animation 
      is over. (LP: #1045127)
    - Fixes the some "Use of uninitialised value" warnings reported by
      valgrind (LP: #1004336))
    - Check if org.gnome.mutter is available before using it (LP: #1048551)
    - We don't need to map our style windows, prevent them from cluttering 
      up the paint queue (LP: #1042552)
    - Migrate profile independent keys separately from the profile 
      dependent keys (LP: #1046190)
    - Don't ever enter the subdir of a plugin that is disabled. (LP: #1049100)
    - Workaround SubBuffer performance regression (LP: #1037411)
    - Changed the default placement of the benchmark window from 0,0 to
      100,50. (LP: #1039406)
    - Ensure window decorations always get rendered after the window, not
      before. This is how it was in compiz 0.9.7, and is required in order 
      to resolve unity panel shadow (LP: #1050704)
    - Fix CMakeLists.txt to bring an xslt file back to compiz-dev
    - Avoid a NULL dereference and give a useful error message instead
      (LP: #944653)
    - Fix (LP: #1050752)
    - Check that pixmaps which aren't managed by us actually exist before
      binding. (LP: #927168)
    - Fix flickering and performance problems with using Unredirect Fullscreen 
      Windows with multiple monitors. (LP: #1050749) (LP: #1051885)
  * debian/compiz-dev.install

    - Fix Compiz crash in movementWindowOnScreen (LP: #1015151)
    - Start window decorator when decor plugin starts (LP: #1014461)
    - Fixed: Crash in compiz::wall::movementWindowOnScreen (LP: #1015151)
    - Don't waste memory leaving /bin/sh running (LP: #1015422)
    - Add reliable detection of the compiz bin directory (LP: #1015898)
    - Check if the window would actually paint before painting the shadow, 
      since it is possible that another plugin could be inhibiting paint of 
      the dock   window. (LP: #1012956)
    - Don't insert the window into the server list above the window it was
      created above. (LP: #1008020) (LP: #886605)
    - makes compiz enhanced zoom and show mouse plugins considerably
      smoother to use (LP: #930783)
    - Don't set decoration contexts on undecorated windows, since that 
      might be read later and code will assume the window is decorated when 
      it isn't. (LP: #1015593)
    - Fix potentially unterminated string leading to an uninitialized memory
      read (LP: #1018302)
    - Lift the 31/32 character restriction on key names that was causing so 
      many warnings. It's now 1024 characters according to glib. (LP: #1018730)
    - Don't print the result of BUILD_DEB. It prevents ccsm et al from 
      installing. (LP: #1018916)
    - Use the XDamage extension more efficiently (the way it was designed to be
      used). This dramatically reduces CPU usage, reduces wakeups, and 
      increases frame rates. It also solves at least one observed performance 
      bug (LP: #1007299) and probably several more.
    - Do the initial work to get libcompizconfig under test. (LP: #990690)
    - Add support for initiating window picker in other than nomal mode. For 
      now added only the additional 'All windows' picker (LP: #933776) 
      (LP: #955035)
    - Fixes (LP: #1018602) : An invalid read when using g_variant_iter_loop.
    - Don't allow unbinds of textures kept around for animations in any case, 
      not just resizing. (LP: #1016366)
    - Wait for the server to finish processing requests before doing a bind
      (LP: #1016367)
    - Using the next/previous bindings the wall plugin didn't calculate 
      correctly the next workspace when it reaches the begin or the end of a 
      row of workspaces, so it didn't jump to the next line. (LP: #904205).
    - Added the plug-in "Stack Window Switcher" converted from git to bzr 
      (including full history) to Compiz. (LP: #1012205)
    - Added the unsupported, but fully working plug-in "workspacenames"
    - Added the plug-in "Trip" (LP: #1012213)
    - Add extra checks to avoid passing an invalid xid to XGetWindowProperty 
      which would result in fatal error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter).
      (LP: #1019337)
    - Fix crash LP: #1019337 properly this time.
    - Added .convert files (for gsettings-data-convert) and a migration python
      script (best for usage with session-migrations) for migrating some compiz
      settings from gconf to gsettings
    - Fix CMake error when USER environment variable is not set (LP: #1023772)
    - Avoid severe artifacts and flickering when using LLVMpipe (LP: #1021104)
    - Fix build failure due to invalid sed expression (LP: #1023738)
    - Generate the CTestFile.cmake using cmake itself (LP: #1024214)
    - Avoid random build failures "_intltool_update-NOTFOUND: not found"
      by verifying intltool-update exists. If not, then fail cmake more 
      cleanly with a nice error message telling the user how to install 
      it. (LP: #1023742)
    - Fixed CompTimerTestCallback.TimerOrder failure on slow 
      systems (like valgrind) (LP: #1021139)
    - Fix incorrect shell expansion, leading to invalid "sed" syntax 
      (LP: #1029383)
    - Install the cmake helper macros and check for them in 
      COMPIZ_CMAKE_MODULE_PATH (LP: #1024179)
    - Fixed: schemas were getting installed to ${DESTDIR} twice
    - Reduced combined filesizes of Compiz' .png resources from 2.2MB to 
      1.5MB by re compression of those with Trimage Image Compressor.
    - Added test module for the migration script created by Francis Ginther
    - Adds a COVERAGE argument to compiz_discover_tests
    - Fixed various problems described in bug 1030473, optimizing 
      performance and style (LP: #1030473)
    - Fixed commands addon desription typo (LP: #1033085)
    - Reduced the scope of the variable 'icccm_version', removed a break 
      that can never be executed, added the variables 'frameType', 
      'frameState' and 'frameActions' to decor_quads_to_property in the 
      #else branch in KWD::Switcher::updateWindowProperties () as well and 
      simplified calc_button_size (decor_t *d) in cairo.c.. (LP: #1030473)
    - Always call terminate callbacks for key bindings. ATM we call just the 
      first callback. (LP: #960652)
    - Make valgrind shut up about some known "leaks" in python and glib.
      Fix some leaks in the tests in the process.
    - Implemented single click exit from expo screen. (LP: #1033531)
    - Restore the fix for avoiding re-entering the glib event loop and 
      crashing. (LP: #1036490)
    - Including rsvg-cairo.h is now deprecated. (LP: #1039482)
    - Add keybinding integration for gnome-control-center
    - Separate the configuration for the minimize and unminimize animations.
      (LP: #1036739)
    - Ignore mouse press and release if it does not happen inside of the expo
      screen. (LP: #1036542). 
    - Additional keys from metacity to convert to GSettings
    - Maximize vertically if pointer reaches top or bottom edges.
    - Explicitly depend on resize-options. (LP: #1039834)
    - Add some docstring warnings about using those classes directly.
    - Fix some memory management issues on the mock objects, namely:
      Make destructor functions virtual where appropriate, so that we can add 
      them to lists polymorphically. Support polymorphic ccs*Unref function.
      Also make some other necessary changes to libcompizconfig.
    - Detect if rsvg 2.36.2 is installed (LP: #1039843)
    - GSettings integration backend, created a testsuite for it. Refactors a 
      bunch of the backend code, adds appropriate testsuites and refactors

      (LP: #1002602)
    - Don't drop plugins from the list to try and load before you've even tried
      to load them. Doing so makes missing plugins silently ignored instead of
      an error message (LP: #1002715). It also means valid plugins in more
      unusual, but real locations in LD_LIBRARY_PATH will never get loaded

    - added the transitional package

  * New upstream release
    - compiz crashed with SIGSEGV in CompositeScreen::compositingActive()
    - Window management - Closing one window sends others to the
      background (LP: #888704)
    - [regression] Invisible resize border is now only 1px wide (LP: #953839)

    - Unity 5.8: Can't login to Unity since upgrade to 5.8 (LP: #963465)
    - [regression] Unity 5.8+Compiz 0.9.7.2: Pressing Super+Tab or
      Super+W works, but unity does not respond to when Super is
      released. (LP: #963470)
    - Unity 5.8: Login to blank screen (all black or just wallpaper)
      (LP: #963633)
    - Tests do not build when libgtest-dev is installed but libgtest
      isn't (LP: #964248)
    - Note that this fix is REMOVED for stability reasons:
       Unity/compiz intercepts Super and Alt keypresses from grabbed
       windows like VMs. (806255)
  * debian/patches/ubuntu-config.patch:
    - tweak slightly the shadow border for both active/inactive windows.
    - change the shortcuts as per design request: (LP: #969235)
      Ctrl + Super + D Minimises all windows
      Ctrl + Super + Cursor up Maximises the current window
      Ctrl + Super + Cursor down Restores or minimises current window
  * debian/rules, debian/compiz-gnome.gconf-defaults:
    - move the default for the unity-less default profile from DEFAULT_PLUGINS
      list as it seems compiz tries to load that list, then ccp, then the
      profile list.
    - put the active_plugins list back to the Default profile in gconf then.
  * debian/control:
    - set Standards-Version to latest
  * remove debian/patches/always_replace.patch,

      there is no good upgrade story with the current backend to add a new
      plugin)
  * debian/control:
    - add a libgtk-3-dev dep
    - breaks against previous unity version (gtk_init should run be once with
      ldopen)
    - bump standards-version

      compiz-plugins-default and recommends compiz-plugins-main-default
    - compiz-dev still depends on compiz-plugins as shipping the compiztoolbox
      and cube headers
    - reshuffle the replaces to handle transitions
  * move /usr/share/compiz/kde.xml wrongly set in compiz-plugins to compiz-kde

    Michael Biebl (Closes: #581788). Qt3 is going away, we already use

  * Add patch 015_optional-fbo which adds a command-line option for disabling
    the use of FBOs (work around buggy drivers). Add the --no-fbo option to
    command-line in the compiz wrapper.
  * Remove the --strict-binding and --use-cow options from the command-line in
    the compiz wrapper. These are now the defaults.
  * Add png and svg to the list of default plugins. They are needed to load
    PNG and SVG images (e.g. for the cube's top face).
  * Check whether the GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap extension is available in
    direct or indirect rendering contexts. If it is available only in indirect
    rendering contexts, force compiz to use indirect rendering.

compiz9 (0.3.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    + Drop 012_metacity-theme-support.patch, fixed upstream.
    + Drop 013_fix-default-plugins.patch, fixed upstream.
    + Refresh all other patches.
  * Don't use xsfbs anymore until there's an easy way to keep it up-to-date
    in git repositories. For now using quilt works just fine.
  * Drop build-dependencies on automake1.9 and libtool because we don't run
    the complete autotools stack anymore.
  * Add missing dependencies to the compiz-dev package. It needs to pull in
    all packages required by its pkgconfig file.
  * Add a dependency on libgl1-mesa-dev | libgl-dev to compiz-dev because
    compiz.h includes files provided in that package.

compiz9 (0.3.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: #396770.
    + Remove 010_snap-inverted.patch, applied upstream.
    + Refreshed other patches to apply cleanly again.
    + Remove gtk-window-decorator.schemas and use the one provided by
      upstream (gtk/window-decorator/gwd.schemas).
  * Targetted at experimental until the release of etch.

compiz9 (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Thierry Reding ]
  * New upstream release:
    + Drop 013_dont-fail-if-theme-not-found.patch, applied upstream.
  * Make 012_metacity-theme-support also patch the configure script, not only
    configure.ac.
  * Add 013_fix-default-plugins.patch which fixes upstream's handling of the
    default plugins configuration variable.
  * Make all plugins that were enabled in previous versions default plugins so
    compiz' behaviour doesn't change. Drop the 'water' plugin because our X
    server does not support it yet.
  * Drop --disable-kde from the configure flags because it is now disabled by
    default.
  * Add a dependency on mesa-utils to compiz-core to provide glxinfo that is
    needed by the compiz wrapper. Thanks Per Bojsen.
    Closes: #393113.
  * Conflict with libmetacity0 (>= 1:2.15.21) because it would currently make
    gtk-window-decorator segfault.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Add myself to uploaders. Thierry is still the primary maintainer.

compiz9 (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Thierry Reding ]
  * New upstream release.
    + Drop 011_plane-plugin-schema.patch, applied upstream.
    + Drop 012_freedesktop-schema.patch, applied upstream.
  * Replace 010_snap-by-default by the upstream patch 010_snap-inverted and
    add 011_snap-by-default to enable snapping by default.
  * Add 012_metacity-theme-support.patch which uses an older version of the
    metacity library for theme support so that compiz can be built for Debian
    unstable.
  * Install a schemas file for the Gtk window decorator which is used to
    enable the use of metacity themes.
  * Suggest nvidia-glx (>= 1.0.9625-1). (Closes: #390326).
  * Add code to the compiz wrapper to handle the NVIDIA GLX implementation
    Closes: #390814.
  * No longer build static versions of the plugins.
  * Remove .la files manually because they are not needed.
  * Clean up build-dependencies:
    + Remove unnecessarily versioned build-dependencies.
    + Tighten the build-dependency on libxcomposite-dev to (>= 1:0.3-2).
      Closes: 390304, 390416.
  * Add a manpage documenting the compiz wrapper.
  * Check if the gconf plugin is installed before trying to load it in the
    wrapper.
  * Enable building the gconf-dump plugin.
  * Add a README file to the compiz-core package.
  * List copyright holders and contributors in the copyright file.
    Closes: #392422.
  * Add 013_dont-fail-if-theme-not-found.patch which will make compiz use its
    default theme if the metacity theme cannot be found.
  * Make compiz-gtk suggest gnome-themes so people can take advantage of the
    metacity theme support.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Tighten up all the X library build-depends by explicitly using current
    versions. Thanks aj.

compiz9 (0.0.13+git20060928-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the maintainer field to the Debian X Strike Force.
  * Add myself to the uploaders field.
  * Move compiz.{docs,install,manpages} to compiz-core.{docs,install,manpages}
    so the installed files end up in the correct package.
  * Rename compiz.1 to compiz.real.1, because it's actually documenting the
    real compiz binary.

compiz9 (0.0.13+git20060928-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #352151)
  * Install the compiz schema during postinst and removes it during prerm
    (using dh_gconf).
  * Add patches by Kristian Høgsberg to make compiz work on AIGLX:
    + 002_tfp-server-extension.patch
    + 005_glfinish.patch
  * No longer build the compiz-kde package, because it is unusable.
  * Add gtk-window-decorator.1 manpage.
  * Install the window settings configuration plugin into the right location
    (/usr/lib/libgnome-window-settings1/libcompiz.so).
  * Bump build-dependency on libxcomposite-dev (>= 0.3) because it provides
    the XComposite{Get,Release}OverlayWindow functions.
  * Install a compiz wrapper as /usr/bin/compiz to call compiz.real with
    required arguments (load gconf plugin).
  * Add 010_snap-by-default.patch to turn snapping on by default.
  * Add a versioned build-dependency on x11proto-gl-dev (>= 1.4.8-1) to make
    sure compiz gets built with the correct opcodes for the GLX_EXT_tfp
    extension.
  * Add build-dependency on libmetacity-dev, which is needed for metacity
    theme support.
  * Add the compiz-gtk package containing the former gnome-window-decorator.
    The compiz-gnome package provides the files necessary to integrate compiz
    and compiz-gtk with the GNOME desktop environment.
  * Add a build-dependency on libxinerama-dev, needed to build compiz with
    support for the xinerama extension.
  * Revise the compiz.1 manpage.
  * Rename the compiz package to compiz-core and make compiz a meta-package
    pulling in everything necessary to run compiz from within GNOME.
  * Add 011_plane-plugin-schema.patch by Eugene Konev      gconf settings
    for the plane plugin.
  * Add 012_freedesktop-schema.patch that fixes a typo in compiz.schema.in.
