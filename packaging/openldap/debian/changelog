      Closes: #677158.
  * Incorporate NMU (thanks, Julien Cristau, Mattias Ellert):
    - Disable the mdb backend on non-Linux, it looks like it doesn't work
      with linuxthreads (closes: #654824).
    - Backport fix for shell backend configuration.  Closes: #662940.

  * Install ldif.h in libldap2-dev, now that it's been blessed upstream.
    Closes: #644985.
  * debian/patches/no-bdb-ABI-second-guessing: don't force an exact match on
    the upstream version of libdb; this is redundant with our packaging
    system, and causes spurious errors when there's a non-ABI-breaking
    BDB upstream release.  Closes: #651333.
  * Build-conflict with the ancient autoconf2.13, which is incompatible with

  * Use dh_autoreconf instead of a locally-patched autogen.sh.
  * debian/patches/no-AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE: don't use AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE macro
    when we aren't using automake.
  * Convert debian/rules to dh(1).
  * use DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND with appropriate versioned dependency on
    debhelper and dpkg-dev, so we can pick up dpkg-buildflags for our
    policy-mandated flags - as well as our security-enhancing ones!
    Closes: #644427.
  * Also set hardening=+pie,+bindnow buildflags options for maximum
    security, since this is a security-sensitive daemon dealing with
    untrusted input.  Ubuntu has been building with these flags for a
    while via hardening-wrappers, so the change is presumed safe.
  * Drop debian/check_config.  The upstream configure script now enforces
    --with-cyrus-sasl, so there's no need for a second check.
  * debian/po/es.po: tweak an ambiguous string in the Spanish debconf
    translation, noticed in response to a submitted Catalan translation    
  * debian/patches/switch-to-lt_dlopenadvise-to-get-RTLD_GLOBAL-set.diff:
    Switch to lt_dlopenadvise() so back_perl can be opened with RTLD_GLOBAL.

openldap (2.4.23-5) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * High-urgency upload for RC bugfix.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: fix gratuitous (and wrong) use of grep in
    get_suffix(), which causes us to incorrectly parse any slapd.conf that
    uses tabs instead of spaces.  Closes: #595672.
  * debian/slapd.init, debian/slapd.scripts-common: when $SLAPD_CONF is not
    set in /etc/default/slapd, we should always set a default value, giving
    precedence to slapd.d and falling back to slapd.conf.  Users who don't
    want to use an existing slapd.d should point at slapd.conf explicitly.
    Closes: #594714, #596343.
  * debian/slapd.init: 'invoke-rc.d slapd stop' should not fail due to the
    absence of a slapd configuration; we should still exit 0 so that the
    package can be removed gracefully.  Closes: #596100.
  * drop build-conflicts with libssl-dev; we explicitly pass
    --with-tls=gnutls to configure, so there's no risk of a misbuild here.
  * debian/slapd.default: now that we have a sensible default behavior in
    both slapd.init and the maintainer scripts, leave SLAPD_CONF empty to
    save pain later.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: ... and do the same in
    migrate_to_slapd_d_style, we just need to comment out the user's
    previous entry instead of blowing it away.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: call get_suffix in a way that lets us
    separate responses by newlines, to properly handle the case when a
    DN has embedded spaces.  Introduces a few more stupid fd tricks to work
    around possible problems with debconf.  Closes: #595466.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: when parsing the names of includes, handle
    double-quotes and escape characters as described in slapd.conf(5).
    Closes: #595784.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common, debian/slapd.postinst: on upgrade from
    versions <= 2.4.23-4, explicitly grant access to cn=Subschema, which
    otherwise is blocked by our added olcAccess settings.  Closes: #596326.
  * debian/slapd.init.ldif: set the acl in the default LDIF for new installs,
    too.
  * Likewise, grant access to dn.exact="" so that base dn autodiscovery
    works as intended.  Closes: #596049.
  * debian/slapd.init.ldif: synchronize our behavior on new installs with
    that on upgrades, avoiding the non-standard cn=localroot,cn=config.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: don't run the migration code if slapd.d
    already exists.  Closes: #593965.

  [ Matthijs Mohlmann ]

  * debian/slapd.init: correctly set the slapd.conf argument even when
    SLAPD_PIDFILE is non-empty in /etc/default/slapd.  Closes: #593880.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: pass -g to slapadd/slapcat, so that
    subordinate databases aren't incorrectly included in the dump/restore of
    the parent database.  Closes: #594821.

    as part of an aborted attempt to build the smbk5pwd overlay.
  * Use hardlinks instead of symlinks for the various slap* commands; this
    is functionally equivalent for us, and reduces divergence from
    derivatives such as Ubuntu that use apparmor.  Closes: #488409.
  * New patch, no_backend_inter-linking, to fix the meta backend to not
    try to look up symbols in external objects (back_ldap) that it

    - Add new patch, slapd-tlsverifyclient-default, to set the intended

    - Add new patch, gnutls-altname-nulterminated, to account for differences
      in how the "length" is returned for commonName vs. subjectAltName.
    - Comment out TLSCipherSuite settings on upgrade from all versions prior
      to 2.4.7-5, and throw a debconf error to the user notifying them of
      this, since all OpenSSL cipher suite values are incompatible with
      GnuTLS.
    Closes: #462588.
  * Add new patch from upstream, entryCSN-backwards-compatibility, to support
    auto-converting entryCSN attributes in a previously supported old format,
    fixing an upgrade failure.  Closes: #462099.
  * Use --retry TERM/10 instead of --retry 10 when stopping slapd, since the

    - remove another schema from upstream source, collective.schema,
      that contains text from the IETF RFCs and include a stripped copy
      in debian/schema.
    - drop patches slurpd-in-spool and man-slurpd, since slurpd is no
      longer provided upstream.
    - libldap2.3-0 is now libldap2.4-2
    - build libldap2-dev from this source package now, superseding
      openldap2; closes: #428385, #260118, #262539, #391899, #393215.
    - lastmod and denyop have been moved to contrib upstream and are no
      longer shipped as supported overlays
    - drop dependency on libldap2 and take ownership of the
      /etc/ldap/ldap.conf conffile, since libldap2 is now obsolete
    - need to dump and reload databases again for the upgrade from 2.3.39.
    - ldap_init(3) no longer attempts to document the internals of the
      LDAP opaque type.  Closes: #320072.
    - ldap-utils utilities find LDAP servers via SRV records when given a
      URL with -H and no host in the URL. Closes: #221173.
    - if the old slapd.conf included any replica commands, automatically
      enable syncprov for the corresponding database and print an error
      with debconf.
  * slapd.conf and DB_CONFIG are used in the postinst, they shouldn't be
    shipped under doc/examples because /usr/share/doc can't be depended
    on per policy; ship the files under /usr/share/slapd and symlink the
    /other/ way, which also spares us from dh_compress trying to gzip
    slapd.conf.  Closes: #452749.
  * Drop libldap.so as was done for libldap2, making it a link to
    libldap_r.so to avoid unfortunate symbol collisions.
  * Add new patch, libldap-symbol-versions, to build libldap and liblber
    with symbol versions; needed to avoid segfaults when applications
    manage to pull both libldap2 and the new libldap-2.4-2 into the same
    process (as during a partial upgrade or the initial soname
    transition), and also when the library soname changes again in the
    future (as it's likely to do).
  * Reintroduce add-autogen-sh patch, with build deps on libtool, automake,
    and autoconf, required due to the previous patch; this time around, take
    care to clean up the autogenerated files in the clean target as well
  * Build-depend on libgnutls-dev instead of on libssl-dev, so that at long
    last we can build the server and lib from the same source package again
    without licensing problems.  Closes: #457182, #407334, #428468, #381788.
    Closes: #412706.
  * slapd.prerm, slapd.postinst: drop no-longer-needed upgrade code for
    openldap < 2.1.22
  * Ask about ldbm to bdb migration in the preinst, since there is no
    guarantee that the debconf config script will be run before the unpack
    phase.
  * Don't stop slapd in the preinst by hand, the prerm already stops the
    old slapd using the standard interfaces.
  * Don't build with LAN Manager password support; these passwords are more
    insecure than traditional Unix crypt, and only relevant when talking to
    Windows 98.
  * Move libslapi into the slapd package and provide a virtual package for
    library dependencies, since this is expected to stay lockstep with the
    server.
  * Split slapi dev support into a new libslapi-dev package, as this is
    unrelated to libldap; and drop libslapi.a since it would be insane to try
    to statically link a dynamically-loaded slapi plugin.
  * "checkpoint" directives are no longer supported as part of the backend
    config, only as part of the database config; move the lines around in
    slapd.conf on upgrade.
  * "schemacheck" directives are no longer supported; comment them out
    on upgrade since this option was set by default in sarge.
  * Package description updates; thanks to Christian Perrier
    <bubulle@debian.org> and the Smith review project for these
    improvements.
  * Incorporate debconf template changes suggested by the debian-l10n-english
    team as part of the Smith review project.  Closes: #447224.

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Removed fix_ldif and all remaining code to try running it on LDIF
    dumps. Schema checking has been imposed since 2.1 and it's highly
    unlikely that anyone still needs this.
  * Move the checkpoint directive in the default slapd.conf below the
    database and suffix directives for the primary database. This is now
    required for OpenLDAP 2.4.
  * Create /etc/ldap/slapd.conf owned by the openldap group and mode 640
    by default so that slapindex and friends can read it when run as the
    openldap user. Fix permissions on upgrade if slapd.conf is owned by
    root and mode 600. Closes: #432662.
  * Drop slapd patch to read slapd.conf before dropping privileges, since
    slapd.conf should now be readable by SLAPD_GROUP.
  * If SLAPD_CONF is set to a directory in /etc/default/slapd, assume
    the cn=config backend is used and start slapd with the appropriate
    options.  Based on a patch from Mike Burr.  Closes: #411413.
  * Rework slapd's README.Debian:

    - Document how to direct slapd's logs to another file. Closes: #258931.
    - Remove obsolete information about TLS/SSL and OpenLDAP 2.0 upgrades.
    - Recommend HDB instead of BDB.
    - Generally reformat and reorganize.
  * Patch cleanup:
    - Combine the NTLM patches for Evolution into a single patch.
    - Add explanatory comments to every patch.
    - Refresh all patches to remove diff garbage and trailing whitespace.
  * debian/rules cleanup:
    - Fix patch dependencies for parallel build (hopefully).

    - Add trivial build-arch and build-indep targets.
    - Remove dead code and unnecessary comments.

    haven't used those since the 2.1 upgrade.
  * Update Vcs-* headers for new repository layout.

  * debian/po/fr.po: Merge updates from Christian Perrier (closes: #306229).
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: If the user enters the empty value for

  * debian/slapd.postinst: Make sure the debhelper commands are executed

  * Merged suggested changes by Eugene Konev to automatically run

    + debian/slapd.init: Run db_recover if enabled and available and no 
      slapd process running.
    + debian/slapd.default: Add configuration option to disable it.
  * Applied and improved patch by Matthijs Mohlmann to support migration
    from ldbm to bdb backend.
    + debian/slapd.config: Ask if migration is wanted.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Update configuration from ldbm to bdb if yes.

  Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>:
  * configure.in: reinstate the remainder of the fix for 195990 from

openldap2.2 (2.2.23-4) unstable; urgency=low

  Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>:
  * debian/control: Make the requirement for debconf a pre-dependency as
    we are using it from the maintainer scripts.
  * debian/slapd.preinst: Always use debconf (don't check for availability).
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: Remove the alert_user function which
    was there to output an error message in case debconf is not available.

  Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>:
  * debian/fix_ldif: Add code to fix up oddly formatted integer attribs;
    limited use because it only fixes those attributes that we have
    prior knowledge of (i.e., those in the default schemas we ship), but
    it's something at least.  Closes: #302629.
  * debian/fix_ldif: Also change fix_ldif to not chew up everything that
    has a # in the line: treat lines beginning with # as comments, but #
    is a valid character in an attribute value.
  * debian/rules: Fix the check for missing lib symbols to use
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so the package builds on systems that don't already
    have libldap-2.2-7 installed.  Closes: #305785.
  * debian/po/ja.po: Use the partial translation provided by Kenshi Muto.

  Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>
  * libraries/libldap_r/Makefile.in: Code that uses pthreads *must* be
    linked with -pthread, even if it's a library; without this, the
    libldap_r library ends up with dangling unversioned reference to
    pthread_create() which gets resolved to a wrong version that causes
    segfaults on 64-bit platforms.  Closes: #304549.
  * debian/rules: error out on build if an installed library has
    undefined symbols; future-proofing against a repeat of #304549.
  * debian/slapd.postinst: don't dump and reload directories unless we
    know we're upgrading from an incompatible version!  Closes: #304840.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: don't use merge_logical_lines for
    functions that will be writing back to the config; the code is not
    as pretty now, but the output is much less ugly. Closes: #303243.
  * debian/slapd.examples, debian/slapd.scripts-common,
    debian/slapd.links, debian/move_files: install DB_CONFIG in
    /usr/share/slapd/ instead of /usr/share/doc/slapd/examples/; this
    simplifies the code, and ensures users who don't install
    /usr/share/doc aren't penalized.  Create links for the DB_CONFIG and
    slapd.confg templates to /usr/share/doc/slapd/examples, since these
    are worthwhile examples as well.
  * Updated maintainer scripts to keep DB_CONFIG for LDAP databases over
    upgrades (closes: #265860).
  * Move slappasswd to the slapd package, since it's now a symlink and
    isn't actually useful without the slapd binary (closes: #304339).

openldap2.2 (2.2.23-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/configure.options: Change localstatedir to /var from /var/run
    as the current upstream version adds /run to that during runtime for 
    slapi sockets etc. Problem: The database location is specified relative
    to localstatedir/openldap-data. Another thing to fix...
    (closes: #298271, #304491).
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common (load_databases): Reimplement automatic 
    fixing of LDIF data via the fix_ldif script. Only tried if an 
    initial slapadd using the original LDIF data fails. With this change
    upgrading from woody for some simple cases does work again.
  * Disabled the version check for Berkeley DB in upstream code. Any 
    libdb4.2 package should work but of course using the latest will give
    you the best results (closes: #300851).
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common (import_database): Removed, no longer used.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: Store the diagnostic output from
    slapadd and output it before aborting if the command failed.
  * debian/po/fr.po: Use the translations provided by Christian Perrier
    (closes: #304141).
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: Use the -q option during slapadd to 
    improve performance.
  * debian/slapd.templates (slapd/dump_database_destdir): Apply rewording 
    changes from Thomas Prokosch. Gives the user more information about
    the usage of that directory.
    + Run debconf-updatepo to update the translation templates.
  * debian/slapd.templates: Clean up the debconf templates of the slapd
    packages by merging the changes suggested by Christian Perrier
    (closes: #302829). Thanks, Christian!
    + Changed the wording of some of the templates.
    + Adapt to the DTSG (Debconf Templates Style Guide).
    + Removed item slapd/admin which is not used anymore.
    + Run debconf-updatepo and send new fr.po to Christian Perrier.
  * debian/slapd.postinst: Make a backup copy of slapd.conf before changing
    anything (closes: #304485).
  * Trivial improvements: 
    + Don't ask to move contents of /var/lib/ldap if it does not even
      exist (but also is not an empty directory...) in initial config.

openldap2.2 (2.2.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: Move all shell functions of the maintainer 
    scripts here to have it all in one place.
  * Another pass over the maintainer scripts to remove cruft and tidy up
    the code a bit. Fixed some bugs on the way.
  * Test upgrade and installation revealed some bugs, mostly typos:
    + return in shell actually is "return $?", not "return 0" as I though
    + Referenced $src where $srcdir was meant.
    + Only load old directories on upgrade and not during initial 
      installation.

openldap2.2 (2.2.23-0.pre6) experimental; urgency=low

  Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>:
  * debian/slapd.postinst: Add a testing interface to test the helper
    functions.
  * debian/slapd.postinst: Make sure that debconf actually displays the
    error message even if the user has already seen it before.
  * debian/slapd.postinst (compute_backup_path): Make function more robust
    in case we don't know the old version or the suffix of the database.
    Converted the backup dir to a more simple scheme which should be save
    against accidental overwriting.
  * Rewrote part of the maintainer scripts for correct handling of 
    directory dumps in preinst. New debconf questions etc.
  * Move the manpage of slappasswd to ldap-utils where slappasswd itself
    is included (closes: #300212).
    + debian/control: Add Replaces: slapd << 2.2.23-0.pre6 to ldap-utils.
    + debian/move_files: Move slappasswd manpage into ldap-utils.
  * debian/slapd.config: Don't fail if hostname is unset (pulled from 
    Ubuntu, thanks to Jeff Bailey). 
  * Applied patch by Quanah Gibson-Mount (directory administrator of Stanford)
    to add -q option to some tools for quick operation without updating
    logs. This is mostly for importing directories from LDIF backups.
  * Go back to libdb4.2 as OpenLDAP is known to have problems with BDB 4.3.
    + debian/control: Update dependencies for BDB 4.2.
    + debian/slapd.scripts-common: Mark all databases before this version
      as incompatible.
  * Fix some bashisms in maintainer scripts.
  * debian/slapd.postinst: Include the version of the backup in the 
    backup of a database directory.
  
  Carlo Contavalli <ccontavalli@debian.org>:
  * debian/slapd.init: Print command line if starting a daemon failed.
  * debian/slapd.postinst: Handle hdb backend just as if it was bdb.
  * debian/README.Debian: Add some notes about DB_CONFIG and how to run
    slapd under a different uid/gid.
  * Install an example DB_CONFIG file during initial configuration
    + slapd.postinst: Add a function to implement this and hook it into
      create_new_configuration.
    + debian/DB_CONFIG: Example DB_CONFIG that is installed.
    + debian/slapd.examples: Mark DB_CONFIG as an example.
  * servers/slapd/daemon.c: Actually change the permissions of the 
    unix socket if requested using an ldapi url with x-mod.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common: change privileges of upgraded databases
    as indicated by SLAPD_USER and SLAPD_GROUP variables.
  * debian/slapd.scripts-common,slapd.postinst: corrected some minor 
    typos.

openldap2.2 (2.2.23-0.pre5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Apply NTLM patch from ximian-connector source package.
  * debian/slapd.postinst: Fix small typo leading to upgrade failures.
    Added some notes while wading through maintainer scripts.
  * debian/slapd.postinst: Make slapadd more noisy, writing the new
    directory to stderr if something goes wrong (should help for
    bug #236097).
  * Make slapd.init idempotent by adding --oknodo to start-stop-daemon
    invocations (closes: #298741). Kudos to Bill Allombert for this
    patch.
  * slapd.postinst: Try to fix slapd.conf for syntactic and semantic changes
    introduced upstream into 2.2.x.
  * slapd.scripts-common: Make sure directories before 2.2.23 are dumped
    and reloaded on upgrade.

openldap2.2 (2.2.23-0.pre4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Rename libldap2.2 to libldap-2.2-7 to match soname. Updated 
    debian/{control,rules,...}.
  * Checked the usage of the ucdata files shipped with libldap2 before. 
    Actually they stem from liblunicode which is only linked to slapd. 
    Therefore those files are shipped with slapd now. This change is 
    relevant so that multiple libldap-2.2-x packages can coexist later.
  * debian/control: Updated for slapd replacing files from libldap2.
  * debian/control: Recommend db4.3-util instead of db4.2-util as we are
    using the former version now for slapd.
  * debian/control: Add Build-Depends for libperl-dev, this time for
    real. I wonder what went wrong last time as it built correctly with
    pdebuild (closes: #297123).

openldap2.2 (2.2.23-0.pre3) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/slapd.prerm: Reformat and fix double stopping of slapd. Find 
    out which bug we are working around and document it.
  * debian/configure.options: Enable ACI support (closes: #101602).
    Looked through the source code and it seems to be properly 
    insulated to not make a difference when not used.
  * .../Makefile.in: Remove -s option from install invocations and let
    dh_strip handle stripping binaries (closes: #264448). 
  * debian/slapd.postinst: Code cleanup and reading, unused and duplicate
    code removed. Main body still needs fixing.
  * debian/slapd.postinst: Fixed chmod --reference calls to keep the
    permissions of slapd.conf. Putting data into the file using shell
    redirection recreates the file with default umask and owner, killing
    the permissions we applied using chod --reference after creating the
    file. Instead we change the permissions directly before renaming the
    file now. Wrapped it into a function and update the owner as well. 
    How do we do this correctly for ACLs etc.!? Thanks to Carlo Contavalli
    for pointing this out.
  * servers/slapd/main.c: Log a warning if writing the pidfile or writing
    the arguments file fails (closes: #261696).
  * debian/control: Add missing build dependency for perl development 
    library (closes: #297123).

openldap2.2 (2.2.23-0.pre2) experimental; urgency=low

  * servers/slurpd/slurp.h: Relocate the default spool directory to 
    /var/spool/slurpd again.
  * Merged some changes done by Fabio M. Di Nitto for the ubuntu 
    distribution (thanks, Fabio!):
    + debian/slapd.{postinst,conf}: Checkpoint BDB databases every 512kb
      or 30 minutes by default.
    + debian/slapd.scripts-common: Make is_empty_dir less noisy on first
      install (cosmetic).
  * Applied some changes suggested by Ondrej Sury: 
    + debian/rules: Add MAKEVARS variable and set datadir =
      /usr/share/libldap2.2/ucdata instead of changing build/top.mk as 
      suggested.
    + debian/move_files: Install /usr/share/libldap2.2 into libldap2.2
      and remove duplicate ldap.conf manpage.
    + debian/control: Let libldap2.2 dependon libldap2 for config files.
  * Also in Ondrej's patch: 
    + doc/man/man8/slapd.8: Refer to slapd.conf instead of ldap.h for
      loglevel documentation. Changed by ubuntu? I don't know...
  * debian/slapd.README.Debian: Update TLS/SSL information.

  * Merge new upstream release 2.2.23.
  * Change name of source package to openldap2.2.
  * configure.in: Fix AC_LIBOBJ for configure2.50.
  * Run libtoolize, aclocal-1.4 and autoconf2.50 to get a working
    configure script.
  * debian/slapd.init: Output failure reasons using "$failure" so that
    no glob substitution is done. Had a hard time grokking why slapd 
    would mention the contents of the current directory in its error 
    message...
  * debian/rules: Disable building -dev packages as we don't want 
    other packages to link against the new libraries before sarge.
    Remove the binary-indep target from the binary dependends list.
  * debian/control: Move packages that are no longer build into control-dev.
  * debian/configure.options: Build against OpenSSL with --with-tls
    (this can only be done for slapd itself, we need GnuTLS support
    before enabling this for libldap2.2-dev).
  * debian/control: Update build dependencies for libdb4.3 and OpenSSL.

  * Update configure script using libtoolize, aclocal-1.4 and autoconf2.50
    to fix wrong shared library dependency in libldap2.2 (depended on 
    libldap2 by linking against the system's liblber).
  * debian/libldap2.README.Debian: Move to libldap2.2.README.Debian.
  * Lintian cleanup:
    + Run debconf-updatepo for debian/rules clean and manually as
      requested.
    + Update config.guess and config.sub in debian/rules clean as well.
      First update done.
    + debian/rules (install): Fix the manpage section of the admin commands 
      from 8C to 8.
    + debian/rules (binary-arch): Run dh_fixperms to fix the permissions

  * New upstream release.
  * Disable TLS for now.
  * debian/rules: Don't run autoheader and autoconf.
  * debian/configure.options: Recreated and updated for new setup.
  * debian/rules: Move slapd, slurpd from /usr/lib to /usr/sbin.
  * Rename library packages to include the OpenLDAP version.
  * Remove /etc/ldap/ldap*.conf from libldap2.2 to avoid clash with
    libldap2. Also add Replaces entry for libldap2 to allow overwriting
    for now. Needs fixing...
  * Instead of moving slapd from /usr/lib to /usr/sbin create a symlink.
    Seems like slapadd etc. are now all included in the slapd binary
    and all link to its binary.
  * debian/rules: Run dh_link for arch dependend packages.
  * configure: Fix broken libdb checking which forced static building of 
    back-bdb.
  * debian/slapd.conf: Fix access directive to use "attrs=" instead of
    "attribute=" which wasn't officially supported anyway.

  * Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>
    + libraries/libldap/gnutls.c, libraries/libldap/tls.c,
      include/ldap_pvt_gnutls.h: Use callback with
      gnutls_certificate_set_params_function to generate dh_params and
      rsa_params (this is also the way, it's done with OpenSSL). We need
      GNUTLS 1.0.9 for this. With the new version of libgcrypt, we also
      need to initialize threading explicitly. The previous
      segmentation faults resulted from the *global* param structure
      being recreated and freed for every session. Many thanks to
      Matthias Urlichs who helped debugging a lot and also packaged
      GNUTLS 1.0.16 very quickly... Closes: #244827.
    + debian/control: Add build dependency to libgcrypt11-dev (we're
      initializing it directly now) and change libgnutls10-dev to
      libgnutls11-dev.
    + libraries/libldap/gnutls.c: in tls_gnutls_need_{dh,rsa}_params
      (formerly ldap_gnutls_need_...), create temp files more securely,
      doing unlink before opening and opening them with O_EXCL. This is
      necessary because under Linux 2.6 all threads have the same PID.
      Thanks to Andrew Suffield for pointing this out.
    + debian/slapd.cron.daily: cron job to remove GNUTLS rsa_export and
      dh param cache files every day.
    + debian/slapd.README.Debian: add note that we use GNUTLS rather
      than OpenSSL.

      <kmuto@debian.org>. Closes: #210731.
    + debian/slapd.{postinst,preinst,config}: Replaced duplicate
      implementations of the same functions with one version and moved
      those into debian/slapd.scripts-common which will be included by
      debian/dh_installscripts-common.
    + debian/slapd.preinst: before dumping the database, check if the
      backend is supported
    + debian/slapd.postinst:
      - add -q to grep call for allow bind_v2
      - readded pre-2.1 (woody) upgrade path (that is, dumping, fixing
        and reimporting the database)

openldap2 (2.1.21-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stephen Frost <sfrost@debian.org>:
    + debian/slapd.preinst: slapcat here if possible, if slapcat not
      available then slapcat in postinst.  Also remove old unused
      function.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Check if slapcat in preinst worked and use
      those results in preference.  Also moved to using /var/backups/ldap.
    + servers/slapd/daemon.c: Provide more information on socket/bind 
      failures. Patch submitted upstream. Closes: #94967.
    + ./configure, ./configure.in: Fix check for back_ldap in back_meta.
      back_ldap now included as module.  back_ldap and back_meta appear
      to load fine, though order may matter.  Closes: #196995.
    + debian/control: Add versioned Depends on perl, need recent version
      for migration script.
    + debian/slapd.{pre,post}inst: Allow for whitespace in postinst 
      before database definitions
    + debian/control: Drop the libldap2-dev Depends that aren't actually
      necessary.
    + debian/slapd.preinst: Add create_sed_script to create the script to
      deal with multi-line commands in slapd.conf.  Modify things to use
      sed script to preprocess slapd.conf before using it.  Remove
      support for whitespace preceeding commands.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Add create_sed_script here too and modify
      everything to use it as necessary.  Also change everything to
      reference $SLAPD_CONF instead of /etc/ldap/slapd.conf everywhere.
      Remove support for whitespace preceeding commands.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Removed all tabs.  Changed all sed scripts
      to used [:space:] instead of [space tab].
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Removed debugging statements from ldap_v2
      support handling code.
    + debian/slapd.preinst: Changed to use mktemp for sed script.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Changed to use mktemp for sed script.
    + debian/slapd.config: If no hostname set just use debian.org.
    + contrib/ldapc++/config.{sub,guess}: Resync back to upstream, no 
      reason not to, we don't even build this stuff...
    + debian/control: Change build-depends to libgnutls7-dev instead of
      libssl-dev.
    + debian/rules: Now run autoconf && autoheader to pick up on the
      configure.in changes needed for GNU TLS.
    + debian/copyright: Added Steve Langasek (SL) copyright statement.
    + Patch from Steve Langasek for GNU TLS support, Closes: #198553
    | include/ldap_pvt_gnutls.h: Added for GNU TLS
    | configure.in: Now uses GNU TLS where available.
    | servers/slapd/schema_init.c: Modified for GNU TLS- some functions
      removed because GNU TLS layer does not support them yet.
    | build/install-sh: Added for new autoconf.
    | libraries/libldap/Makefile.in: Changed to compile GNU TLS portions.
    | libraries/libldap/getdn.c: Stub function added, GNU TLS layer does 
      not support TLS certificates for authentication yet.
    | libraries/libldap/tls.c: Now calls GNU TLS functions instead of
      OpenSSL.
    | libraries/libldap/gnutls.c: Added to support GNU TLS in place of
      OpenSSL for TLS connections.
    | libraries/libldap_r/Makefile.in: Changed to compile GNU TLS portions.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: remove temp file if upgrading or doing a
      reconfigure but the OLDSUFFIX and basedn match so that we do not
      move an empty file overtop of slapd.conf.  Closes: #190797.
    + debian/slapd.init: Inform user when not starting slapd due to
      no configuration file found.  Deals with users who select to not
      configure slapd during installation.
    + debian/slapd.init: Removed cat <<-EOF and got rid of associated
      tabs; best to not depend on tab vs. space distinction.
    + debian/slapd.config: Change debconf question names to be fully
      qualified in the $var from the for loop- organization is under
      shared/ and domain is under slapd/, not both under slapd/.
    + debian/slapd.postrm: Can not depend on debconf being around in
      postrm so check before attempting to source it.  Also protect
      against failure from db_get.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Check for old directory and move it out
      of the way if it exists on new configure or reconfigure.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Fix db_input's for error messages,
      should be high priority and need to || true them.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Do not error exit once we've told the
      user about the problem, if there was one, with slapcat/slapadd.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Make sure we get the organization before
      we attempt to fix_ldif on old slapcat output.  Default to unknown
      if the organization is not set.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Be sure that slapd has been stopped before
      attempting to fix and slapadd old slapcat.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Do not use --exec with s-s-d in postinst.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: grep calls need to be || true'd when no
      matching lines found is possible (this case is handled).
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Be very sure slapd has stopped before
      attempting to upgrade database.
    + debian/slapd.preinst: Use either the pidfile or exec if pidfile
      is not available when stopping.  Do not put \"\" around pidfile.
      Use $oldver instead of $2.
    + debian/slapd.config: Reask questions on a reconfigure.  Use the
      same logic as slapd.postinst for when to ask questions regarding
      the db.  Be sure to db_go after db_input's.
    + debian/slapd.templates: Fix allow_bind_v2 short description to
      make more sense since the default is off.
    + debian/slapd.preinst: Use perl instead of sed for handling conf.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Use perl instead of sed for handling conf,
      use old sed method to insert \n's, user invoke-rc.d when slapd
      needs to be stopped.  Assume preinst shuts slapd down for upgrade.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Only stop slapd on reconfigure.

  * Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>:
    + doc/man/man8/slapd.8: Refer to slapd.conf(5) for a description of 
      the debugging level (closes: #176980).
    + debian/move_files: Kill of the static archives of our backend 
      modules as they are of absolutely no use.

  * Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>:
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Add a new function, get_database_list, that
      prints out the list of configured databases from slapd.conf
      one row at a time. Move all of the upgrade handling into a
      loop, and iterate through the configured databases.  Since the
      while loop is in fact a subshell, be sure to handle errors
      correctly.  We also have to look at the configured directory
      for each database, instead of assuming /var/lib/ldap.
      Closes: #190155, #190156.
    + debian/slapd.preinst: Simplify the handling of error status: if
      the slapcat fails, just remove the ldif file.  Also, add the
      suffix to the name of the output file, and add the
      get_database_list function here as well.

  * Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>:
    + debian/rules: call dh_makeshlibs with -plibldap2 rather than just
      with libldap2
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Add question about no configuration.
    + debian/slapd.templates: Add template for no config question.
    + debian/slapd.templates: Add template for invalid suffix.
    + debian/slapd.config: Add no configuration option.  Closes: #87986
    + debian/slapd.config: Complain to the user on invalid domain/org.

openldap2 (2.1.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>:
    + Merged new upstream release.
  
  * Stephen Frost <sfrost@debian.org>:
    + debian/control: Add libbind-dev and bind-dev to the conflicts for 
      slapd, the libs in them can end up being used even when not 
      compiled against causing getaddrinfo() to fail. Closes: #166777
    + debian/copyright: Flush out the copyright file to include all found 
      copyrights and updates to those.
    + debian/copyright: Add clarification of MA license
    + debian/copyright: Add clarification of JC license
    + debian/slapd.templates: More clearly inform users of important 
      config change.  Closes: #194192.
    + debian/control: Remove patch from build-depends (dpkg-dev depends on it)
    + debian/fix_ldif: Correctly handle base64-encoded DNs.  Closes: #197014.
    + debian/slapd.templates: Added templates for asking about LDAPv2 support 
      and telling the user of slapcat/slapadd failures during upgrade. 
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Added support for adding LDAPv2 support
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Modified to handle slapcat/slapadd failure.
      In the event of an upgrade failure the database will be left untouched
      and the user notified.  Closes: #192431
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Use ldif_dump_location in more places...
    + debian/slapd.prerm: Check if upgrade failed and assume bad old init.d
      script was used and attempt to shut down slapd with --oknodo in case
      slapd isn't running.  Closes: #193854. (Again)
    + debian/slapd.conf: Add commented out allow line
    + debian/rules: Tell dh_installinit to not touch slapd.prerm now.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Do a dry-run with slapadd first and check if
      that worked or not.  If it did not work then tell the user, otherwise
      do a real slapadd which should work.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Make sure slapd is stopped before doing
      slapadd/slapcat's and the like. (Note: The woody version does not
      stop slapd).  Closes: #189777.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Check if directories exist before attempting
      to mkdir them.  Closes: #189947
    + debian/slapd.README.debian: Add note about runlevel issue. 
      Closes: #175736
    + debian/move_files: Copy ldiftopasswd into /usr/share/slapd for users
      to use, if they find it useful.  Closes: #94963.
    + debian/slapd.README.Debian: Added note about ldiftopasswd.

  * Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>:
    + debian/slapd.postinst: fixed typos and check for the existence of
      slapd.conf before reading it.

openldap2 (2.1.17-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stephen Frost <sfrost@debian.org>:
    + debian/slapd.init: Add --oknodo for stopping slapd. Closes: #192423, #193854.
    + debian/slapd.init: Change START_SLURPD to SLURPD_START. Closes: #190724.
    + debian/libldap2.shlibs: Bump to 2.1.17- 2.1.12 never hit the archive.
      These should only be bumped when new symbols are added so we should
      figure out a way to handle checking that.
    + debian/slapd.dirs: Added /var/run/slapd for pidfile
    + debian/slapd.conf: Moved pidfile to /var/run/slapd; Needed if running
      non-root.
    + debian/slapd.conf: Clean up config file, be more explicit about what
      directives are 'general', 'backend', and 'database'.  Moved and
      commented out 'replogfile' since it is database specific, wasn't doing
      anything where it was and use of it depends on slurpd usage.
      I consider this solving #151511 since we don't ask if you want to use
      replication anymore anyway. Closes: #151511
    + debian/copy_slapd_dev_files: Added to copy the include files for
      building slapd back-ends.
    + debian/control: Add warning about libslapd2-dev
    + debian/control: Add build-depend on po-debconf for dh_installdebconf
    + debian/slapd.default: Add option for settings SLAPD_CONF file
    + debian/slapd.init: Changed to use SLAPD_CONF, setting it to
      /etc/ldap/slapd.conf if it is not specified. Closes: #91318
    + debian/control: Added libslapd2-dev to control file. Closes: #192163.
    + debian/rules: Added binary-indep to the binary: build line and flushed
      it out to build the libslapd2-dev deb.  Added -k to dh_clean since we're
      building arch and indep debs now.
    + Maintainer upload, acknowledge NMU. Closes: #98039.
    + Add debian/po/fr.po from 194740.  Closes: #194740
    + Add space before ']' on line 113 of postinst. Closes: #194192, #194943

  * Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>:
    + debian/control: Enforce libldap2 to be the same version as slapd
      as slapd (legitimately) uses internal functions of that library
      (closes: #190164).
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Fix the regexp for finding the database
      definitions.

  * Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>:
    + debian/slapd.preinst: don't use debconf or ldapsearch in the
      preinst, as this is a policy violation (even if a previous
      version was installed, it could've been removed-but-not-purged).
      Closes: #189811, #195029.
    + debian/slapd.{pre,post}inst: dump & fix up the directory in the
      postinst, not in the preinst -- using slapcat/slapadd, not
      ldapmodify.  This ensures that the dump will succeed whenever the
      database is present, rather than depending on access to an admin
      dn.  Closes: #190085.
    + debian/fix_ldif, debian/move_files, debian/copyright: add Dave
      Horsfall's dn-fixing script, to handle objectClass upgrading
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Skip the duplicate prompting for the
      organization name; we're guaranteed to always have one.

openldap2 (2.1.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The who-says-slavery-is-dead upload.
  * Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>:
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Fix the database regexp.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Only add moduleload lines *once* on upgrade
      from 2.0.  Wrap the backup code with a check for
      /var/lib/slapd/upgrade_2.0, to guarantee idempotency.
      Closes: #190401.
    + debian/slapd.{config,templates,postinst}: On dpkg-reconfigure,
      don't wipe out an existing config; only merge in any requested
      changes.  Also, prompt before wiping out the existing db.
      Closes: #190799.
    + debian/slapd.{postinst,examples},debian/rules: Move slapd.conf
      from doc/slapd/examples to /usr/share/slapd, per policy.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: make sure slapd.conf is always created
      atomically.
    + debian/slapd.postrm: If removing databases on package purge,
      remove any database backups as well.
  
  * Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>:
    + debian/configure.options: Disable ACIs because they are still 
      experimental.
    + debian/control: Change section and priority of libldap2-dev to
      libdevel and extra respectively (dinstall message).
    + debian/slapd.preinst: Only query the object classes of the root
      dn if there was no error parsing the config.
    + Update templates for po-debconf using the patch submitted by 
      Andre Luis Lopes (closes: #189933).
    + Use [[:space:]] instead of [\t ] in sed invocations since the 
      latter does not seem to work (reported by Daniel Lutz).
    + debian/control: Add Replaces: entry for openldapd since ldif.5.gz
      was included in the potato package of that name (closes: #190660).
    + debian/control: Tighten the build dependency on libtldl3-dev as
      versions before 1.4.3 required the .la file for dynamic binding
      (thanks to Josip Rodin for pointing this out).

      by the failing command don't leave the user alone but print a hint
      to look into the logfile etc.
    + debian/control: Require at least version 2.1.3 of libsasl2-dev
      as this is what the configure script checks for. Pointed out by
      Norbert Tretkowski.
    + debian/slapd.{pre,post}inst: Small cleanups, added some comments,

    + build/top.mk: Remove patch to omit "-static" at linking time. Upstream
      now respects the --enable-shared flag used at configuration time.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Automagically add the module load directives
      after upgrade as needed.
    + debian/slapd.config: 
      - Only ask questions to create a new directory on fresh install.
      - Ask wether the right modules should automatically be loaded in 
        slapd.conf.
    + debian/slapd.templates: Add the templates for autoloading modules
      and fixing the directory.
    + debian/slapd.preinst: New script to support upgrading from 2.0. 
      The old prerm did not stop the daemon so we have to do it here. 
      Also a first attempt to fix broken LDAP directories not acceptable
      to 2.1.
      - Conditionally load debconf when upgrading as it only has to 
        be available in that case.
    + debian/slapd.preinst: Dump database before upgrade.
    + debian/slapd.postinst: Recreate database from dump after upgrade. 
      Move old database out of the way.

  * Roland Bauerschmidt <rb@debian.org>
    + debian/slapd.README.Debian: mention that backend database modules are

    + debian/slapd.README.Debian: Dropped the .la from the module_load line.
    + servers/slapd/daemon.c: check slapd_srvurls is not NULL before
      deref; included in upstream CVS.
    + servers/slapd/back-*/init.c: Change the munged symbol names to 
      init_module, they do not need to be munged, and cause problems when
      they are and not using .la files (which cause other problems)
    + servers/slapd/module.c: Change to use lt_dlopenext() so we don't

openldap2.1 (2.1.12-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial release of OpenLDAP 2.1 packages. Closes: #167566, #178014.
    - this includes support for the >= and <= operators. Closes: #159078.
    - fixes various upstream bugs. Closes: #171008.

  * Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>
    - debian/check_config: Added script to check if OpenLDAP was configured
      the way we want it.
    - Don't build special TLS packages anymore - SSL is enabled in the
      stock ldap library. Everything else will just give me more headaches.
    - Build against libsasl2 instead of libsasl1. Closes: #176462.
    - debian/control:
      - Build-depend on debhelper 4.0 as debian/rules uses DH_COMPAT=4.
      - Depend on coreutils | fileutils. Closes: #175704, #185676.
      - Make libldap2 conflict with libldap2-tls which is obsolete now.
    - debian/rules: Move the long list of configure options to a new
      file debian/configure.options and read $(CONFIG) from that file.
    - configure with --enable-aci. Closes: #101602.
    - debian/slapd.init: Rewrite and add comments.
      - Add support for running as non-root (closes: #111765, #157037).
    - servers/slapd/main.c (main): Remove pid file on exit (closes: #162284).
    - servers/slurpd/slurp.h: Change the default spool directory to
      /var/spool/slurpd (avoids passing it via -t in init.d).
    - servers/{slapd,slurpd}/Makefile.in: Install binaries into sbindir
      instead of libexecdir.
    - debian/control: Add Stephen Frost to the Uploaders field. Thanks
      for your help, Stephen!
    - contrib/ldapc++/config.{guess,sub}: Replaced with current files from
      autotools-dev (lintian). Not actually neccessary since this part of
      the package is not currently built but I think this is the best way
      to shut up lintian :)
    - build/mod.mk: Use -m 644 instead of -m 755 in installing shared
      libraries. Shared libraries should not be marked as executable
      (lintian).
    - debian/libldap2.conffiles: Remove, since we are using version 4
      of debhelper which tags everything in /etc as conffile by default.
    - debian/rules: Change the mode of everything upstream installed into
      /etc to 0644 as required by policy (lintian).
    - debian/rules: Call dh_installdeb later in the binary target so that
      the conffiles are already there for listing. Without this nothing in
      /etc gets tagged as conffile... (lintian).
    - debian/rules: Pass the start and stop priority of slapd to
      dh_installinit in preparation for a postinst supported by debhelper.
    - debian/rules: Call dh_installdirs again.
    - Rewrite slapd.config, slapd.postinst, slapd.templates - a first try
      in getting slapd to configure itself. Way to go.

      - build-depend on libdb4.1-dev instead of libdb4.0-dev
      - conflict, replace, and provide libldap2-tls (libldap2)
      - removed ldap-gateways binary package
      - drop suggestion to obsolete openldap-guide. Closes: #171894, #146968.
    - debian/rules:
      - build with BDB backend
      - run dh_installdeb
      - only run dh_makeshlibs for libldap2
    - debian/slapd.dirs: added to create /var/lib/ldap and /var/spool/slurpd
    - debian/slapd.postinst:

openldap2 (2.0.27-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * [SECURITY]: Apply the patch used by SuSE in SuSE-SA:2002:047

openldap2 (2.0.27-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Make libldap2-dev depend on libssl-dev and 
    libsasl-dev, since those libs are pulled via the libldap.la file
    (closes: #164791).
  * debian/control: Add shlibs:Depends to libldap2-tls as well. Most 
    of those depends are pulled via libldap2 but of course libssl 
    is not among those. (closes: #169950).
  * debian/libldap2-tls: Remove old divertions on "configure" and not
    on "upgrade" - the latter is not really called.

 -- Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Nov 2002 00:35:29 +0100

openldap2 (2.0.23-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Remove search paths from .la files using some perl 
    trickery (closes: #110479).
  * debian/libldap2.README.debian: Document the NSS problem which stops /usr
    from being unmounted cleanly when using libnss-ldap (for more info
    see bug#159771).
  
  * Started cleaning up the maintainer scripts: 
    - Remove creation of the /usr/doc symlinks (lintian).
    - Don't run ldconfig in prerm scripts (lintian).

openldap2 (2.0.23-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * As Ashley Clark found out the preinst of libldap-tls fails for a new
    install. My fault - I did not check that (removing ldap is cumbersome
    if you are using it... :) and the scripts were only checked without
    "set -e" in effect. 
    + debian/libldap2-tls.preinst: Apply Ashley's patch (thanks a lot, 
      Ashley. closes: #162123).
    + Coincidently the other installation scripts seem to be okay, the
      failing command is in the middle of a pipe and therefore ignored.

openldap2 (2.0.23-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply the patch from upstream ITS#2012 to support MD5 hashes. Problem
    is that OpenSSL comes with its own version of the crypt() function
    which is linked in instead of the system's version from libcrypt. 
    The patch changes the link order so that slapd takes the system's
    implementation.
  * debian/rules: Pass --enable-crypt-first to configure to enable the
    patch (closes: #160763).
  * Fix the diversion handling of libldap2-tls:
    - preinst:  Only install diversions that are not there.
    - postrm:   Remove this package's diversions.
    - postinst: Remove obsolete diversions after upgrade.
    - Removal of diversions is done in reverted order of the installation.
  
  * Enable DNSSRV support as requested by Turbo. No Kerberos for now, sorry.
  * debian/control: Updates Standards-Version to 3.5.7 and fix running
    of ldconfig in maintainer scripts.

openldap2 (2.0.23-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Build with --with-tls (closes: #80591, #155937).
  * debian/control: 
    + Add build dependency on libssl-dev.
    + Specify Roland Bauerschmidt as co maintainer.
  * Added the trickery to have libldap2 without TLS and libldap2-tls
    with the TLS stuff. Otherwise we have to change the base system, 
    and god knows how long that would take. 
  
    Most of the changes done by Roland Bauerschmidt. We now build the 
    source two times - with and without ssl. We mostly use the ssl enabled
    stuff with the exception of a libldap2 package which does not have 
    support for that. If you need TLS support you have to install 
    libldap2-tls, which diverts the libraries from libldap2 out of the
    way and replaces them with the TLS enabled version.

    (closes: #148033).
  * debian/rules: Build with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to support files
    bigger than 2GB on all architectures (closes: #155197). As off_t is
    about never used in the source that should not create any problems.
  * debian/control: Make libldap2-dev depend on libsasl-dev 
    (closes: #135223, #96957).
  * doc/man/man1/ldapmodify.1: Fix typo (closes: #105905).

    resolver library everywhere (closes: #112459). Of course, the 
    real solution must be to fix the configure script to not detect
    libbind-dev and use the right resolver all the time. But a work around
    is better than nothing I would say...
