cdrdao (1:1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - Unbreak toc2cue (closes: #222036)
     - Includes newer scsilib version with amd64 support - note that this

       filing bugs about it not working (closes: #249634, #249642, #326472)
  * Clean up dead Suggests relation to gcdmaster (closes: #311738)
  * Fix copyright file to include upstream authors (closes: #337360)
  * Fix manpage to include current authors (closes: #300958)

    issues in cdrdao. (closes: #309735, #133473, #140038)
  * Bump priority up to optional (was extra) - k3b wants to depend on it

cdrdao (1:1.1.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

    build system. (closes: #196614)
  * Apply sourceforge patch #717958, relaxing some assertions when reading
    from certain CDs on certain read-only drives.
    (closes: #189586, #169787)

  * Repackage with debhelper
  * Add /etc/default/cdrdao (as opposed to /etc/defaults/cdrdao) to the
    set of config files read (closes: #149151, #189392). The old
    /etc/defaults/cdrdao file is still read if present, for now.
  * Install a menu entry (closes: #163515).
  * Add README.Debian, with notes about setuid cdrdao and toc2mp3.

 -- Andrew Suffield <asuffield@debian.org>  Tue, 13 May 2003 16:43:52 +0100

cdrdao (1:1.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopt (closes: #192666)
    A real update will follow in a few days; this one is primarily to
    change the maintainer address.

    dependency on autotools; handle updating of config.guess and config.sub 
    in 'clean' target; new target 'source-updates'.
  * [autogen.sh] Copied from CVS.
  * [configure.in, configure] Provide more information when xcdrdao/gcdmaster
    cannot be built. Added AC_PREREQ(2.57) so the gtkmm-config test works.

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@debian.org>  Sun, 02 Feb 2003 13:57:09 +0100

cdrdao (1:1.1.7-0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * NMU.
  * Applied patch from Andreas Metzler which hopefully fixes the "parse error
    before `__const'" FTBFS that most archs got with -0.2: (Closes: #176805)
    * Change some files in xdao: take care that for every '#include <gnome.h>'
      there is a '#include <gtk--.h>' listed before it.
      [xcdrdao.cc gcdmaster.cc ViewSwitcher.cc RecordTocSource.cc
      RecordHDTarget.cc DeviceList.cc CdDevice.cc] I have no idea what I am
      doing but at least it compiles.

  * New upstream version 1.1.7 (Closes: #161885)
     - Don't use and depend on non-free libedc any more (Closes: #162788)
  * Use config.sub and config.guess from autotools-dev (add build-dependeny)
  * remove and generate symlinks in RULES for ia64 parisc(64) and s390
    The last NMU copied the files for s390 instead, making the patch grow.
  * These two things could fix 116782, at least partially.
  * Update Build-Deps: libgtkmm-dev >= 1.2.9
