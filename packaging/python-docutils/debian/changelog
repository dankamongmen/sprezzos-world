  * Suggest fonts-linuxlibertine as an alternative to ttf-linux-libertine.
  * Update David Goodger's e-mail address in debian/copyright
    (closes: #653769). Thanks to Jari Aalto for the bug report.

    fakeroot), and even if they are actually needed, the target will fail
    quickly.
  * Drop obsolete virtual package: docutils-writer-manpage (closes: #631066).
  * Run tests with --verbose.

    files and manual pages.

    + Conflict with previous versions python-docutils

  * New binary package: python3-docutils (closes: #577725).
    + Build-depend on python3-all.
    + Add two patches to fix incompatibilities with Python 3.2
      (python3.2-configparser.diff, python3.2-elementtree.diff).
    + Both python-docutils and python3-docutils provides rst* scripts, managed
      by alternatives.

      alternatives can be correctly installed. Add lintian override for

  * debian/control: Move python-central from Build-Depends to
    Build-Depends-Indep to keep lintian happy; install a source override
    to stop it complaining about python-setuptools in Build-Depends, because
    we do need that package for the "clean" target
  * debian/patches/99_old-diffs.dpatch: Remove obsolete patches entirely, we
    can always retrieve them from svn if they turn out to be useful

python-docutils (0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainers Martin F. Krafft, Simon McVittie and the python-modules
    team.
    - Acknowledge Martin's NMU now he's a co-maintainer (closes: #315285).
  * Switch to dpatch:
    * Update from upstream Subversion repository, docutils-0.4 branch:
      * Unquoted targets beginning with an underscore
        (.. __target: URI) are no longer accepted
      * tools/editors/emacs/rst.el changed license to GPL
      * assorted documentation changes
    * Remove patch bands consisting only of $Date$, $Revision$
  * Migrate to new Python policy, and python-central (closes: #373529).
  * Remove circular dependency during policy migration (closes: #362172).
  * Install tools as e.g. /usr/bin/rst2html only - do not install any
    executables with a .py extension, as pycentral thinks it should
    byte-compile them. Also, Policy section 10.4.
    - Install buildhtml as /usr/bin/rst-buildhtml to avoid namespace pollution.
    - Don't install quicktest.py and the "dev" tools, which appear to be
      intended for docutils developers only.
  * Move some of the documentation from /usr/share/doc/python-docutils
    to /u/s/d/p-d/docs, and compile all the documentation to HTML,
    to avoid broken hyperlinks (closes: #312305).
    - In debian/rules, tell buildhtml.py to give us the full Python
      traceback when it fails, so FTBFSs can be diagnosed.
  * Amend upstream documentation to reflect how this package installs things
    (closes: #293504). debian/patches/10_doc_debian_paths.dpatch
  * Replace all the man pages with a slightly more informative combined man
    page which gets the names right (closes: #325300, #368601).
  * Incorporate rst-mode again, hopefully. Thanks to Sylvain Ferriol for the
    patch. (Closes: #353661)
  * Move debhelper, used in debian/rules clean, from Build-Depends-Indep to
    Build-Depends, per Policy section 7.6.
  * Upgrade to debhelper compat level 5 and Policy 3.7.2.0.
  * Lintian nitpicking: Remove spurious #! line from
    docutils.readers.python.pynodes module.
    debian/patches/12_remove_unnecessary_hashbang.dpatch
  * Stop applying some optparse-related patches which appear to serve no
    purpose. Preserved as debian/patches/99_old-diffs.dpatch in case they're
    useful
