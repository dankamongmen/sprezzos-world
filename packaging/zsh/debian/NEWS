zsh (4.3.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This update includes a rewrite of keyboard handling in `/etc/zsh/zshrc'.

  The used method should be quite a bit more robust than the old one, and
  should work out of the box for every terminal with a working terminfo entry.

  If you do not want Debian's zshrc to mess with your keyboard setup, set the
  following variable in your `.zshenv' file:

    DEBIAN_PREVENT_KEYBOARD_CHANGES=yes

  This change also removes the controversial vi-* bindings for the up and down
  cursor keys (which was reported as #383737 and led to confusion with a
  substantial number of users). If you want them back use the following snippet
  in your `.zshrc' file (and without the above variable set):

    for i in viins vicmd; do
      bindkey -M "$i" "${key[Up]}" vi-up-line-or-history
      bindkey -M "$i" "${key[Down]}" vi-down-line-or-history
    done
    unset i
