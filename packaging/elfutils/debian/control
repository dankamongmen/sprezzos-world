Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, libdw1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: collection of utilities to handle ELF objects
 Elfutils is a collection of utilities, including eu-ld (a linker),
 eu-nm (for listing symbols from object files), eu-size (for listing the
 section sizes of an object or archive file), eu-strip (for discarding
 symbols), eu-readelf (to see the raw ELF file structures), and eu-elflint
 (to check for well-formed ELF files).

Package: libelf1
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Description: library to read and write ELF files
 The libelf1 package provides a shared library which allows reading and
 writing ELF files on a high level.  Third party programs depend on
 this package to read internals of ELF files.  The programs of the
 elfutils package use it also to generate new ELF files.
 .
 This library is part of elfutils.
