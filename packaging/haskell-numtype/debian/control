Description: type-level (low cardinality) integers
 This package provides unary type level representations of the (positive 
 and negative) integers and basic operations (addition, subtraction, 
 multiplication, division) on these. Due to the unary implementation the 
 practical size of the NumTypes is severely limited making them unsuitable 
 for large-cardinality applications. If you will be working with integers 
 beyond (-20, 20) this package probably isn't for you. 
 .
 It is, however, eminently suitable for applications such as representing 
 physical dimensions (see the Dimensional library).
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.

Description: type-level (low cardinality) integers; profiling data
 This package provides unary type level representations of the (positive 
 and negative) integers and basic operations (addition, subtraction, 
 multiplication, division) on these. Due to the unary implementation the 
 practical size of the NumTypes is severely limited making them unsuitable 
 for large-cardinality applications. If you will be working with integers 
 beyond (-20, 20) this package probably isn't for you. 
 .
 It is, however, eminently suitable for applications such as representing 
 physical dimensions (see the Dimensional library).
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling. See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
