notify-python (0.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Scott Kitterman ]
  * debian/rules: Remove src/pynotify.c on clean, so that it actually gets
    regenerated on build. Otherwise some functions like
    attach_to_status_icon() are missing.

  [ Piotr Ożarowski ]
  * Rename XS-Vcs-Svn field to Vcs-Svn
  * Add Vcs-Browser field

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Add /svn to the Vcs-Svn URL to allow copy-paste in svn+ssh:// URLs. :-P
  * Depends on ${misc:Depends}.
  * Fix usage of spaces versus tab in rules; the fix for #434714 was in place,
    but had a syntax error; thanks Martin Pitt; closes: #434714.
  * Ship some testsuite scripts as examples; thanks Sebastien Bacher;
    closes: #440244.
  * Rewrite build completely without the autotools CDBS class and configure,
    make, and make install for each requested Python version; closes: #438928.
