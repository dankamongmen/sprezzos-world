Description: X Color Management reference implementation -- development
 The libXcm library contains the a reference implementation of the X Color
 Management specification. The X Color Management specification allows one to
 attach color regions to X windows for communication with color servers.
 .
 The XcmDDC API can be used to fetch a EDID data block from a monitor over a
 i2c communication. On Linux typical the i2c-dev module must be loaded to use
 this hardware data channel. The device nodes must obtain rights accessible to
 normal users.
 .
 The XcmEdidParse API parses EDID data blocks. The XcmEvents API allows easy
 observation of X11 colour management events.
 .
 This is the development package
