This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the deferred
execution scheduler called at.

This package was debianized by its author Thomas Koenig
<ig25@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>, taken over and re-packaged first by Martin
Schulze <joey@debian.org> and then by Siggy Brentrup <bsb@winnegan.de>,
and then taken over by Ryan Murray <rmurray@debian.org>.

In August 2009 the upstream development and Debian packaging were taken over
by Ansgar Burchardt <ansgar@debian.org> and Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>.

This may be considered the experimental upstream source, and since there
doesn't seem to be any other upstream source, the only upstream source.
