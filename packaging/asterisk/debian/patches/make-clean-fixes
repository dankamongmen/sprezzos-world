Subject: Don't remove sounds on dist-clean

Upstream build system may optionally download some extra sound files.
Thus those sound files are deleted on dist-clean. The tarballs include
some soundfiles tarballs by default. Thus the normal procedure of
running 'make dist-clean' before building the package would delete them.

Not used ATM as we ship a tarball with the sound files stripped out. May be
re-used in the future.
