Description: package management framework for Ruby libraries/applications
 This is a way to package Ruby libraries/applications for distribution.
 RubyGems provides the ability to manage concurrent versions of libraries and
 dependencies between those libraries. Using RubyGems, you can:
   * download and install Ruby libraries easily
   * not worry about libraries A and B depending on different versions of
     library C
   * easily remove libraries you no longer use
 .
 This package provides Rubygems for Ruby 1.8. In Ruby 1.9.X, Rubygems is
 provided with the interpreter.
