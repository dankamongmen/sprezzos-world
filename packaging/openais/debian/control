Description: Standards-based cluster framework (daemon and modules)
 The openais project is a project to implement a production quality
 "Revised BSD" licensed implementation of the SA Forum's Application
 Interface Specification. The project implements cutting edge research
 on virtual synchrony to provide 100% correct operation in the face of
 failures or partitionable networks with excellent performance
 characteristics.
 .
 The Application Interface Specification is a software API and policies
 which are used to develop applications that maintain service during
 faults.
 The API consists of Availability Management Framework (AMF) which
 provides application failover, Cluster Membership (CLM),
 Checkpointing (CKPT), Event (EVT), Messaging (MSG), and
 Distributed Locks (DLOCK).
 .
 This package contains the aisexec daemon and modules.
