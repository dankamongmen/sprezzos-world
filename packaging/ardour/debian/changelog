    readouts from displaying incorrect levels, as seems to happen on fedora
    core 4's gcc4.)

  * new upstream release using scons
  * a lot of shiny new things that were meade incredibly easy by upstream
    switching to scons (thanks a lot by the way!):
    + no split-off of libraries; since these libraries are highly
      fluctuating in their API and only used in ardour, it makes no sense
      to carry around 8 packages on each arch for them. Drop the -dev
      packages in that go as well and build ardour-gtk static WRT
      libardour, libpbd, libmidi++ and libgtkmmext
    + added optimized packages -altivec and -i686 on powerpc and i386.
      Done by rebuilding with scons and template based generation of the
      snippet in control and ardour-gtk-@optarch@.*
    + added -dbg packages with detached debugging symbols (thanks to dh_strip!)
      for the generic non-optimized build; I hope they are not too large...
    + add rewriting of debian/control with cdbs for automatic addition of
      @cdbs@ Build-Depends
    + all the patches we used to need to build against libsoundtouch,
      libgtkmm, libgtk-canvas, libsigc++ are now included in aequivalent
      versions upstream and nicely hidden under the DEBIAN option to scons
    + only install all the docs into ardour-doc
    + most other #include-related patches also accepted upstream
