Description: tools for generating images of proteins or other molecules
 Raster3D is a set of tools for generating high quality raster images of
 proteins or other molecules. The core program renders spheres, triangles,
 cylinders, and quadric surfaces with specular highlighting, Phong shading,
 and shadowing. It uses an efficient software Z-buffer algorithm which is
 independent of any graphics hardware. Ancillary programs process atomic
 coordinates from PDB files into rendering descriptions for pictures composed
 of ribbons, space-filling atoms, bonds, ball+stick, etc. Raster3D can also be
 used to render pictures composed in other programs such as Molscript in
 glorious 3D with highlights, shadowing, etc. Output is to pixel image files
 with 24 bits of color information per pixel.
