dbus (1.6.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge from experimental
  * New upstream stable release 1.6.6
    - CVE-2012-3524: mitigates arbitrary code execution in setuid or otherwise
      privileged binaries that use libdbus without first sanitizing the
      environment variables inherited from their less-privileged caller
      (Closes: #689070)
  * New upstream stable release 1.6.8
    - Revert part of 1.6.6 (do not check filesystem capabilities, only
      setuid/setgid), fixing regressions in certain configurations of
      gnome-keyring

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Sep 2012 13:25:50 +0100

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Jul 2012 18:42:52 +0100

dbus (1.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable "developer mode", which was intended to be off-by-default,
    but was incorrectly on-by-default in 1.6.2, causing an incorrect
    assertion to be hit when starting fcitx before dbus-launch.
    (Closes: #680027)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Tue, 03 Jul 2012 19:33:42 +0100

dbus (1.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge from unstable
  * New upstream release
    - adds new API
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.3 (no changes)

    lintian 2.5.1 by now
  * Add lintian overrides for the empty directories we (intentionally) ship

dbus (1.4.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Do not symlink dcop-howto.txt.gz - no longer installed (this is D-Bus,
    not DCOP)
  * Set the build-dependencies to be enough to run all tests, but don't
    run the tests yet

  * Merge from unstable

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jul 2011 11:26:08 +0100

dbus (1.4.12-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Undo the changed invocation for dbus-launch, which seems to cause
    more problems than it solves (LP: #807614, LP: #809900, probably also
    Closes: #633652)
  * Work around #453755 by just reopening stdin from /dev/null instead,
    until fd.o #39197 gets fixed

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jul 2011 10:45:56 +0100

dbus (1.4.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Override missing-pre-dependency-on-multiarch-support for the -dev
    package, ftp-master doesn't have lintian 2.5.1 yet
  * Check all Description fields for correct use of dbus (package name)
    vs. D-Bus (project name), and override lintian false-positives

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 01 Jul 2011 07:55:01 +0100

dbus (1.4.12-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mention CVE-2011-2200 in the changelog for 1.4.12-1 now it has a CVE ID
  * Merge some things from Ubuntu, via experimental:
    - move libraries into multiarch locations (but don't move binaries
      from /usr to /, which is not needed on Debian)
    - run dbus-uuidgen --ensure in postinst
    - call ReloadConfig with dbus-send in the postinst, since that'll work
      regardless of whether dbus was started with sysvinit or Upstart; just
      call it unconditionally, and ignore any failures we might see (in
      chroots or if dbus-daemon wasn't running)
  * and more things from experimental:
    - improve comments in postinst explaining why it behaves as it does
  * Run dbus-launch for X sessions in a way that doesn't consume characters
    from startx's stdin, or the stdin of certain display managers' init scripts
    (known to affect slim, but not xdm or gdm) (Closes: #453755)
  * Remove the .la file for the debug build, not just the normal build

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Jun 2011 17:21:03 +0100

dbus (1.5.4-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Merge from unstable

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Jun 2011 19:33:40 +0100

dbus (1.4.12-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Don't run tests during build (again), it appears they time out on most of
    of the buildds
  * Explicitly build-depend on automake 1.10, so buildds won't try and fail
    with automake1.9 like kfreebsd-i386 did

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Jun 2011 14:11:04 +0100

dbus (1.5.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Merge from unstable
  * New(er) upstream version fixing local DoS (Closes: #629938)
  * Revert some of the changes merged from Ubuntu, which look as though
    they shouldn't be needed on either distribution:
    - there's no need to create/chown messagebus' home directory, the sysvinit
      script and the Upstart job both do that on-demand
  * Revert changes which are useful in Ubuntu but not Debian:
    - move everything except the library back into /usr; Debian doesn't have
      any uses for dbus-daemon in early boot, and if we do later, we'd need to
      get libexpat moved first
      - this gets the locations back into sync with what it says in the
        Xsession hook (Closes: #630011) and the init script (Closes: #629954)
  * Improve comments in postinst explaining why it behaves as it does

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Jun 2011 23:35:51 +0100

dbus (1.4.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release fixes local DoS (Closes: #629938, CVE-2011-2200)
  * Don't delete jquery.js, no longer installed by recent Doxygen
  * Build-depend on libglib2.0-dev, libdbus-glib-1-dev for better regression
    test coverage (dbus-glib is a circular dependency, but both of these
    dependencies can be dropped if bootstrapping new architectures)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Jun 2011 22:39:14 +0100

dbus (1.5.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Merge from unstable
  * Merge and adapt from Ubuntu:
    - create, chown messagebus' home directory in postinst
    - run dbus-uuidgen --ensure in postinst
    - call ReloadConfig with dbus-send in the postinst, since that'll work
      regardless of whether dbus was started with sysvinit or Upstart; just
      call it unconditionally, and ignore any failures we might see (in
      chroots or if dbus-daemon wasn't running)
    - move dbus-daemon and its helpers from /usr to /
    - move libraries into multiarch locations
  * Don't delete jquery.js, no longer installed by recent Doxygen
  * libdbus-1-dev: explicitly pre-depend on multiarch-support to work around
    debhelper and lintian disagreeing whether it's necessary

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Thu, 09 Jun 2011 08:00:24 +0100

dbus (1.4.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable silent rules so we can have useful buildd logs
  * Update Vcs-Git, Vcs-Browser to the form preferred by the Alioth admins
  * Disable -Wl,--gc-sections and related flags: the size decrease is
    negligible, and these options currently segfault ld on armel and mips*
    (Closes: #628834)
  * Disable the build-time tests for now, they need more upstream work before
    they'll pass in a minimal build chroot

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Thu, 02 Jun 2011 17:08:25 +0100

dbus (1.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Merge from unstable
  * New(er) upstream version

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 01 Jun 2011 16:32:25 +0100

dbus (1.4.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Use a separate build directory
  * Explicitly set compiler flags
  * Don't complain about not installing libdbus-1.la
  * Don't pass a version to dh_makeshlibs -V - the symbols file gives us
    exact dependencies, so the legacy shlibs mechanism is just a guard against
    old systems now, and everyone forgets to update it
  * Do a second build with tests, verbosity etc. enabled, and install it
    in /usr/lib/$DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH/dbus-1.0/debug-build in dbus-1-dbg
    (Closes: #498185)
    - increase dependencies of dbus-1-dbg to allow for this
    - run the debug build's regression tests during build, but don't make
      failures fatal yet
    - build-depend on xvfb and run the tests under xvfb-run, since one
      needs a $DISPLAY
  * Run autoconf during build, and allow parallel building
  * Don't install dcop-howto.txt - this isn't DCOP

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 01 Jun 2011 16:18:45 +0100

dbus (1.5.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Apr 2011 16:41:52 +0100

dbus (1.4.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * libdbus-1-3 Breaks versions of kdebase-workspace-bin and kde-window-manager
    that suffer from #623492, so partial upgrades don't make KDE unusable
    (Closes: #624333)
  * Policy 3.9.2 (no changes required)
  * De-duplicate short descriptions
  * Add DEP-3 metadata to 01_no-fatal-warnings.patch

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Apr 2011 16:11:18 +0100

  * Remove jquery.js at the right location

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Apr 2011 18:04:56 +0100

dbus (1.4.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - Use upstream-merged support for installing HTML docs
    - Use upstream-supplied doxygen_to_devhelp.xsl (the Automake integration
      is still a bit broken, so we build it ourselves)
  * Mark dbus, dbus-x11 as Multi-Arch: foreign
  * Remove the unused copy of jquery.js that doxygen now wants to install
  * Move HTML and text documentation from /u/s/d/dbus-1-doc to /u/s/d/dbus
    (see Policy bug #107073 for discussion), leaving behind symlinks to their
    historical locations; this also results in shipping one copy of
    dbus-specification.html rather than two
  * Correctly credit Michael for his changes in the previous changelog entry

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Apr 2011 16:22:48 +0100

dbus (1.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Switch from cdbs to dh.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 8.
  * Remove doxygen call from debian/rules and cleaning up doc/api manually.
    The upstream build system takes care of that already.

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * New upstream version
    - remove 00_dbus-quiesce-startup-errors.patch, no longer needed
  * Ignore changes to generated Doxygen HTML instead of deleting it in clean,
    for easier use of git-buildpackage
  * Unapply patches after building from git

      (Closes: #540693, #530395)
  * debian/dbus.postinst
    - Stop restarting dbus system bus on upgrades as it breaks too many
      applications and is not supported by upstream in a sensible way.
      Instead trigger a reboot-required message using update-notifier.

    - Correctly get pointer data from DBusString when creating a syslog
      message. (Closes: #574697)

      option file, to avoid calling an external program. (Closes: #570480)
      Thanks to Martin Pitt for the patch.
  * debian/control

    - Drop our workaround for the broken binutils and re-enable -pie on mips.
      (Closes: #533460)
    - Improve the way we create the symlink from /usr/lib/ → /lib by using
      readlink.

  * New upstream release.
  * Switch patch management system to quilt.
  * Refresh and update patches.
  * Remove debian/patches/20-dbus-alpha-unaligned.patch, fixed upstream.
  * debian/control
    - Drop dependency on debianutils as we no longer require run-parts.
    - Demote dbus-x11 from Recommends to Suggests. (Closes: #479341)
  * debian/libdbus-1-3.symbols
    - Update for API additions.
  * debian/rules
    - Bump shlibs to 1.2.14.
    - Add "-Wl,--as-needed" to LDFLAGS. This way we don't pick up any spurious
      X11 dependencies. (Closes: #499650)
  * debian/dbus.postinst
    - Remove chown call for /var/run/dbus as the init script will take care of
      setting the right permissions anyway. This also ensures that we don't
      fail if /var/run is on tmpfs. (Closes: #508931)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1. No longer ship /var/run/dbus in the
    package but let the init script create it.

dbus (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Merge patch from Ubuntu to build a devhelp file; thanks Martin Pitt;
    closes: #454142.
    - Build-dep on xsltproc.
    - New patch, dbus-1.0.1-generate-xml-docs, enables generation of XML docs
      which serve as source for the devhelp generation.
    - Add a XSLT file from the Fedora package, debian/doxygen_to_devhelp.xsl.
    - Generate the devhelp file from the XML files thanks to the XSL file via
      xsltproc in build/dbus-1-doc::.
    - Install the devhelp index in dbus-1-doc and move the HTML documentation
      around; add a symlink from the gtk-doc dir.
  * Misc smallish whitespace cleanups.
  * Start dbus at runlevel priority 12 and stop at priority 88.  This
    eliminates the race condition of starting the X session before hal is
    running.  Migrate rc?.d symlinks from 20 to 12/88 on upgrades.  This need
    to be kept until after lenny is released.
  * Set LSB Default-Stop section to 1 and only install a shutdown script for
    runlevel 1 to only stop dbus when going down to single user mode; dbus can
    simply be killed like everything else on shutdown or reboot by sendsigs;
    drop rc0 and rc6.d symlinks on upgrades.
  * Bump up dbus-x11 conflicts/replaces to << 1.1.2 to match the transition
    version in Ubuntu and reduce the delta.
  * Cleanup trailing whitespace.
  * Drop superfluous exit 0 at the end of dbus' init script which is set -e.
  * Add ${shlibs:Depends} to libdbus-1-dev.
  * Simplify dbus.postinst.
  * Rename patch dbus-1.0.1-generate-xml-docs to
    10_dbus-1.0.1-generate-xml-docs to reflect current patch stack order.
  * Set shlibs via DEB_DH_MAKESHLIBS_ARGS_ALL instead of libdbus-1-3.shlibs
    and extract libdbus-1-3 package name from control to avoid hardcoding the
    SONAME and package name.

dbus (0.62-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sebastian Dröge ]
  * add ${shlibs:Depends} to Depends of libdbus-glib-1-dev, as it ships
    dbus-binding-tool to /usr/bin/. This fixes a missing libexpat.so.1.0.0.
    Thanks to Daniel Holbach for noticing this.

  [  Michael Biebl ]
  * debian/libdbus-qt4-1-dev.install: qt/dbus/qdbus.h is only a dummy header
    file. Install the real one instead. (Closes: #375298)

 -- Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Jun 2006 19:03:23 +0200

  * debian/libdbus-qt-1-dev.install: Make the wildcard more strict so that it

  * debian/libdbus-qt4-1-dev.install: Also install the dbuscpp2xml and
    dbusidl2cpp utilities
  * debian/session.conf
    + Install a custom dbus session.conf. In the generated one some variables
    aren't expanded, causing the session bus to fail (Closes: #374747)
  * Move libdbus-1-2 to sections libs
  * Let libdbus-1-2 recommend dbus. Almost all libdbus-1 using applications
    really need the dbus to be present so the recommends is justified.
    (Closes: #374726)
  * debian/libdbus-qt-1-dev.install: Install all the needed header files.
    Thanks to Michael Biebl for testing a KDE4 build against these bindings.

  * Also, fix an a-umlaut to 'ae' in the changelog to prevent nasty
    debian-changelog-file-uses-obsolete-national-charset errors from lintian

dbus (0.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    + Fixes varargs crap - cleaner patch from David Zeuthen applied. (closes:
      #229274)
  * Added provides/replaces/conflicts on dbus-1-utils << 0.20-4, per -4's
    moving of manpages.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniels@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Mar 2004 02:42:53 +1100

dbus (0.20-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a touch of usage information to the top of the dbus Xsession.d file.
    Also since we've had confirmation that this file does enough, this version
    closes: #230835
  * Add an extra rm -f $PIDFILE to /etc/init.d/dbus-1 to help on restart.
    closes: #229609
  * Temporarily quiesce error reports in system.d/*.conf files when loading.
    This breaks the standard that the daemon shouldn't start with malformed
    configuration files, but at least for now it seems sensible to do.
    closes: #230231
    NOTE: this is likely to be removed in a future version of dbus after the
    configuration file syntax stabilises. Please report bugs against packages
    which have configs which fail to parse with the latest dbus package.

dbus (0.20-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add an /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ entry to launch a session bus.

    file to enable it.

 -- Daniel Silverstone <dsilvers@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Feb 2004 18:15:48 +0000

dbus (0.20-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure the manpages are installed into the right package.
  * Add /usr/lib/dbus-1.0/services to the dbus-1 package. (closes: #230413)
  * dbus-glib-1-dev now depends on libglib2.0-dev which is kinda needed in order
    to get glib-object.h
  * Removed the dbus-qt-1 and dbus-qt-1-dev packages until upstream actually
    do something with the binding (like putting some code into it)

 -- Daniel Silverstone <dsilvers@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Feb 2004 22:22:59 +0000

dbus (0.20-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high because the old package was virtually useless.
  * debian/patches/fix-varargs-usage.diff:
    + Merged patch from Michel Daenzer (thanks Michel!) to fix varargs usage,
      so we don't segfault on --system anymore. (closes: #229274, #229005,
      #229609)

      - Daniel Silverstone strikes again!

dbus (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Starbucks To Begin Sinister 'Phase Two' Of Operation" release.
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    - Drop "lib*" prefix from all packages, and change suffix from "0" to "-1".
      D-BUS isn't technically just a shared library; it also includes a
      daemon.  This could really go either way; I could just put the daemon
      in the libdbus0 package and be done with it, but I think that's more
      confusing in the end, since people have been very conditioned to
      expect libfoo -> just shared library.
    - Add Conflicts: and Replaces: on older lib* packages.
    - Remove Provides and Conflicts on libdbus-dev in new dbus-1-dev
      package, since they are actually parallel installable.
    - Ditto for libdbus-glib0-dev.
    - Touch up descriptions.
    - Update to Standards-Version: 3.5.9; no changes required.
    - Add libexpat-dev to Build-Depends.
  * debian/dbus0.init:
    - New file; runs the D-BUS daemon.
  * debian/dbus0.default:
    - New file.
  * debian/dbus0.postinst:

    - Install configuration files.
  * debian/rocks:
    - Add --with-xml=expat.
    - Update to correspond with changes to debian/control.
    - Make dbus-glib-1 package be built after dbus-1 package.
    - Add debian/dbus-1/usr/lib to DEB_SHLIBDEPS_INCLUDE_dbus-glib-1 so we
      pick up the right shlibs.
  * debian/rules:
    - Update to latest version of Colin's Build System.
