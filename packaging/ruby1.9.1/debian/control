Description: Ruby 1.9.1 full installation
 For many good reasons, the Ruby programming language is split in many
 small different packages. Installing this package will make sure you have
 all the packages that add up to a full Ruby installation, with the exception
 of the Tcl/Tk bindings for Ruby, which are only recommended.
 .

Description: Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby, version 1.9.3
 Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
 object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text
 files and to do system management tasks (as in perl).  It is simple,
 straight-forward, and extensible.
 .
 Ruby uses two parallel versioning schemes: the `Ruby library compatibility
 version' (1.9.1 for this package), which is similar to a library SONAME, and
 the `Ruby version' (1.9.3 for this package). Ruby packages in Debian are
 named using the Ruby library compatibility version, which is sometimes
 confusing for users who do not follow Ruby development closely. This package
 depends on the ruby1.9.1 package, and provides compatibility symbolic links
 from 1.9.3 executables and manual pages to their 1.9.1 counterparts.
