Description: HTML combinator library for Haskell - GHC libraries
 With this Haskell library you can easily produce HTML code without
 having to explicitly write tags and attributes, but just combining the
 operators exposed by this library. It can outputs HTML 4 Strict,
 Transitional and Frameset, as well as HTML 5 code.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC.
