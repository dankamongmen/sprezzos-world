freetds (0.91-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Closes: #852069, LP: #887374.
    - Built with new libtool, so should be compatible with binutils-gold.
      Closes: #558548.
    - Includes fix for upstream corruption seen with Hebrew strings.
      Closes: #500451.
    - drop patch to src/tds/locale.c; upstream seems to now support fairly
      complete autodetection of the client locale.
    - update symbols files for two new symbols.
  * Pass -DDBLIB_UNIMPLEMENTED=1 so we get a full set of symbols in
    libsybdb, even if some functions are not yet implemented.
  * Switch to using dpkg-buildflags for hardening.
  * src/apps/bsqldb.c: fix a build failure with -Werror=format-security.
  * Build-depend on libgnutls-dev for TLS support.  LP: #406468.
  * Build-depend on libreadline-dev, which makes freetds-bin a bit more
    useful.

    worked
  * Drop the unneeded .la files from freetds-dev.

freetds (0.82-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump debhelper compat to 7.
  * Convert from dh_movefiles to the currently supported dh_install.

    bsqlodbc, fisql, osql, bsqldb, defncopy, and datacopy tools.  Thanks to
    Jens Jorgensen <jorgensen@lowtechsolutions.net> for the patch.
    Closes: #196000, LP: #298875.
  * Fix txt2man invocation in doc/Makefile.am so that manpages get sensible
    sections and titles, per lintian.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Tue, 04 Aug 2009 03:56:38 -0700

freetds (0.82-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Maintainer FAIL: fix up the /usr/share/doc directories, which would get
    left symlinked to libct3 on upgrade even though libct3 no longer exists

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed, 01 Apr 2009 03:02:08 -0700

freetds (0.82-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a typo in the freetds-common description, ugh
  * Versioned replaces of libct4 by freetds-common, since the current one
    obviously doesn't have overlapping files.
  * tdsodbc: check for /var/lib/odbc existence before removing it in the
    postinst, since there are cases where it won't exist on upgrade (i.e.,
    if the driver was never enabled in the first place).  Closes: #493303.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat, 02 Aug 2008 11:49:53 -0700

freetds (0.82-3) unstable; urgency=low

freetds (0.82-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #392459).
    - soname bump for libct3 -> libct4.
    - fix support for quoted identifiers.  Closes: #487516.
    - fix for buffer overflow issues with datetime fields and long format
      strings.  Closes: #400269, #353735.
    - fix for dbresults() return value following a NO_MORE_RESULTS
      return.  Closes: #486249.
  * Acknowledge NMUs.
  * Drop debian/{libsybdb5,libct3}.manifest, which are now superseded by the
    new dpkg-gensymbols setup
  * Add locales.conf to the libct4 examples directory, to show proper
    configuration of server charsets when this is needed.  Closes: #390131.
  * Don't install ODBC-related files in freetds-dev.  Closes: #360345,
    LP: #68239.
  * Simplify the debconf handling for tdsodbc: one removal in the prerm,
    one addition in the postinst, and we should always get a correct
    reference count for the driver.
  * Add a new package freetds-common to contain the config files, so that
    we're future-proofed against further soname changes in libct.
    - install the freetds.conf.5 manpage here now that there's a suitable
      place for it
    - now that our -common package is arch: all, don't symlink doc
      directories; necessary in order to preserve binNMU changelogs
    - create the /etc/freetds directory in our postinst if it's missing,
      to make the script more robust against previous versions of libct
      being purged.  Closes: #317677.
  * Miscellaneous clean-up of debian/rules:
    - drop commented-out lines
    - `pwd` == ick
    - use DESTDIR when installing
    - clean up the separation between install and binary targets
    - don't override CFLAGS when building, unixodbc-dev now correctly
      takes care of this for us
    - drop obsolete get-orig-source target, which only knew about an old
      source version anyway; debian/watch works better here.
    - don't ignore failures on make distclean; instead, only invoke it
      when a Makefile is present.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0 (no changes required).
  * Pass -V to dh_makeshlibs, so that any packages that build against
    libsybdb5 with an old dpkg-dev don't end up with broken dependencies.
  * Bump debhelper compat level from 3 to 6

freetds (0.63-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Swedish translation, thanks to Daniel Nylander
    (closes: #331477).
  * Depend on ${misc:Depends} instead of on debconf directly, to allow
    installations of other implementations of the debconf-2.0 protocol
    (closes: #331826).
  * Rework locale patch to allow overriding locale environment via
    /etc/freetds/locales.conf; support "client charset" options on a
    per-locale basis, not just on a per-server basis; and don't pull
    date formats from nl_langinfo(), because the locale defaults are
    apparently insane.  Closes: #324869.
  * Update the prototype of SQLParamOptions so we build correctly
    against UnixODBC on 64-bit platforms

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed, 24 May 2006 19:17:00 -0700

freetds (0.63-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix an issue with the SQLParamOptions implementation not being
    64-bit-clean wrt UnixODBC's implementation; this will need to be
    chased up with iODBC as well as with freetds upstream, to get
    everyone on the same page.
  * Remove a spurious redefine of SQLULEN in src/odbc/odbc.c, as
    tdsodbc.h already includes an appropriate check for SQLULEN

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Tue,  5 Jul 2005 02:43:00 -0700

freetds (0.63-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild against unixodbc 2.2.11.
  * Drop ancient migration code for /etc/freetds/interfaces, which was
    pre-woody and never in a stable release
  * Move freetds.conf.pl to doc/examples, since it's no longer needed
    for upgrades
  * Fix dependencies on libct3 to be strictly versioned, to avoid 
    invalid /usr/share/doc symlinks
  * Add debian/update-manifest.sh and debian/dh_makeshlibs, to
    future-proof against incorrect shlibs
  * Added Vietnamese translation, thanks to Clytie Siddal
    (closes: #311749).
  * Added Japanese translation, thanks to Hideki Yamane
    (closes: #310234).

  * Work around buggy handling of results from stored procedures in all
    versions of libct below 0.62.5 (clsoes: #260261)
  * freetds-dev now conflicts with crystalspace-dev, as we have a header

  * new upstream release.
  * libct0 is now libct1.
  * libsybdb2 is now libsybdb3.
  * Work on the idempotency of the maintainer scripts, so that 1) we
    never remove the driver on a running system, 2) our reference count
    remains net-constant, and 3) we are calling odbcinst so that we can
    provide tweaked driver settings in the package when needed.
