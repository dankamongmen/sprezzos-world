Description: Monad-transformer compatible with Control.Exception
 Provides functions to throw and catch exceptions. Unlike the functions from
 Control.Exception, which work in IO, these work in any stack of monad
 transformers (from the 'transformers' package) with IO as the base monad.
 You can extend this functionality to other monads, by creating an instance
 of the MonadCatchIO class.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC.
