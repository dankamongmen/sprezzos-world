Description: X Printing Extension (Xprint) client library (unstripped)
 libXp provides public APIs to allow client applications to render to
 non-display devices, making use of the X Print Service.
 .
 This package provides an unstripped shared object with debugging symbols,
 useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a debugger; this
 facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding logic errors in
 programs using this library (or the library itself).  The library is
 installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that directory in the
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to be debugged is
 executed.  Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.
