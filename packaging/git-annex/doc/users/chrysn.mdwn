* **uses git-annex for**: managing the family's photos (and possibly videos and music in the future)
* **likes git-annex because**: it adds a layer of commit semantics over a regular file system without keeping everything in duplicate locally
* **would like git-annex to**: not be required any more as git itself learns to use cow filesystems to avoid abundant disk usage and gets better with sparser checkouts (git-annex might then still be a simpler tool that watches over what can be safely dropped for a sparser checkout)
