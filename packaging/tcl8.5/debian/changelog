 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Jul 2008 21:09:21 +0400

tcl8.5 (8.5.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

    convertible to 3.0 (quilt) format (closes: #484915).

tcl8.5 (8.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Quoted CFLAGS in debian/rules when passing to the shell, not when

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 01 Apr 2008 15:10:39 +0400

tcl8.5 (8.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Increased priority of /usr/bin/tclsh8.5 as an alternative to
    /usr/bin/tclsh.
  * Overridden lintian warning package-name-doesnt-match-sonames since tcl8.5
    package contains not only a library, and it's unreasonable to split it
    into smaller parts.

tcl8.5 (0.b3-2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Oct 2007 06:12:42 +0400

tcl8.5 (0.b1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added -fno-unit-at-a-time option to prevent stack corruption in a
    particular use case.
  * Added /usr/local/lib/tcltk, /usr/local/share/tcltk, /usr/lib/tcltk,
    /usr/share/tcltk to auto_path variable. These directories are to be
    contain Tcl/Tk packages according to upcoming Debian Tcl/Tk Policy
    (preliminary version see at
    http://pkg-tcltk.alioth.debian.org/tcltk-policy.html/).
  * Moved architecture independent files from /usr/lib/tcl8.5 to
    /usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.5. To keep backward compatibility tclConfig.sh is
    linked to /usr/lib/tcl8.5 directory.
  * Fixed bug with update-alternatives in prerm scripts.
  * Removed conflicts with tcl and providing tcl-dev packages from
    debian/control to prepare binary packages for default tcl and tcl-dev.
  * Replaced /usr/lib by /usr/lib/tcltk in Tcl modules roots
    (TCL_MODULE_PATH).
  * Removed build-essential package from tcl8.5-dev dependencies.
  * Moved tcl.m4 to /usr/share/aclocal/tcl8.5.m4 to make it easier to use
    different versions of tcl.m4.
  * Removed alternative of tcl.m4 (the link to default tcl.m4 is to be
    maintained by tcl-dev package).
  * Rearranged conflicts of tcl8.5-doc package because of planned adoption of
    real tcl-doc package.

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]
  * Introduced Homepage field in debian/control.

    to a search path for tkConfig.sh in tcl.m4.

    anymore, but needs additional testing).
