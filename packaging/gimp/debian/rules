# PLEASE NOTE: when building a development version or a version where the minor
# library version changes or has changed but the major so version stays the 
# same, make sure to Build-Conflict on libgimpX.X, Where libgimpX.X contains
# a previous version of the same major version of the library. Otherwise,
# libtool will stupidly relink against the system version of the library
# when installing, and create a dependency on the old version of libgimp.
# TODO: maybe set LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead?
