  * debian/c2hs.install:
    - Updated for new release.
  * debian/control:
    - Add alex and happy to the Build-Depends.
    - Drop autotools-dev from the Build-Depends as the config.{sub,guess}
      files are not needed anymore.
    - Temporarily stop building the c2hs-doc package as upstream
      accidentally did not ship documentation with this release.
  * debian/patches:

      does not ship any documentation.

      used anymore.
    - ./setup configure does not create a config.status file anymore, so
      instead touch configure-stamp at the end of the configure target.

    occurrences of 'withObject' with 'with' as the deprecated 'withObject'

  * Set the urgency to medium as the above bug decreases c2hs usefulness
    with GHC 6.6 dramatically.

c2hs (0.14.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix broken debian/rules:
    - Let build only depend on binary-arch as dpkg-buildpackage (and thus

      architecture dependent packages. (thanks Kari Pahula)
    - Fix bashism.  (thanks John Goerzen)

      ${source:Version} to make the package binNMU safe.
