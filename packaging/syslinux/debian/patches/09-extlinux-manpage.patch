+\fBEXTLINUX\fP is a new syslinux derivative, which boots from a Linux ext2/ext3/ext4 or btrfs
 filesystem.  It works the same way as \fBSYSLINUX\fP, with a few slight modifications.
 It is intended to simplify first-time installation of Linux, and for creation of
 rescue and other special-purpose boot disks.
 .PP
 The installer is designed to be run on a mounted directory.  For example, if you have an
-ext2 or ext3 usb key mounted on /mnt, you can run the following command:
+ext2, ext3, ext4, or btrfs usb key mounted on /mnt, you can run the following command:
 .IP
 .B extlinux --install /mnt
