haskell-edison (1.2.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update for GHC 6.8.2:
    - debian/patches/01_update-cabal-file.dpatch: 
      + Add array and containers to the Build-Depends which are libraries
        which are split of the base library. 
      + Add FlexibleInstances, TypeSynonymInstances PatternSignatures and
        FlexibleContexts as needed Extensions.
      + Add -fglashow-exts to the Ghc-Options so GHC will parse
        unsafeCoerce# properly.
    - debian/patches/20_add-haddock-file.dpatch: Updated.
    - debian/rules:
      + The location of the package specification file has changes, so
        adjust the debian/rules file for that. 
      + Add a link to the COPYRIGHT file in de edison-api and edison-core
        directories as the new Cabal version tries to install it and fails
        if it is missing.
      + Remove these links on clean.

        information in the packages.

    - Drop dctrl-tools from the build dependencies as the script using it

      we user dh_haskell_depends.
    - Change the sections of the libghc-*-dev packages to libdevel to fix
      lintian warning "dev-package-should-be-section-libdevel".

      dh_haskell_depends from haskell-devscripts.

        libghc6-quickcheck-doc to the Recommends of haskell-edison-doc.

haskell-edison (1.2.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stop using update-haskell-control and $ghc6_* variables, as it is not
    necessary and not using it simplifies the work for porters and for me.

    - include email from upstream with more information about the exact
      licensing. 
  * debian/control.in: 
    - add libghc6-mtl-dev and libghc6-quickcheck-dev to Build-Depends.
    - replace ${ghc:Depends} with ${haskell:Depends}
    - update maintainer email address.
  * debian/rules:
    - copy the actual package.conf file in which all installed packages
      are registered.
    - remove debian/ghc6 and debian/ghc-pkg6 on clean.
    - replace debian/mk-ghc6-vars script with debian/mk-haskell-depends
      script which determines all dependencies by using the installed
      package description file used by ghc-pkg.
