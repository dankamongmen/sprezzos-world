This is Debian GNU's prepackaged version of GnuPG2, a free PGP
replacement.

Gnupg was originally packaged by James Troup <james@nocrew.org>,
from sources obtained from
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/GnuPG/gnupg/gnupg-1.2.4.tar.gz.
The changes were minimal, namely:

- adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.

The current version was obtained from
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/
