Description: Haskell monadic parser combinator library for GHC
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 .
 Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
 library.  It is simple, safe, well documented, has extensive
 libraries and good error messages, and is also fast.  It is defined
 as a monad transformer that can be stacked on arbitrary monads, and
 it is also parametric in the input stream type.
