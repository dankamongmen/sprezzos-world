stunnel4 (3:4.53-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 4.53.
    - Added client-mode "sni" option to directly control the value of
      TLS Server Name Indication (RFC 3546) extension (Closes: #668041).
    - Added support for IP_FREEBIND socket option with a pached Linux kernel.
    - Glibc-specific dynamic allocation tuning was applied to help unused memory
      deallocation.
    - Non-blocking OCSP implementation.
    - Various other bugfixes, see upstream changelog for details.

  * Enabled hardening compile flags. There were NO compile time warning messages
    or errors triggered because of this.

  * Updated to Standards-Version 3.9.3. No changes required.
    - Migrating to /run from /var/run will be a hard problem, because we expect
      user written config files to refer to the directory. We'll punt on making
      this change for now.
  * Updated copyright years to 2012.
  * Added Description: LSB header to init script.

stunnel4 (3:4.52-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 4.52.
  * Do not enable chroot in sample config file. It is misleading to users, it
    suggests it can be used with no further changes. Closes: #652812
  * Remove log files on purge. Closes: #657135

stunnel4 (3:4.51~b5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 
    - Fixed exec+connect sections (Closes: #653882).
    - New "compression = deflate" global option to enable RFC 2246 compression.
      For compatibility with previous versions "compression = zlib" and
      "compression = rle" also enable the deflate (RFC 2246) compression.
    - Separate default ciphers and sslVersion for "fips = yes" and "fips = no".

stunnel4 (3:4.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Releases. Highlights:
    + 4.46:
      - Added Unix socket support (e.g. "connect = /var/run/stunnel/socket").
      - Added "verify = 4" mode to ignore CA chain and only verify peer
        certificate.
      - Removed the limit of 16 IP addresses for a single 'connect' option.
      - Removed the limit of 256 stunnel.conf sections in PTHREAD threading
        model.
    + 4.45:
      - "protocol = proxy" support to send original client IP address to haproxy
         http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt
         This requires accept-proxy bind option of haproxy 1.5-dev3 or later.
      - Libwrap helper processes are no longer started if libwrap is disabled
        in all sections of the configuration file.
      - Fixed -l option handling in stunnel3 script (thx to Kai Gülzau).
      - Script to build default stunnel.pem was fixed (thx to Sebastian Kayser).
    + 4.44:
      - Heap buffer overflow protection with canaries.
      - Stack buffer overflow protection with -fstack-protector.
      - Fixed garbled error messages on errors with setuid/setgid options.
    + 4.43:
      - Major optimization of the logging subsystem.
        Benchmarks indicate up to 15% stunnel performance improvement.
  * Remove config.guess and config.sub in clean target, otherwise build fails
    because of changes in source outside of a patch. Found and fixed by
    Peter Eisentraut <petere@debian.org> (Closes: #647176).
  * Updated watchfile to new upstream's directory structure for archived
    releases.

 -- Luis Rodrigo Gallardo Cruz <rodrigo@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Dec 2011 06:39:09 -0800

stunnel4 (3:4.42-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Release.
   - Fixed a heap corruption vulnerability in versions 4.40 and 4.41.  It may
     possibly be leveraged to perform DoS or remote code execution attacks.
     (Closes: #638758)
   - New verify level 0 to request and ignore peer certificate.

 -- Luis Rodrigo Gallardo Cruz <rodrigo@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Aug 2011 08:34:43 -0700

stunnel4 (3:4.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Release:
   - Hardcoded 2048-bit DH parameters are used as a fallback if DH parameters
     are not provided in stunnel.pem.
   - Default "ciphers" value updated to prefer ECDH:
     "ALL:!SSLv2:!aNULL:!EXP:!LOW:-MEDIUM:RC4:+HIGH".
   - Default ECDH curve updated to "prime256v1".
   - Removed support for temporary RSA keys (used in obsolete export ciphers).

stunnel4 (3:4.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Releases. Highlights:
   + 4.38:
     - Server-side SNI implemented (RFC 3546 section 3.1) with a new
       service-level option "nsi".
     - "socket" option also accepts "yes" and "no" for flags.
     - Nagle's algorithm is now disabled by default for improved interactivity.
     - Bugfix: Signal pipe set to non-blocking mode.  This bug caused
       hangs of stunnel features based on signals, e.g. local mode, FORK
       threading, or configuration file reload on Unix.  Win32 platform was
       not affected.
   + 4.37:
     - Client-side SNI implemented (RFC 3546 section 3.1).
     - Default "ciphers" changed from the OpenSSL default to a more secure
       and faster "RC4-MD5:HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2".
       A paranoid (and usually slower) setting would be "HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2".
     - Recommended "options = NO_SSLv2" added to the sample stunnel.conf file.
     - Default client method upgraded from SSLv3 to TLSv1.
       To connect servers without TLS support use "sslVersion = SSLv3" option.
     - Bugfix: Non-blocking socket handling in local mode fixed
       (Closes: #626856).
   + 4.36:
     - Dynamic memory management for strings manipulation:
       no more static STRLEN limit, lower stack footprint. (Closes: #594876).
     - Strict public key comparison added for "verify = 3" certificate
       checking mode (thx to Philipp Hartwig).
   For more details see upstream ChangeLog.

  * Removed /usr/lib/stunnel/libstunnel.la file.
  * Support restarting selected stunnel instances. Thanks Peter Palfrader.
    (Closes: #627765).

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2. No changes needed.
  * Remove /etc/stunnel/stunnel4.conf file as it is useless, except as a sample.
    A README file for /etc/stunnel was provided (Closes: #549384).
  * Minor cleanup of debian/rules, no longer runs configure twice.

stunnel4 (3:4.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
   - Binaries moved from /usr/sbin to /usr/bin. Thus, Debian no longer
    diverges in that from upstream.
   - libstunnel.so migrated inside /usr/lib/stunnel.
   - Preliminary FIPS 140-2 support, but this package does not include it,
    as it requires static compilation.
   - Miscelaneous bugfixing.
  * debian/patches/no_zlib_link:
   - Rebased. Only line numbering changed.
  * debian/patches/libstunnel_is_private_lib:
   - Removed. Included upstream.
  * debian/patches/fix-paths:
   - Remove hunks related to moving binaries to /usr/bin. Refresh line numbers
    in the rest.
  * debian/patches/rename-binary:
   - Rebased. Minor changes due to changed dates in the manpage and the use of
    @prefix@ in src/stunnel3.in.
  * debian/patches/setuid.patch:
   - Patch from upstream to allow using setuid/setgid with /etc/passwd and
    /etc/group not within chrooted directory.
  * debian/README.Debian:
   - Add explanation about not turning FIPS mode on.
   - Reword warning about binaries changing place.
  * debian/rules, debian/stunnel4.manpages:

    anyways.
   - Ship fr and pl manpages.
   - Do not pass --host to configure if not cross compiling.
   - Reorder target dependencies. This should avoid problems when doing
    paralell builds.
  * debian/control:
   - Remove XS- prefix from Vcs-* fields.
   - Add Homepage: field.
   - Correct minor typo in dummy package's description.
   - Version build dependency on quilt, since we require

    debian/dirs. Explicitely create the first if needed to install an
    override file, and explicitely remove the later after moving the
    binaries, in debian/rules.
  * Move StunnelConf-0.1.pl into /usr/share/doc/stunnel4/contrib. Remove
    it from debian/docs and explicitely install it in dh_install call.

    zlib. This library is a dependency of openssl, but not of ours.
  * Rewrite changelog entries from previous version, adding mention of
    modified files.
