  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Drop debian/scripts/debconf-updatepo, it looks like we're not using it
    anymore.
  * Update debian/copyright to
    - add missing copyright statements
    - add missing license notes
    - not pretend the Debian and Ubuntu packages have different copyright
      status; parts of the package are copyright Canonical, others are
      copyright by various Debian folks.
    Still unclear if the "Copyright Software in the Public Interest, Inc."
    bits make sense, so leave them in for now.
    Closes: #630830.

  * Drop some videos drivers from the xserver-xorg-video-all meta package
    on ia64, they were dropped following the domain I/O support code removal
    in X server 1.12.

  * Fix unsafe manipulation of /tmp/.X11-unix and /tmp/.ICE-unix in the
    x11-common init script.  A malicious user could trick us into changing
    ownership/permissions of an arbitrary directory, and elevate their
    privileges (closes: #661627).  Reference: CVE-2012-1093.  Thanks to
    "vladz", Tim Morgan and Bernhard R. Link for their help getting this right
    (any remaining bugs are my own).

  * Team upload.
  * debian/local/Xsession.d/35x11-common_xhost-local: add a new script 
    to the default X session. It will give access to the running X 
    server to the logged on user. This is useful for gdm3 which does not 
    give access to $XAUTHORITY outside the session, but can also be of 
    use for other display managers. Closes: #586685.

xorg (1:7.6+10) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixes for xserver-wrapper:
    - when we drop privileges, don't forget to also reset effective group id,
      since we're installed setgid root.
    - revert change to allow devices with major 5 as consoles.  This includes
      things like /dev/tty and /dev/ptmx, which are world-readable (closes:
      #652249).  Thanks to vladz for the report.
      Reference: CVE-2011-4613.
    - use major() and minor() macros instead of manually extracting them

  * Adjust build system and build-dependencies accordingly:
    - Add asciidoc build-dep.
    - Remove markdown build-dep.
    - Remove wkhtmltopdf, xauth, xvfb build-dep.

    - Add: reference/upstream-contacts
    - Update: howtos/report-bugs
  * rules: Get rid of DEFAULT_DCRESOLUTIONS, unused since 2009.
  * Fix /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config handling:
    - Don't forget to copy the new configuration file if there was none
      previously. Thanks to Kyle Dassoff (Closes: #612979).
  * As a consequence of this bug, users having installed x11-common using
    version 1:7.6+1 or 1:7.6+2 want to run “dpkg-reconfigure x11-common”
    to generate the Xwrapper.config file.
  * Use “tempfile -m 644” to generate the temporary file which gets copied
    back into place. There's no secret in there (Closes: #581338).
  * 50x11-common_determine-startup: Take $SHELL into account, defaulting
    to sh if SHELL is unset or null (Closes: #604010).
  * Fix FTBFS on sparc{,64} by working around wkhtmltopdf's #613141:
    remove the SVG file from the CSS on these architectures.

xorg (1:7.6+2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge xsf-docs documentation. That's an offline copy of the
    documentation available online (http://pkg-xorg.alioth.debian.org/) in
    the following formats: HTML, PDF, and TXT.
  * Call make/make clean in xsf-docs/ accordingly. Do the “make” part
    under xvfb-run since wkhtmltopdf requires a working display, at least
    at the moment.
  * Ship xsf-docs in the xserver-xorg metapackage, under the following
    directory: /usr/share/doc/xorg
  * Add build-deps accordingly:
    - markdown: .mdwn to .html
    - wkhtmltopdf: .html to .pdf
    - xvfb: wkhtmltopdf needs a display.
    - xauth: xvfb-run needs it.
  * Remove xbase-clients maintainer scripts: Stop caring about
    /etc/X11/app-defaults/Beforelight, which was needed while upgrading
    from versions earlier than 1:7.4+2. Now even squeeze has a newer
    version.
  * Ditto for xutils: Stop caring about /etc/X11/rstart, 1:7.3+11 was a
    long time ago.
  * Tighten the dependency between xorg and xserver-xorg, to prevent from
    being able to upgrade xorg only (e.g. to X11R7.6) while still having
    xserver-xorg and xserver-xorg-core in a lower version (e.g. X11R7.5).
  * Ship a bug control file for xorg, making it report-with: xserver-xorg,
    which gives us the exact version of the server (the bug script isn't
    always sufficient), but also the drivers.
  * Remove obsolete material:
    - dexconf: Good bye!
    - xorg.conf: No real need for an example, with autodetection. If some
      documentation is still needed, it can be added to xsf-docs.

  * x11-common: drop usage of /var/lib/x11/Xwrapper.config.{md5sum,roster}.
    Since sarge (I think), no other package has been handling
    /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config, so assume we're the only owner, remove the state
    files on upgrade.  The checksum is also not needed, we read the
    allowed_users value from the file in the config script and preserve it.
    Closes: #611271.

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Make xserver-xorg-video-nouveau a dependency again.
  * Make xserver-xorg-video-geode a recommended package. It's not
    maintained by the X Strike Force, and that shouldn't prevent
    xserver-xorg-video-all from being installable.
  * xserver-wrapper.c: Fix compilation warnings.

  * Add variables to handle Recommends.
  * Downgrade xserver-xorg-video-nouveau from Depends to Recommends. The
    frequent ABI changes make it difficult to manage, but that shouldn't
    stop people from using the xserver-xorg-video-all metapackage.
  * Downgrade xserver-xorg-input-wacom from Depends to Recommends. This is
    only an interim measure aiming at making xserver-xorg-input-all
    installable again. This input driver will probably be promoted to
    Depends again when it is ready™.

  * Also drop Pre-Depends on debconf.  The debconf interaction in
    x11-common.preinst was removed in 1:7.4+2.
  * Drop versioned build-dep on dpkg 1.7.0.  Even woody had that..
  * Drop x11-common Depends on debianutils 1.13.  That was also in woody.

    modesetting for radeon, and that clashes with this driver.
  * Drop v4l from xserver-xorg-video-all.  It depends on the obsolete V4L1

  * Don't write the default depth to xorg.conf any more.

  * Don't bother with resolutions in xorg.conf
    We now rely on the server and drivers to do the right thing. Previously,
    our best-case scenario was to have the xserver-xorg postinstall script ask
    the monitor what the optimal values were, and if that wasn't possible to
    give the user a default list of resolutions and a best-guess hsync and
    vrefresh values that the user could override. The server and almost all
    drivers will do this on boot anyway using properly maintained code, which
    allows them to better adapt to changes. randr 1.2-compliant drivers will
    do this even better than we possibly could. Finally, the server will
    provide a better list of defaults than we were doing anyway. There will
    undoubtedly be bugs uncovered by this change, but we need  to find and fix
    the actual bugs in the drivers and server in order to move forward.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Get rid of all the explicit modes by default. They just bloated the
    default config for no reason.
    + The /config/display/modes now has no default (blank). As a result of
      this, under normal conditions, this multi-select field will be empty.
      The debconfage and dexconf will not fill in this section at all. The
      server will then choose the highest resolution that it can probe with
      DDC. This should work for most people, who are probably choosing their
      best resolution anyway. If xresprobe is available and used, the
      resolutions it finds will be selected. Until there is a good way for the
      server to store this information by itself, we should leave this as it
      is. Most people can get by without this section, but it'll help some of
      those with broken hardware.
    + If the user does select a mode or modes for this question, dexconf no
      longer iterates through a set of depths and puts the mode list in for
      each. Instead, if dexconf does find a set of specified modes, it will
      write a single "Display" subsection for the screen, and it will contain
      the modes. This is functionally equivalent to what we were doing anyway,
      and it cuts down the number of lines in our xorg.conf considerably.

  * Remove xserver-xorg-video-{newport,tga} from XSERVER_XORG_VIDEO_DEPENDS
    on sparc, since these drivers do not built on sparc (sparc is not in
    the arch list). Thanks to Julien Cristau for pointing it out.
  * Fix the currently broken sparc hardware detection in config and
    postinst scripts:
    - introduce a new discover_sparc_video() function which uses prtconf
      rather than discover to do the hardware detection. discover does not
      support detection of devices attached to UPA and SBUS buses, common
      on sparc, so it's pretty useless there.
    - use this function on sparc by introducing the DISCOVER_PROG and
      DISCOVER_FUNC variables, preserving the old behavior for all other
      arches. Adjust the debugging messages appropriately.
    - set the default sparc driver to 'sunffb'.
    - set default keyboard rules for sparc to 'xorg' instead of obsolete
      'sun'. The keyboard layer in 2.6 kernels have been unified across
      all arches, so 'xorg' is the correct setting now.
    - add 'cfb' and 'cfb32' to the list of modules loaded by default on
      sparc, since the symbols provided by them are required by sunffb
      driver. Closes: #352869, #377809

  * On xserver-xorg postinst, reconfigure for all versions less than or equal
    to this one. This will only occur if the file is not customized. This will
    automatically correct for new font and xkb data paths. Users with
    customized files will have to make the necessary changes, documented in
    the NEWS.Debian file for the xserver-xorg-core package.
  * Have x11-common conflict with packages installing binaries to
    /usr/X11R6/bin. We need to remove them in order to install a proper
    symlink at this location to /usr/bin. Packages will still be able to
    install to /usr/X11R6/bin, but they need to be removed from the system
    first so that we can set up the symlink and not drop them out of the path.
    Thanks Steve Langasek. (closes: #362524, #362200)
  * Symlink /usr/X11R6/bin to /usr/bin in x11-common.postinst. Thanks Steve
    Langasek.
  * Several fixes for fonts. Include /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts as a directory
    in x11-common for font packages that have not transitioned to the new
    directory. /usr/lib/X11/fonts symlinks to this directory. Both of these
    used to be symlinks to /usr/share/fonts/X11 but no longer. We explicitly
    remove the symlink at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts in the x11-common preinst
    to ensure this transition. Thanks Eugene Konev.
  * Document the change of PATH to /usr/X11R6/bin in x11-common NEWS.Debian
    file. Thanks Joey Hess. (closes: #362222)
  * Have x11-common conflict with libxft-dev <= 2.1.8.2-5. Thanks Margarita
    Manterola. (closes: #362255)
  * Document the metapackage name change in x11-common's NEWS.Debian.
  * Have xserver-xorg depend on xbase-clients
  * Ensure that config file md5sum gets migrated from /var/lib/xfree86 to
    /var/libx11. To do so, separate the test for it from the roster file in
    the xserver-xorg preinst. Properly handle the migration itself as well by
    using better variables in the mv command. Thanks Justin Pryzby.
    (closes: #331690)
  * Similarly separate the md5sum for the server symlink from the roster. Also
    handle the case where the server symlink md5sum is removed but the symlink
    itself is in place. Here we just remake the md5sum using that symlink
    silently.

xorg (1:7.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

    for the bug report and Ari Pollak for the fix.
  * Upload to unstable

xorg (1:7.0.8) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add vars files for alpha, m68k, mips, mipsel, and arm. These are crude
    currently and definitely need refining from actual porters. If we're
    building useless drivers for your arch and including them in the
    metapackage, let us know and we'll disable them. Thanks Julien Cristau and
    Martin Michlmayr.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Tue,  4 Apr 2006 23:06:38 -0400

xorg (1:7.0.7) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add x11-common conflicts with monolithic versions of xserver-xorg. This
    will prevent the modular packages from screwing up old installations due
    to a partial install. Thanks Steve Langasek.
  * Add xlibs-static-dev transitional metapackage

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Mar 2006 19:18:31 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * At the urgent request of the release and ftp teams, xlibs must die. Have
    the xserver-xorg package recommend xkb-data instead. xkb-data should
    already be pulled in by several pieces including the xorg metapackage,
    xutils, and xbase-clients
  * Double the font compatibility symlink. One set at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts
    and one at /usr/lib/X11/fonts. Both point to /usr/share/fonts/X11, which
    is our home for the fonts.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Mar 2006 23:29:42 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Have xserver-xorg conflict and replace xserver-common. Thanks Miles Bader.

xorg (1:7.0.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Name rgb.txt symlink properly so that the xserver actually finds it.
    Thanks Luca Capello.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Mar 2006 12:58:04 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Include rgb.txt from rgb 1.0.0 upstream release. Also provide symlink to
    /usr/share/X11 so that the server knows where to look. Thanks Lukasz
    Panowski. (closes: #356039)
  * Update dexconf for new font location. Thanks Svante Signell.
    (closes: #356181)

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Mar 2006 19:04:46 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Have xorg-dev only depend on libxaw7-dev, not 6. Thanks Carsten Luedtke.
    (closes: #355703)

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Mar 2006 20:12:28 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * xorg depends on libgl1-mesa-glx now instead of the ubuntu package name.
    Thanks anonymous dude on my blog who should have used reportbug instead.
  * Provide compatibility packages for the Xorg 6.9 mesa packages. This
    package will be the only source of mesa packages in Debian for the
    present, and these packages will provide for smooth upgrades and
    compatibility.
  * Provide versioned dependencies for all the stuff xorg depends on.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Feb 2006 01:13:18 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian
  * Add an epoch due to idiocy while working on aborted experimental packages
  * This is a Debian-native package so version it accordingly
  * Remove xbase-clients and xutils metapackages. We're just bundling the apps
    in to one big source package right now
  * Convert to xsfbs
    + shell-lib.sh deleted in favor of xsfbs/xsfbs.sh
    + use targets for script generation and such from xsfbs/xsfbs.mk
  * Change driver metapackage naming to match individual packages:
    + xserver-xorg-driver -> xserver-xorg-video
    + Update the packaging variables that define arch-specific drivers to
      include in the metapackage as well to match these names
  * Remove extra depends on x11-common from xserver-xorg
  * Add debconf dependency for xserver-xorg
  * setuid for /usr/bin/X (stolen from monolith's debian/rules)
  * Provide xlibs and xlibs-data transitional packages. These are empty
    packages that depend on the packages that replace them.
  * Create an xorg metapackage that provides x-window-system(-core). This is a
    simpler name and should suffice. We don't need this split between -system
    and -system-core. If people want twm and so forth they can install it.
    This package installs -core plus xterm currently.
  * Re-add x-window-system-dev package under the new name of xorg-dev. Note to
    packagers: this is not meant to be build-dep'ed on, but is a convenience
    package for users.
  * Provide a compatibility symlink to /usr/lib/X11/fonts (their new home) at
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts. This will let external fonts work as expected.
    Thanks Eugene Konev.

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu14) dapper; urgency=low

  * Support preseeding of xserver-xorg/config/display/default_depth even
    when autodetecting video. (Unfortunately, this will mean that people get
    the wrong default presented on second and subsequent low-priority
    reconfigures, though.)

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu11) dapper; urgency=low

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu10) dapper; urgency=low

  * Remove xserver-xorg-driver-v4l and xserver-xorg-driver-glide from the
    Depends field of xserver-xorg-driver-all
  * Remove xserver-xorg-input-wacom from the Depends field of
    xserver-xorg-input-all
  * Add zlib1g-dev to the dependency list of xlibs-dev and remove
    xlibs-static-dev, since the latter no longer exists.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 16:39:24 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu8) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add xserver-xorg-driver-sisusb to amd64, i386 and powerpc; add
    -driver-voodoo to amd64 and i386.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 15:27:03 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Change xserver-xorg's dependency on x-common to x11-common.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 01:39:58 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu5) dapper; urgency=low

  * Also check that /usr/bin/X11 isn't a symlink, since -d covers both
    directories, and symlinks to directories.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 00:00:58 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Clean debian/local/X instead of debian/local/xserver-wrapper, and make
    x11-common Arch: any instead of all.  I am clever.  (closes: Malone#28967)

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 23:00:03 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Perform x-common-esque symlink<->dir transitions in x11-common; add
    Conflicts on x-common.
  * Trim default set of input drivers down to evdev, keyboard, mouse, wacom.
  * Rejig handling of x-window-system-core depends.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 17:06:53 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add laptop-detect dependency to x11-common, make preinst slightly more,
    er, robust, in the face of failure (closes: Malone#28911).
  * Add dependencies in laptop-detect, xresprobe, mdetect and discover1 to
    xserver-xorg.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 08:33:23 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * This package now only provides metapackages; we're now modular for real
    real, not for play play.
  * The xlibs, xlibs-data, xlibs-static-dev, xlibs-static-pic, xbase-clients,
    xutils, and x-window-system-dev packages have been removed.  xlibs-dev
    remains.  For now.
  * Merge xserver-common and xorg-common packages into x11-common.
  * Rewrite keyboard detection list to work off d-i keymap only, not language
    too.
  * Drop support for upgrades from pre-sarge, remove support for
    XORG_FORCE_PROBE environment variable.  Remove support for
    non-multiplexed mice in dexconf.
  * Prune unneeded bits of shell-lib.sh (which turns out to be most of it).
  * Move xserver-xorg.config.in detection bits into .postinst.in, so it all
    happens in the one place, and we can use the X server to configure itself
    by detecting its own driver if need be.
  * Move all previous changelog entries to changelog.Debian.old.
  * neomagic is also special, in terms of mode validation on laptops
    (closes: Ubuntu#18957).
  * Move update-linux-hardened-support call from xserver-xorg postinst to
    xserver-xorg-core.
  * Move md5sum/roster directory to /var/lib/x11 from /var/lib/xfree86, and
    use /usr/bin/Xorg, instead of /usr/bin/X11/Xorg.
  * I don't think the following:
     Users of SGI Indigo2 XL machines, or machines with other buses not yet
     fully supported, should specify simply "1" here.  (This is not
     guaranteed to work.)
     was really necessary to have in a Debconf note, so let's remove it.
  * Get rid of write_dri_section question, and just always write it.
  * Replace $NOPROBE with $AUTODETECT_VIDEO, and $DOPROBE with $UPGRADE,
    inverting the senses of both variables.
  * Remove support for DEBUG_XFREE86_* variables (has been DEBUG_XORG_* for a
    while now).
  * Remove compatibility code for xresprobe < 0.4.13.
  * Remove long-unused 'are you on an LCD?' question.
  * Don't touch the config file when we're upgrading.  Specific migrations
    needed can be done in-place.
  * Add seconds to the backup xorg.conf file's name, so you can do multiple
    reconfigures in the same minute.
  * Remove language -> keymap 'smarts'.
  * Make xserver-xorg depend on either the full set of drivers
    (xserver-xorg-driver-all, xserver-xorg-input-all), or any individual
    driver (xserver-xorg-driver, xserver-xorg-input).
  * Remove all dependencies on -driver-atimisc, as it is part of -ati.
  * Nuke irrelevant history section and segue into xf86cfg description from
    dexconf's manpage, update XF86Config-4 references to talk about xorg.conf
    instead.
  * Remove code which checked if a given directory didn't exist ... right
    after it ensured it had been created.
  * Change default mouse protocol to ExplorerPS/2 (closes: Ubuntu#4106).
  * Remove support in dexconf for CID fonts, since mkcfm is wildly non-free.
  * Remove support for ZAxisMapping.
  * Ensure GLcore is removed from the module list when upgrading.
  * Remove XFree86 history spiel from x11-common description.
  * Add /usr/X11R6/bin/X -> /usr/bin/X link.
  * Ask the 'which server?' question at priority low.
  * Remove hppa's hardcoded null _INPUT_DEPENDS, as the libdl-based loader has
    dragged the rest of this architecture kicking and screaming into 1983.
    Unfortunately LaMont is still stuck in 1975, but you can't expect me to
    fix that.
