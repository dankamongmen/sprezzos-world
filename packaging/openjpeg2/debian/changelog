 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Mon, 09 Mar 2009 16:59:02 +0100

openjpeg (1.3+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix FTBFS on alpha. Modify codec/dirent.h to not generate error if __linux__
    is defined as well as __alpha__. (Closes: #483048)

 -- Robin Cornelius <robin.cornelius@gmail.com>  Sun, 08 Jun 2008 06:48:24 +0200

openjpeg (1.3+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

    mipsel buildds) by using chmod in a better way, recursively removing
    -x and adding +X, so that sufficient permissions remain.

     - Add myself to Uploaders.

openjpeg (1.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Remove leftover codec/{image_to_j2k, j2k_to_image} in the clean
    target (fix double-build failure)
  * Indent list in the long description (per lintian)
  * Replace XS-Vcs-{Svn, Browser} with Vcs-{Git, Browser}
  * Nuke trailing whitespaces.
  * Rephrase descriptions.
  * Remove remaining trailing whitespaces.
  * Use “$(MAKE) dist” instead of “make dist”.
  * Move .PHONY and .SUFFIXES to the bottom.
  * Use an include of dpatch.make instead of defining the rules
    manually.
  * Remove unneeded get-orig-source target and the mode line.
  * Try and adjust permissions during “clean” since upstream ships
    everything with a+x.
  * Rename manpages to build-manpages, adjust .PHONY.
  * Remove extra (no longer needed with recent dpkg-dev versions) -L and
    -l flags from dh_shlibdeps.
  * Nuke trailing whitespaces in copyright file.
  * Document in debian/TODO that the hardcoded shared object symlinks is a
    target for further uploads.

  [ Robin Cornelius ]
  * Build codec tools against system libtiff headers.
  * Remove non-dfsg files from package and edit copyright and README.Debian to
    document changes and removals.
  * Tidy up control file package descriptions and use soname in -dbg
    package
  * Do not keep upstream source in our git tree. We should use a get-
    orig-source
  * Apply Cyril Brulebois' suggestion for watchfile regex.
  * Update debian/rules. Note get-orig-source needs further work.
  * Change maintainer address to be the group address.
  * Fix build warning, add final new line to debian/watch.
  * Fix lintian warnings due to different email address in changelog and
    Uploaders:
  * In debian/rules clean target, use dh_clean to remove all files,
    don't use rm
  * Update debian/copyright as I have made changes in 2008.
  * Switch from txt2man to perlpod:
     - txt2man is buggy and generates incorrectly formatted man pages
       (#416391).
     - Remove it from Build-Depends.
     - Use perlpod manpages (debian/*.pod).
     - Generate manpages during the build through pod2man.
     - Delete them through dh_clean.

    - Update debian/rules to match upstream changes to makefile.
    - Stop ignoring make errors and rm errors in debian/rules.

      not static library.
    - Remove linkage against unused libs and add linkage against missing libs
      (via dpatch).
    - Change debian/copyright to take advantage of proposed format and ensure
      all authors and licences are listed.
