Description: Framework for creating shell environments
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.

 Shellac is a framework for building read-eval-print style shells. Shells
 are created by declaratively defining a set of shell commands and an
 evaluation function. Shellac supports multiple shell backends, including
 a basic backend which uses only Haskell IO primitives and a full featured
 readline backend based on the Haskell readline bindings found in the
 standard libraries. This library attempts to allow users to write shells
 at a high level and still enjoy the advanced features that may be available
 from a powerful line editing package like readline.
