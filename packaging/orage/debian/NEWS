orage (4.5.12.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The location where Orage stores its ICS calendar files has moved to
    ~/.local/share/orage. If you're upgrading from an earlier version of
    orage, don't panic when all your appointments seem to be lost, you can
    import them into the new version! Just make sure to quit orage and run the
    command "mv ~/.config/xfce4/orage/*ics ~/.local/share/orage" (without the
    double-quotes) on the command line prompt. Start orage again and your
    appointments are back again.
