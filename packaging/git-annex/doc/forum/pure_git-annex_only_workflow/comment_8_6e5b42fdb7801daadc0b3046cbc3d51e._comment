I don't mind changing the behavior of git-annex sync, certianly..

Looking thru git's documentation, I found some existing configuration that could be reused following your idea.
There is a remote.name.skipDefaultUpdate and a remote.name.skipFetchAll. Though both have to do with fetches, not pushes.
Another approach might be to use git's remote group stuff.
