Description: simple reflection of expressions containing variables
 This package allows simple reflection of expressions containing variables.
 Reflection here means that a Haskell expression is turned into a string.
 .
 The primary aim of this package is teaching and understanding;
 there are no options for manipulating the reflected expressions beyond
 showing them.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
