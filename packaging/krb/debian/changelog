krb5 (1.8.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream release; only change is version bump from beta1 to final 
  * Bring back a libkrb53 oldlibs package. Note that this is technically a
    policy violation because it doesn't provide libdes425.so.3 or
    libkrb4.so.2 and thus provides a different ABI. However, some
    packages, such as postgres8.4 require the lenny version to be present
    for the squeeze transition, so we cannot force the removal of
    libkrb53's reverse dependencies. We can conflict or break with lenny
    packages that will not work with this libkrb53, but we may break
    out-of-archive packages without notice. Absent someone coming up with
    a patch to the modern libk5crypto-3 that allows it to work with the
    lenny libkrb53 (a weekend's worth of work proved this would be quite
    difficult), this is the best solution we've come up with, Closes: #596678

krb5 (1.8.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
  * Fixes significant ABI incompatibility between Heimdal and MIT in the
    init_creds_step API; backward incompatible change in the meaning of
    the flags API.  Since this was introduced in 1.8 and since no better
    solution was found, it's felt that getting 1.8.1 out everywhere that
    had 1.8 very promptly is the right approach.  Otherwise software build
    against 1.8 will be broken in the future.
  * Testing of Kerberos 1.8 showed an incompatibility between Heimdal/MIT
    Kerberos and Microsoft Kerberos; resolve this incompatibility.  As a
    result, mixing KDCs between 1.8 and 1.8.1 in the same realm may
    produce undesirable results for constrained delegation.  Again,
    another reason to replace 1.8 with 1.8.1 as soon as possible.

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Change libkrb5-dbg to only depend on libkrb5-3, libk5crypto3, or

    debugging symbols also depend on one of those packages and always
    will, so listing the disjunction of every library package is

krb5 (1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-8) experimental; urgency=low

  * Re-introduce libkrb53 and libkadm55 based on discussion on
    debian-devel; in this version, libkrb53 contains only libkrb4.  Both
    libkrb53 and libkadm55 depend on  the split library packages.  These
    dependencies are unversioned; that means that before any symbols are
    added the shlibs files need to be repointed away from libkrb53 and
    libkadm55.  Any version of the split library packages can satisfy the
    symbols needed by the libraries previously shipped in libkrb53.
  * Perform two builds; one without krb4 and one with krb4 for the only
    warnings; they will go away when the shlibs files are repointed.
  * Remove krb4 support from  debconf and init scripts.
  * Remove the krb4 migration guide from doc-base
  * Fix up replaces in control file so that libraries that used to be in
    libkadm55 claim to replace libkadm55 
  * Only use parallel builds on the krb5 build; it breaks krb4  enabled
    builds. 
  * Used versioned replaces; this seems to make it harder to get a system
    into a broken state if you remove the new packages, Closes: #517483

  * Do not build krb4 support; this is being removed upstream with 1.7 and
    it is strongly desirable to  examine the debian implications.
  * As a result, the libraries which were previously all in libkrb53 need
    to change package names as we are dropping some libraries.  So, split
    out the libraries into lib<libraryname>-<soname> per policy.  The old
    format was consistent with policy when it was written 8 years ago, and
    has lasted well.  As a result, a significant number of new library
    packages are introduced.
  * Use dpkg-gensymbols support for .symbols files for better version tracking

  * krb5_klog_syslog has a trivial buffer overflow that can be exploited
    by network data; CVE-2007-0957.  The upstream patch is very intrusive
    because it fixes each call to syslog to have proper length checking as
    well as the actual krb5_klog_syslog internals to use vsnprintf rather
    than vsprintf.  I have chosen to only include the change to
    krb5_klog_syslog for sarge.  This is sufficient to fix the problem but
    is much smaller and less intrusive.   (MIT-SA-2007-2)
  * MIT-SA-2007-3: The GSS-API library can cause a double free if
    applications treat certain errors decoding a message as errors that
    require freeing the output buffer.  At least the gssapi rpc library
    does this, so kadmind is vulnerable.    Fix the gssapi library because

    This change will break  clients between 1.3 beta1 and 1.3-1 talking to
    1.3-2 KDCs, but is necessary because of a protocol bug.

  * New upstream version--finally 1.3 is released, Closes: #199573
  * Don't depend on com_err in libcrypto, Closes: #201005
  * Urgency is medium because the only code change is removing a single
    call to com_err and this package not being in testing is blocking
    other packages.  The beta has been in unstable more than 10 days.
  * Update shlibs again to avoid long-term references to a beta in the archive

krb5 (1.2.7-3) unstable; urgency=high

  *  Patch for CERT VU#623217 and VU#442569: Cryptographic weaknesses in
    Kerberos 4
      - Add -X option to krb5kdc and krb524d.  By default  cross-realm is
    no longer supported for krb4 as it is a security hole.
      - Add protection to isolate krb5 keys from krb4 especially for the
    TGS key
     - Remove support for the MIT extension to krb4 to use 3DES keys as it
    is insecure.
  * Patch to various DOS issues where the KDC assumes principal names have
    certain components.  Fixes CAN-2003-0072 
  *  VU#516825: Additional errors in XDR that may lead to denial of

    krb5kdc  so it actually works, Closes: #174881

  * Fix readme.debian comments to be correct

 -- Sam Hartman <hartmans@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Oct 2002 17:18:41 -0400

krb5 (1.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Important: upstream has introduced a new way of handling AFS tickets
    within krb524d; long-term this may allow the use of ticket keys other
    than DES with AFS, but short-term this will break AFS because OpenAFS
    has not yet released servers that support the new mechanism.  If you
    run AFS servers and don't want them to break, please look at README.debian
  * This includes a fix for 162794 as that is now in the upstream
  * For now, libkrb5-dev is going to be priority extra.  If anyone
    complains I'll attempt to fight the comerr-dev dependency battle;
    honestly I think comerr-dev is common enough and on enough systems
    that it rates optional but the maintainer does not, Closes: #145165
  * Fix restart to restart krb524d, Closes: #162477

krb5 (1.2.5-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * We are still installing a krb5.conf.template; don't as that is
    kerberos-configs's job. 
  * The MIT KDC was not sending etype info padata; this couldcreate a
    problem  if you require preauth and have unusual salts; patch from
    upstream CVS
    * Add readme to krb5-user, Closes: #152670
  * Fix typo in alternatives handling so man page symlinks are handled
    correctely, Closes: #152707

  * Pull up bugfix from 1.2.5 beta1  to src/lib/krb5/asn.1/asn1_get.c

    1.2.5 changes besides the API reorg.  I'm not checking an API reorg
    this close to woody release.

krb5 (1.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * We want to be able to use krb4 and libssl's libcrypto in the same

  * Update config.guess and config.sub, closes: #97585
  * Have telnetd depend on krb5-rsh-server.  I suspect this will make
