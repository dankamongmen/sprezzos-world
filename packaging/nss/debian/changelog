nss (2:3.13.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control, debian/libnss3*, debian/rules,
    mozilla/security/coreconf/*, mozilla/security/nss/lib/*/manifest.mn:
    Move to unversioned library. ABI compatibility is ensured upstream, and
    the SO version, if it needed a change at any time, would be a change in
    the library name. There is no reason to keep making compatibility more
    difficult with other distros and upstream binary releases. While previous
    versions were one-way compatible (binaries built against other distros or
    upstream nspr could work on Debian), this approach works both ways.
  * debian/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.0. No changes required.
    - Force to build against libnspr4-dev >= 2:4.9
  * Removed unapplied patches.
  * Adding an epoch to match the old libnss3 package that used to be in
    the Debian archive.

nss (3.12.0~1.9b1-2) unstable; urgency=low

    as it overwrites so of its files. Closes: #455875.

    loader_GetOriginalPathname, so that symlinks are properly followed when
    determining where the current library lives.

  * debian/control:

    + Make libnss3-1d conflict with older libnss3-0d.
  * debian/patches/38_kbsd.dpatch, debian/patches/81_sonames.dpatch:
    Adapted to upstream changes.

    + Remove SO version from libsoftokn3, now it is not linked against

      handle the SO version in the file name.

    + For some reason, build-stamp was missing in install-stamp dependencies.
    + Bumped shlibs because of new symbols, and pass -c4 to dpkg-gensymbols,
      so that it fails in all cases where the symbols file is not up to date.
    + Adapt upstream version pattern matching so that the ~1.9b1 part is
      removed.
    + Install .1d libraries in -1d packages.

      package.
