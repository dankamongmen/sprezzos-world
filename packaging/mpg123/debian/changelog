mpg123 (1.7.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/alt_deps.py: Add helper code to fold several (plugin)
    dependencies into a single alternative dependency. Used to
    auto-generate the default Recommends for "first-class" output
    plugins. Unlike the previous hack in debian/rules, the helper

    build errors on several archs where plugins picked out a different
    versioned dependency on libc6 than the rest of the packages.
    Closes: #524246

  * src/libmpg123/id3.c: Apply upstream fix for out-of-bounds error in
    id3 parser.
  * debian/mpg123.postinst: Output auto-detection is no good as long as

    priority. Remove alternative setting for all wrapper scripts, therefore.
    Closes: #391669
  * debian/mpg123-wrapper.in: Call mpg123 binary with exec to avoid stray

      plugin mechanism.
    + Fixed parsing of ICY streams. Closes: #449319
  * debian/*: Major packaging overhaul.
    + Output-specific packages are turned into dummy packages as plugins in
      the main package mpg123 now provide all the required funtionality.
    + In a default installation, dependencies for the ALSA and OSS output
      plugins are pulled in via Recommends. Dependencies for the other
      output plugins are provided in Suggests. Closes: #391669
    + A package with i486-specific optimisations is no longer built. Instead,
      a dummy package will pull in the main package mpg123 providing generic
      optimisations.
    + As different output backends and CPU optimisations used to be accessible
      through separate binaries, wrapper skripts are provided using the old
      names. These wrappers are likely to be removed in the next release
      cycle, though.

    3dnow version is only needed for upgrades and can stay linux-i386-only.
  * debian/postinst.in: Increase priorities by 100 for mpg123 alternative to

  * Finally understood why size calculation of audio fragments broke
    PPC support--we're actually violating OSS v1.1 specs, and PPC's
    dmasound driver traps it.  Reverted previous workaround and added
    proper fix.
  * common.h: Increase MAXFRAMESIZE to 3456 bytes, which is much closer to
    reality.
  * common.c: Add a sanity check on framesize overflow. Cannot happen now,
    but let's be prepared.

  * The "my patch is bigger than yours" release.
  * When playing the _first_ song in buffered mode, wait until the buffer
    is completely filled up before any output is produced.  The threshold
    remains at 1/8 the buffer for all the later songs.  This hack gives
    live streams a chance to fill up the whole buffer. Closes: #34844
  * Clarify documentation of random play options. Closes: #131105
  * Initialise output early to prevent segfault on zero length files.
    Closes: #97899
  * Applied slightly modified version of patch from Andreas Dilger
    <adilger@turbolinux.com> to recognize ID3 tags.
    Closes: #72372, #81260, #105329

    point arithmetic on arm. Closes: #72600
  * Applied patch from Chris Butler <chrisb@debian.org> to fix size
    calculation of OSS audio fragments.  Added a hack to make the patch
    work on PPC. (WTF? Might be a bug in PPC's OSS implementation.)
    Closes: #79566
  * Shuffled includes in audio_oss.c to avoid redefinition of native
    endian formats.
  * Applied patch from Andreas Dilger <adilger@turbolinux.com> to skip
    over unplayable files during shuffle play. Closes: #60726
  * Applied patch from Martin Sjögren <md9ms@mdstud.chalmers.se> to
