  * The "I'm back" release. (Closes: #533229)
  * New upstream release. To prevent some strange behaviours from
    bzr bd or dpkg-buildpackage, I've changed the way of versioning this
    package, will use "." now instead of the old "-". (Closes: #501900)
  * debian/patches/cve-security-fix.dpatch: added to re-apply NMU changes
    regarding a security fix. (take a look at bug #530255 about this)
  * debian/patches/FTBFS-fix.dpatch: added to prevent a FTBFS after applying
    cve-security-fix patch. (which contains NMU changes)
  * debian/control:
    - Changed my mail address. (Closes: #533820)
    - changed homepage setting it to the right project. Plus changed 
      and set the "See also" website to the old and discontinued project,
      which is no more active. (http://ctorrent.sf.net) (Closes: #501899)
    - Removed docbook-to-man dep, we have a ctorrent.1 file ready to go.
    - Bumped Standards-version to the latest 3.8.2
    - libssl-dev removed, it's no more needed now.
    - added a dep on dpatch

    file. (Closes: #501893)
  * debian/ctorrent.1: added, thanks to Jari Aalto for the patch. 
  * debian/rules: 
    - fixed path to ctorrent.1, now dh_installman will be
      able to find ctorrent.1 again and install it on the right place.
    - added a better clean rule to prevent lintian complaining.
    - added a --with-ssl=no rule to the configure run, so ctorrent won't
      depend on openssl preventing a copyright issue.
    - added dpatch support
