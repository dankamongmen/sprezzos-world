Description: emulates an AirPort Express (development files)
 This program emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of
 streaming music from iTunes and compatible iPods. It implements
 a server for the Apple RAOP protocol. ShairPort does not support
 AirPlay v2 (video and photo streaming). It supports multiple
 simultaneous streams, if your audio output chain
 (as detected by libao) does so.
