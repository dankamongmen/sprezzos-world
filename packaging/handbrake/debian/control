Description: versatile DVD ripper and video transcoder (command line)
 HandBrake is a versatile, easy-to-use tool for converting DVDs and other
 videos into H.264, XViD, or OGG formatted media.  It's particularly useful
 for making videos that are compatible with portable video devices such as
 the Apple iPod/iPhone or Sony PSP.

 This version of handbrake has been modified for inclusion in Debian.
 It does neither support audio encoding to AAC via faac nor MP4 format
 muxing via libmp4v2, it falls back to the MKV format instead.
