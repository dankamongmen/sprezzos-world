audiofile (0.2.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implements afOpenVirtualFile(), so applications can actually make
    use of the API exposed in af_vfs.h. (Kudos to Daniel Schepler
    <schepler@math.berkeley.edu>.)
  * Include shlibs dependency on this version and up.  That's because
    the above amounts to an API change, or rather an API fix.  Previous
    versions declared the function in the headers, but didn't implement
    a stub in the lib itself.  Same with some of the changes between
    0.1.9, and 0.2.0, so it's really high time we add a shlibs version.
