alsa-lib (1.0.25-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Remove trailing whitespace character from the end of the
      DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH definition, as it was breaking the plugin
      directory path.
  * Mark libasound2-dev Multi-Arch: same (closes: #666763).
  * Enable hardening flags, using a patch from Simon Ruderich,
    (closes: #662685).
  * Build-Depend on dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1) for buildflags.mk usage.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3, no changes needed.

alsa-lib (1.0.25-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Stop Build-Depending on libcxxtools-dev. Why we were doing this is a
    mystery.
  * Put the bi-arch horror on a diet: remove all lib64* stuff, and support
    lib32* for amd64 only (there's no point in supporting ppc64 in light
    of Multiarch). Simplify debian/rules bi-arch bits assuming the install
    dir is /usr/lib32 and doing no other calculations.
  * Handle installation of bi-arch files with .install files.
  * Use sed -i to modify bi-arch build Makefile.
  * Use dh_installdocs to install Doxygen documentation.
  * Stop suggesting lib32asound2-plugins, as it's going away.
  * Continue digging through lists of symbols of previous alsa-lib
    releases. libasound2.symbols is now based on 1.0.16, the version released
    with lenny.
  * Bump debhelper to version 9.

alsa-lib (1.0.25-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Update debian/changelog.ALSA.
  * Run source package through wrap-and-sort.
  * Edit add-maintainer-mode.patch to use AM_MAINTAINER_MODE([enable]).
  * Drop lp178442-ICE1712.patch (stolen from Git).
  * Drop pulseaudio_configuration.patch. PulseAudio should instead use
    the new alsa.conf.d directory to load the ALSA pulse config.
  * Drop relibtoolise.patch. Instead, Build-Depend on dh-autoreconf and
    adjust rules to use it.
  * Drop configure_cross_compile.patch, as it's apparently not needed
    anymore, and dh_autoreconf makes it unusable.
  * Don't configure with --enable-static anymore, as it breaks the build
    and it was useless anyway.
  * Don't try to install .a files that aren't built anymore.
  * Add a libasound2.symbols file, for now based on 1.0.23. Thanks
    Julien Cristau for the help to get this in shape.
  * Adapt call to dh_makeshlibs to stop using -V and use -c4 for
    dpkg-gensymbols, but leave biarch packages using -V.
  * Stop installing libasound2 and libasound2-udeb stuff by hand, use
    .install files instead. Drop obsolete .dirs files.
  * Let libasound2-doc depend on libjs-jquery, and replace the included
    copy of jquery.js with a symlink (lintian).
  * Add spelling_fixes.patch with the sole intention of getting lintian to
    shut up.
  * Remove Mikael Magnusson from Uploaders.
  * Use watch file version 3, and don't uupdate.
  * Update Vcs-* URLs.

    its presence causes a dependency loop introduced with the Multiarch
    changes (closes: #635568).

    - Declare DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH and use it to define $libdir.
    - Add an explicit --with-plugindir argument to base plugindir on the
      multiarch dir.
    - Update libasound2-dev.install.
    - Mark libasound2 Multi-Arch: same.
  * Break current versions of packages providing ALSA plugins.
  * Remove libasound2's .la file, as any reference will be now broken.

    (closes: #613092)

  [ Jordi Mallach ]
  * Add -DHAVE_USELOCALE to CFLAGS (really closes: #595252). The correct
    fix would be to autoreconf entirely, but the mess of patches is bad
    enough already and this should be done better in the future when we
    go multiarch and we can cleanup debian/rules from the biarch horror.

    (Closes: #589896, LP: #552411, #584393)
  * Add libtool-out-of-tree.patch: fix libtool version checking for the biarch

    force -DUSE_VERSIONED_SYMBOLS for the biarch build
