Description: a macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

Description: X Athena widget set library
 Xaw is a widget set based on the the Xt (X Toolkit Intrinsics) library.  It
 provides a set of graphical user-interface elements ("widgets") such as
 menus, scrollbars, dialog boxes, text-input areas, and so forth.  The X
 clients distributed with the X Window System itself, as well as many others,
 use the Athena widget set.
 .
 XFree86 has made a number of major improvements to the Athena widget set,
 resulting in version 7 -- this version features widgets customizable in
 appearance and event handling (a.k.a. "themes"); an extensible image loader
 (currently supports bitmaps, gradients, and pixmaps); numerous enhancements
 to the Text widget, text source and text sink objects; and multiple-column
 support in the SimpleMenu widget.
 .
 The older Athena widget library corresponding to version X11R6.4 of the X
 Window System can be found in the libxaw6 package.

Description: a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains all the components necessary to turn your
 Debian GNU/Linux box into a powerful file and printer server.
 .
 Currently, the Samba Debian packages consist of the following:
 .
  samba - LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix.
  samba-common - Samba common files used by both the server and the client.
  smbclient - LanManager-like simple client for Unix.
  swat - Samba Web Administration Tool
  samba-doc - Samba documentation.
  smbfs - Mount and umount commands for the smbfs (kernels 2.2.x and above).
  libpam-smbpass - pluggable authentication module for SMB password database
  libsmbclient - Shared library that allows applications to talk to SMB servers
  libsmbclient-dev - libsmbclient shared libraries
  winbind: Service to resolve user and group information from Windows NT servers
  python2.3-samba: Python bindings that allow access to various aspects of Samba
 .
 It is possible to install a subset of these packages depending on
 your particular needs. For example, to access other SMB servers you
 should only need the smbclient and samba-common packages.

 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

Description: aRts Sound system
 aRts is a short form for "analog realtime synthesizer". The idea of the whole
 thing is to create/process sound using small modules which do certain tasks.
 These may be create a waveform (oscillators), play samples, filter data, add
 signals, perform effects like delay/flanger/chorus, or output the data to
 the soundcard.
 .
 aRts is the core sound system for KDE (and other systems)
 .
 This package is part of the official KDE aRts module.

 program to parse that grammar.  Once you are proficient with Bison, you
 may use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used
 in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.
 .
 Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc
 grammars ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone familiar with
 Yacc should be able to use Bison with little trouble.

Description: Runtime files for the OpenEXR image library
 OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
 Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
 .
 OpenEXR's features include:
    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and
      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.
 This package contains the following shared libraries:
    * IlmImf - a library that reads and writes OpenEXR images.
    * Imath - a math library with support for matrices, 2D and
      3D transformations, solvers for linear/quadratic/cubic
      equations, and more.

Description: Smart Modem getty replacement
 Mgetty is a versatile program to handle all aspects of a modem under Unix.
 .
 The program 'mgetty' allows you to use a modem for handling external
 logins, receiving faxes and using the modem as a answering machine without
 interfering with outgoing calls.
 .
 This package includes basic modem data capabilities. Install mgetty-fax to
 get the additional functionality for fax. Install mgetty-voice to get the
 functionality to operate voice modems.
 .
 Mgetty is also configurable to select programs other than login for special
 connections (eg: uucico, fido or other programs) depending on the login
 userid. It also supports caller-id if the modem and phone line supply it,
 and can deny connections based on originating telephone number.

Description: Programs to send and receive fax messages
 efax is a small ANSI C/POSIX program that provides the data transport
 function for fax applications using any Class 1 or Class 2 fax modem.
 Another program, efix, converts between fax, text, bit-map and gray-scale
 formats. fax, a shell script, provides a simple user interface to the efax
 and efix programs. It allows you to send text or Postscript files as faxes
 and receive, print or preview received faxes.
 .
 The ghostscript package is needed to fax Postscript files, and a image
 viewing program as xloadimage is need to view incoming faxes.
 .
 Note that you probably have to adapt /etc/efax.rc to your needs.

Description: Guess PC disk partition table, find lost partitions
 Gpart is a tool which tries to guess the primary partition table of a
 PC-type disk in case the primary partition table in sector 0 is
 damaged, incorrect or deleted.
 .
 It is also good at finding and listing the types, locations, and
 sizes of inadvertently-deleted partitions, both primary and logical.
 It gives you the information you need to manually re-create them
 (using fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk, etc.).
 .
 The guessed table can also be written to a file or (if you firmly
 believe the guessed table is entirely correct) directly to a disk
 device.
 .
 Supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types:
 .
  * BeOS filesystem type.
  * FreeBSD/NetBSD/386BSD disklabel sub-partitioning
    scheme used on Intel platforms.
  * Linux second extended filesystem.
  * MS-DOS FAT12/16/32 "filesystems".
  * IBM OS/2 High Performance filesystem.
  * Linux LVM physical volumes (LVM by Heinz Mauelshagen).
  * Linux swap partitions (versions 0 and 1).
  * The Minix operating system filesystem type.
  * MS Windows NT/2000 filesystem.
  * QNX 4.x filesystem.
  * The Reiser filesystem (version 3.5.X, X > 11).
  * Sun Solaris on Intel platforms uses a sub-partitioning
    scheme on PC hard disks similar to the BSD disklabels.
  * Silicon Graphics' journalling filesystem for Linux.

 mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
 invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
 now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
 are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge
 about what it means to be a screensaver.

Description: The Hermes pixel-format library
 Hermes is a library that does the dirty work of a graphics library
 or application that nobody else wants to do, and it does it fast
 because the effort is concentrated on just that. The thing nobody
 wants to do is conversion between pixel formats - between all pixel
 formats that is, not between any two. There are handwritten assembler
 routines in Hermes that should make anything look fast.
 .
 An application or library that uses Hermes will for example be able to
 render into one buffer and convert it to whatever pixel format is available
 on the target platform at the time.
 .
 Other services provided by Hermes include palette handling including
 caching of lookup tables, and surface clearing to a specific colour value.
 .

 managers.  Its final goal is to produce a window manager that doesn't require
 editing of configuration files.  Window Maker is fast and doesn't require tons
 of memory to run.

Description: Heavy duty browser for mail folders
 Buffy is a program that displays a compact summary of your mail folders, and
 allows to invoke a command (usually a mail reader) on them.  It is written
 with the intent of being a handy everyday tool for people handling large
 volumes of mail.  For mutt users, this can be a nice front-end to supplement
 the simple built-in folder browser when one has many folders to keep track of.
 .
 Buffy tries hard to work out of the box: it looks for mail folders in sensible
 places and comes with reasonable defaults.
 .
 The program is functional but still very young, and only Maildir folders are
 supported at the moment.

Description: Add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the adduser and deluser commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
 o Adduser can create new users and groups and add existing users to
   existing groups.
 o Deluser can remove users and groups and remove users from a given
   group.
 .
 Adding users with adduser is much easier than adding them by hand.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, allow you to set an
 initial password and the GECOS field.
 .
 Deluser can optionally remove and backup the user's home directory
 and mail spool or all files on the system owned by him.
 .
 Optionally a custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .
 Adduser is maintained on http://alioth.debian.org/projects/adduser/.
 There is also a development mailing list on
 http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/adduser-devel/.

 Ispell corrects spelling in plain text, LaTeX, sgml/html/xml,

 ispell, and ispell works from many other tools and from the
 command line as well.
 .
 No ispell dictionaries are included in this package; you must install
 at least one of them ("iamerican" is the default dependency for no
 good reason); install the "ispell-dictionary" package(s) for the
 lanuguage(s) you and your users will want to spell-check.
 .
 It's a good idea to install "wordlist" package(s) for the same
 language(s), because they'll be used by ispell's (L)ookup command.

 in reverse (for example, 2.0.0.127 would be the IP address 127.0.0.2),
 and "domain.name.com" is the base domain name of the filtering service.

 libdebtags provides functionality to search and categorize debian packages
 using the Debtags and APT databases.  Functions provided:
 .
  * search packages by normal debian/control fields and package tags
  * find packages related to a given one
  * edit debtags package categorization, with undo support
  * save and submit tag patches to the central tag archive
 .
 libdebtags is written with the intent to make it easy and efficient for
 applications to include debtags support.
 .
 Warning: the API has not yet been stabilized and is subject to change in
 future versions.

Description: Dictionary Server
 dictd is a TCP based server that allows a client to access dictionary
 definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases.
 .
 Many dictionary databases have been packaged for debian.  They are
 discussed in more detail in the file
 /usr/doc/dictd/README.Debian.gz
 .
 Either dict-gcide or dict-wn is essential for a useful English
 language dictionary server.  It is strongly recommended that both be
 installed.  If you are interested in computer terminology, it is
 recommended that one or more of dict-jargon, dict-foldoc, and
 dict-vera also be installed.
 .
 The client program, dict, is packaged in dict*.deb  If you are
 running a server, you will want the client for all machines in your
 network, and for testing server operations.

Description: turns other processes into daemons
 There are many tasks that need to be performed to correctly set up a
 daemon process. This can be tedious. Daemon performs these tasks for
 other processes. This is useful for writing daemons in languages other
 than C, C++ or Perl (e.g. /bin/sh, Java).
 .
 If you want to write daemons in languages that can link against C functions
 (e.g. C, C++), see libslack which contains the core functionality of daemon.

 have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input
 files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).  Less uses
 termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of
 terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.

Description: X Window System utility programs
 xutils provides a set of utility programs shipped with the X Window System
 that do not require the X libraries; many of these programs are useful
 even on a system that does not have any X clients or X servers installed.
 .
 The programs in this package include:
  - bdftopcf, which converts BDF fonts to PCF fonts;
  - bdftruncate and ucs2any, tools to generate fonts with various encodings
    from ISO 10646-encoded fonts
  - ccmakedep, a version of makedepend which "does it right"
  - cleanlinks, a program to remove dangling symlinks and empty directories
    from a shadow link tree (created with lndir)
  - fslsfonts, a tool that lists fonts served by an X font server;
  - imake, a C preprocessor interface to the make utility;
  - lndir, a tool that creates a shadow directory of symbolic links to
    another directory tree;
  - luit, a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
    UTF-8 terminal emulator;
  - makedepend, a tool to create dependencies in makefiles;
  - makeg, a tool for making debuggable executables;
  - makepsres, a tool that creates PostScript language resource database
    files;
  - makestrs, a tool that makes string table C source and header(s);
  - mkcfm, a tool that create summaries of font metric files in CID font
    directories;
  - mkdirhier, a tool that creates a directory hierarchy;
  - mkfontdir, a program to generate fonts.dir files;
  - scanpci, a utility for retrieving information about the PCI bus and
    devices on it (not available on all architectures);
  - pcitweak, a utility that can be used to examine or change registers in
    the PCI configuration space (not available on all architectures);
  - pswrap, a tool that creates C procedures from segments of PostScript
    language code;
  - resize, which prints a shell command for setting the TERM and TERMCAP
    environment variables to indicate the current size of the xterm (or
    compatible program) window from which the command is run;
  - revpath, which generates a relative path that can be used to undo a
    change-directory;
  - rstart, a remote start client;
  - rstartd, a remote start daemon activated by rstart connections;
  - sessreg, a simple program for managing utmp/wtmp entries;
  - showfont, a font dumper for use with an X font server;
  - showrgb, a decompiler for RGB color-name databases;
  - xfsinfo, an X font server information utility;
  - xmkmf, a tool that creates a Makefile from an Imakefile; and
  - xon, a tool that starts an X program on a remote machine.
 .
 Installation of an rsh or ssh daemon (server) is necessary if rstartd is
 to be used, and installation of an rsh or ssh client is necessary if
 rstart is to be used.  The luit program requires locale information from
 the xlibs-data package.
 .
 imake uses the C preprocessor (cpp) as a macro processor.  The GNU C
 preprocessor's "-traditional" support misbehaves in early releases of the GCC
 3.3 series; therefore, this package conflicts with those versions.

 .
 The program is simple, but powerful -- people can create new modules,
 called "bundles", that add new things to the program that its original
 developers did not think of or even intend -- that don't require
 recompiling the main program.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web
 using http and ftp, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp
 sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp
 retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: Reports bugs in the Debian distribution
 reportbug is a tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian
 and derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:
 .
  * Integration with the mutt, af, and mh/nmh mail readers.
  * Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
    whether problems have already been reported.
  * Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
  * Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
  * Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
  * Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.
 .
 reportbug is designed to be used on systems with an installed mail
 transport agent, like exim or sendmail; however, you can edit the
 configuration file and send reports using any available mail server.
 .
 If your system's users use locales with character sets other than
 UTF-8 and ISO-8859-*, one of either python2.3-cjkcodecs or
 python2.3-iconvcodec is required for proper operation.  For Asian
 locales, the use of python2.3-cjkcodecs is preferred over the more
 limited python2.3-iconvcodec.

Description: A fast lexical analyzer generator.
 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.
 .
 The behaviour of Flex has undergone a major change since version
 2.5.4a; Flex scanners are now reenterant, you may have multiple
 scanners in the same program with differing sets of defaults, and
 they play nicer with modern C and C++ compilers. The Flip side is
 that Flex no longer conforms to the POSIX lex behaviour, and the
 scanners require conforming implementations when flex is used in ANSI
 C mode. The package flex-old provides the older behaviour.
 .
 This product includes software developed by the University of California,
 Berkeley and its contributors. The upstream source code can be found at
 http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lex/flex-2.5.31.tar.bz2?download

 line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping.  Instead of
 sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a
 ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion.

Description: management of regular background processing
 cron is a background process (`daemon') that runs programs at regular
 intervals (for example, every minute, day, week or month); which
 processes are run and at what times are specified in the `crontab'.
 .
 Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on
 their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to
 particular users.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do various standard
 system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not
 grow endlessly and overflow the disk.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recommends", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

Description: Update Configuration File: preserves user changes to config files.
 Debian policy states that configuration files must preserve user
 changes during package upgrade.  The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a `conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it.  This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile like handling for files that
 can not be labelled conffiles, are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead.  This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for "conffiles".
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided conffile like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 install time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides two commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator, and uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the xutils
 package.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xlibs-data package.

Description: mount and umount commands for the smbfs (for kernels >= than 2.2.x)
 Smbfs is a filesystem which understands the SMB protocol.
 This is the protocol Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT or
 LAN Manager use to talk to each other. It was inspired by
 samba, the program by Andrew Tridgell that turns any unix
 site into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.
 .
 If you want to use command-line utilities like smbclient, smbtar
 and/or smbspool you just need to install the smbclient package.
 .
 Starting with the Debian Samba packages version 2.2.0-1, the old smbfs
 utilities for 2.0.x have been removed. There are no wrapper scripts
 that call a specific smbmount/smbumount depending on the kernel
 version.  If you are using a 2.0.x kernel please upgrade or use the
 latest Samba 2.0.7 Debian package.

Description: GUI browser and editor for Debian Package Tags
 debtags-edit is an experimental GUI program for browsing the Debian package
 archive and tagging packages.  Its purpose is to make it easy and fast for
 everyone to update tag data.
 .
 Even if the program is still in the state of a prototype, it can already offer
 new and interesting package search functions, perform local customizations of
 the tag database and send local modifications for inclusion in the central tag
 archive.

Description: Image manipulation programs
 Imagemagick is a set of programs to manipulate various image formats
 (JPEG, TIFF, PhotoCD, PBM, XPM, etc...). All manipulations can
 be achieved through shell commands as well as through a X11 graphical
 interface (display).
 .
 Possible effects: colormap manipulation, channel operations, thumbnail
 creation, image annotation, limited drawing, image distortion, etc...
 .
 This package suggests a postscript interpreter (gs) to read postscript
 files. It will however function happily without it (as long as you don't
 want to read postscript).

 i.e. it works great with other window managers. But if you are looking
 for seamless integration on your desktop, wmavgload may suit your needs.

Description: GNU troff text-formatting system
 This package contains optional components of the GNU troff text-formatting
 system. The core package, groff-base, contains the traditional tools like
 troff, nroff, tbl, eqn, and pic. This package contains additional devices
 and drivers for output to DVI, HTML (when the recommended packages gs,
 netpbm, and psutils are installed), HP LaserJet printers, and Canon CAPSL
 LBP-4 and LBP-8 printers.
 .
 The X75, X75-12, X100, and X100-12 devices, which allow groff output to be
 conveniently viewed on an X display using the standard X11 fonts, are now
 included here. They were previously in a separate package, groff-x11.
 .
 Besides these, the groff package contains man pages describing the language
 and its macro sets, info documentation, and a number of supplementary
 programs:
 .
  - gxditview, which is used to display the output of the X* devices, and
    can also be used to view PostScript output from groff;
  - grn, a preprocessor for pictures in the 'gremlin' format;
  - tfmtodit, which creates font files for use with 'groff -Tdvi';
  - hpftodit, which creates font files for use with 'groff -Tlj4';
  - afmtodit, which creates font files for use with 'groff -Tps';
  - refer, which preprocesses bibliographic references for use with groff;
  - indxbib, which creates inverted indices for bibliographic databases used
    by 'refer';
  - lkbib and lookbib, which search bibliographic databases;
  - addftinfo, which adds metric information to troff font files for use
    with groff;
  - pfbtops, which translates a PostScript font in .pfb format to ASCII for
    use with groff;
  - mmroff, a simple groff preprocessor which expands references in mm;
  - pic2graph, which converts PIC diagrams into cropped image files;
  - eqn2graph, which converts EQN equations into cropped image files.
 .
 All the standard macro packages are supported.

 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Debian Font Manager -- automatic font configuration framework
 Defoma, which stands for DEbian FOnt MAnager, provides a framework
 for automatic font configuration. An application whose configuration
 of fonts usually requires manual intervention can automate the
 process through Defoma, by installing a Defoma-configuration
 script. The script gets called whenever a font is installed and
 removed, so that the script may update the application configuration.
 .
 Font packages should register their fonts to Defoma in order to have them
 configured automatically for applications.

Description: A Free command-line mp3 player, compatible with mpg123
 mpg321 is a clone of the popular mpg123 command-line mp3 player. It should
 function as a drop-in replacement for mpg123 in many cases. While some of
 the functionality of mpg123 is not yet implemented, mpg321 should function
 properly in most cases for most people, such as for frontends such as
 gqmpeg.
 .
 mpg321 is based on the mad MPEG audio decoding library. It therefore is
 highly accurate, and also uses only fixed-point calculation, making it
 more efficient on machines without a floating-point unit.
 .
 While mpg321 is not as fast as the non-free mpg123 on systems which have a
 floating point unit, it comes under a fully Free license, which allows greater
 freedom to its users. For most people who want mpg123, mpg321 is a better
 alternative.

 libraries in the client and link against Xmuu instead of Xmu, Xt, and Xaw.
 Needless to say, if the client uses functions from Xmu, Xt, or Xaw that are
 not present in Xmuu, it will fail to link.

 libnet features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer
 and link layer, as well as a host of supplementary functionality.
 .
 Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly applications can be
 whipped up with little effort. With a bit more time, more complex
 programs can be written (Traceroute and ping were easily rewritten
 using libnet and libpcap).
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: An Emacs major mode for editing SGML documents.
 PSGML is a major mode for the editor Emacs used for editing SGML
 documents.  It contains a simple SGML parser and can work with any
 DTD. (The most popular nowadays are the HTML DTDs.  This package
 turns your emacs into the one of most powerful HTML editors and will
 be ultimately flexible as well, since you could upgrade your editor
 by just installing new DTDs).  Functions provided includes menus and
 commands for inserting tags with only the contextually valid tags,
 identification of structural errors, editing of attribute values in a
 separate window with information about types and defaults, and
 structure based editing.
 .
 Since psgml parses the DTD to allow you to edit SGML documents, you do
 need to have the DTDs installed in order to use psgml.  Since psgml
 installs itself as an HTML mode in Emacs, it depends on sgml-data.  Some
 other packages which also provide SGML DTDs are suggested, like
 debiandoc-sgml and linuxdoc-sgml.
 .
 SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO
 standard: ISO 8879:1986 "Information processing - Text and office
 systems - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)".
 .
 Psgml is a standard package for XEmacs, and thus this package does not
 install itself for XEmacsen.

Description: Linux Standard Base 1.3 core support package
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of version 1.3 of the Linux
 Standard Base for Debian on the Intel x86, Intel ia64 (Itanium), IBM
 S390, and PowerPC 32-bit architectures with the Linux kernel.  Future
 revisions of the specification and this package may support the LSB
 on additional architectures and kernels.
 .
 The intent of this package is to provide a best current practice way
 of installing and running LSB packages on Debian GNU/Linux.  Its
 presence does not imply that we believe that Debian fully complies
 with the Linux Standard Base, and should not be construed as a
 statement that Debian is LSB-compliant.

 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.

Description: KDE personal organizer
 A complete calendar and scheduling program. KOrganizer supports information
 interchange with other calendar applications through the industry standard
 vCalendar file format.
 .
 KOrganizer aims to be a complete program for organizing your appointments,
 contacts, projects, etc. It is in the same spirit as similar programs like
 the now ubiquitous Microsoft Outlook, Starfish Internet Sidekick,
 Time & Chaos, etc. (all for the Microsoft Windows platform, of course.) Best
 of all, It reads and writes the vCalendar file format NATIVELY (please see
 http://www.imc.org/pdi for more information), which is now an industry-wide
 personal data interchange format. Because of this, you should be able to move
 from other modern PIMs to KOrganizer with relative ease. Current users of the
 popular program ical should definitely take a look at KOrganizer and compare
 features.
 .
 KOrganizer also offers full synchronization with your Palm Pilot, if you have
 kpilot installed.
 .
 This package is part of the official KDE pim module.

 This is Gimp-Print version 4.2.7, a stable release in
 the 4.2 line.
 .
 Gimp-Print is the print facility for the Gimp, and in addition a
 suite of drivers that may be used with common UNIX spooling systems
 using GhostScript or CUPS.  These drivers provide printing quality
 for UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary vendor-supplied drivers in
 many cases, and can be used for many of the most demanding printing
 tasks.

Description: Proxy DNS Server
 pdnsd is a proxy dns server with permanent caching (the cache contents are
 written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope with unreachable or
 down dns servers (for example in dial-in networking).
 pdnsd can be used with applications that do dns lookups, eg on startup, and
 can't be configured to change that behaviour, to prevent the often minute-long
 hangs (or even crashes) that result from stalled dns queries.
 Some Netscape Navigator versions for Unix, for example, expose this behaviour.

Description: a cron-like program that doesn't go by time
 Anacron (like `anac(h)ronistic') is a periodic command scheduler.  It
 executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it
 does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
 .
 This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the Debian
 system. You should install this program if your system isn't powered on
 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other Debian packages
 are executed each day.

Description: DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment
 DHCP is a protocol like BOOTP (actually dhcpd includes much of
 the functionality of BOOTPD!). It assigns IP addresses to clients
 based on lease times. DHCP is used extensively by Microsoft and more
 recently also by Apple. It is probably essential in any multi-platform
 environment.
 .
 Multiple Ethernet Interfaces are supported by this DHCP package.
 .
 Note: This package _requires_ a 2.2.x or later Linux kernel. 2.0.x
 kernels are _not_ supported.

Description: The GNU Parted disk partition resizing program
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
 resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and
 PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
 disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which
 are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16
 and FAT32) ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
 Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS,
 UFS (Sun and HP) and XFS filesystems, but cannot create,
 resize or check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install
 the libreiserfs0.3-0 package.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

 Historically, a2ps started as a text to PostScript converter, but thanks
 to powerful delegations it is able to let you use it for any kind of files,
 ie it can also digest manual pages, dvi files, texinfo, ....
 .
 Among the other most noticeable features of a2ps are:
  - various encodings (all the Latins and others),
  - various fonts (automatic font down loading),
  - various medias,
  - various printer interfaces,
  - various output styles,
  - various programming languages,
  - various helping applications,
  - and various spoken languages.

Description: A window manager with the NEXTSTEP look and feel
 AfterStep is a window manager based on FVWM which attempts to emulate
 the NEXTSTEP look and feel, while retaining the configurability of its
 predecessor.  Note that this window manager makes extensive use of the
 color palette.  If you have only an 8-bit color display, it will run
 as packaged, but you may want to modify the configuration to use fewer
 colors.
 .
 AfterStep is a continuation of the BowMan window manager project, but
 the name was changed to reflect the desire that it do more than
 simply emulate and become a valuable window manager in its own right.

Description: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
 of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
 changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  Unlike the simpler systems,
 CVS does not just operate on one file at a time or one directory at
 a time, but operates on hierarchical collections of directories
 consisting of version controlled files.
 .
 CVS helps to manage releases and to control the concurrent editing of
 source files among multiple authors.  CVS allows triggers to
 enable/log/control various operations and works well over a wide area
 network.

Description: Daemon for the device file system
 This daemon sets up the devfs file system for use. It sets permissions
 of devices, and creates compatibility symlinks to the old names when devices
 are created by drivers. It further tries to load the appropriate drivers
 automatically when not yet existing devices are accessed.
 .
 devfs is a virtual file system (it is not stored on a disc, instead it reflects
 the contents of kernel data structures) introduced in Linux 2.4 kernels to
 counter the explosive growth of the number of device nodes in /dev. devfs is
 mounted on /dev and displays all devices exported by _loaded_ kernel modules.
 MAKEDEV is no more needed. It is particularly helpful if you
  - have lots and lots of devices (USB, SCSI, etc)
  - do hot-plugging (adding and removing devices on the running system)
 .
 You need to have devfs mounted at boot for this to work. If you don't, your
 system will keep working as before (with normal on-disc device files). See
 README.Debian for hints on how to do this.
 .
 Your system will work perfectly well without devfs, it is by no means a
 requirement. Alternatives for devfs are:
  - common on-disk device files. This is what you get by default.
  - udev (see the udev package, requires a 2.6 Linux kernel).

 The DICT Development Group maintains several public servers which can
 be accessed from any machine connected to the Internet.  The default
 configuration is to query one of these servers first, but this may be
 changed in the configuration file /etc/dict.conf.
 .
 Queries may be customized by numerous command line options, including
 specifying the database(s) to be queried and the search strategy to
 be used.
 .
 dict includes dictl, which simplifies using utf-8 encoded dictionaries
 with terminals that do not support utf-8.

Description: Secure rlogin/rsh/rcp replacement (OpenSSH)
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It is intended as a replacement for rlogin, rsh and rcp, and can be
 used to provide applications with a secure communication channel.
 .
 This package provides both the ssh client and the sshd server.
 .
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.

 rcp, and uses the rsync remote-update protocol to greatly speed up
 file transfers when the destination file already exists.

Description: basic system security checks
 Checksecurity does some very basic system security checks, such as
 looking for changes in which programs have setuid permissions, and that
 remote filesystems are not allowed to have runnable setuid programs.
 Note that these are not to be considered in any way complete, and
 you should not rely on checksecurity to actually provide any useful
 information concerning the security or vulnerability of your system.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recommends", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.
 .
 Checksecurity was previously part of the cron package.

Description: Open Crypto Development Kit (OpenCDK) (runtime)
 This library provides functions to handle basic parts of the OpenPGP
 message format.
 .
 The aim of the library is *not* to replace any available PGP version.
 There will be no real support for key management (sign, revoke, alter
 preferences, ...) and some other parts are only rudimentarily
 available. The main purpose is to handle and understand OpenPGP
 packets and to execute basic operations on them. For example to
 encrypt/decrypt or to sign/verify keys and some packet routines.
 .
 Because of the fact that sensitive data is being handled, the
 library doesn't contain any real cryptographic code. The libgcrypt
 package is used for all crypto routines.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library for OpenCDK.

MD5sum: 2c11810a24eaefde473167985a5729e8
Description: Guess which LAN is connected to a network device
 guessnet takes a list of candidate profiles on input, each with one or
 more ways to scan for them, and runs each scan in parallel; the first scan
 that succeeds causes the corresponding name to be printed in standard output
 and the program to exit immediately.
 .
 Available scan methods are ARP probing for interface with a given macaddress,
 executing external scripts and checking for network link beat.  guessnet's
 internal design easily allows the implementation of new scan methods in the
 future.
 .
 guessnet can be used standalone or run in an "ifupdown mode" designed to
 seamlessly integrate with ifupdown.  In ifupdown mode, guessnet can be used
 in a "script" directive, reads candidate profiles directly from
 /etc/network/interfaces and in fact enhances an existing ifupdown
 configuration with smart network detection.

Description: Authentication abstraction library
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.
 .
 This is the Cyrus SASL API implementation, version 2.
 .
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT Kerberos 5 or Heimdal
 Kerberos 5), KERBEROS_V4, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can be used. This package
 is unusable without the SASL plugins. Most likely you will need to install
