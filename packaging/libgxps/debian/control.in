Description: handling and rendering XPS documents (development files)
 OpenXPS or XPS stands for XML Paper Specification. It is based on XML and it's 
 a new electronic paper format originally developed by Microsoft and it serves 
 as a PDF alternative. XPS files are usually created using "Microsoft XPS 
 Document Writer" in Windows environments. It is now standardized as an open 
 standard document format.
 .
 Quoting Wikipedia:
 An XPS file is in fact a Unicoded ZIP archive using the Open Packaging 
 Conventions, containing the files which make up the document. These include an 
 XML markup file for each page, text, embedded fonts, raster images, 2D vector 
 graphics, as well as the digital rights management information. The contents 
 of an XPS file can be examined simply by opening it in an application which 
 supports ZIP files.
 .
 The OpenXPS document format specification supports features such as color 
 gradients, transparencies, CMYK color spaces, printer calibration, 
 multiple-ink systems and print schemas.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
