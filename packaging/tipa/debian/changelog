tipa (2:1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Acknowledge NMU.  A big thanks to Norbert Preining and Frank Küster
    for taking care of the package while I was busy with other tasks.
    The following bugs have been fixed in the two previous NMUs:
    - FTBFS: Cannot find dh_installtexfonts (closes: #360728)
    - updmap was run as root (closes: #335990)
  * As a side effect, the package can now completely be removed through
    'dpkg --purge tipa' (closes: #195676; closes: #234942)
  * debian/patches/50_no-mktexlsr-in-makefile.dpatch: Added dpatch for
    changing Makefile to not call mktexlsr in the build rule (this patch
    was in the diff.gz since version 2:1.2-2.1)

  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no changes needed)
    - Moved debhelper from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-Depends, complying
      with section 7.6 of the Debian Policy
    - Added dpatch to Build-Depends
    - Dropped perl from Build-Depends (it is in build-essential)
    - Added homepage of the upstream package (at CTAN now) in Description
    - Changes the priorities of tipa to optional and xfonts-tipa to extra
      (closes: #348482)
  * debian/copyright: Updated homepage, author e-mail address, and
    copyright notice

  * debian/rules:
    - added get-orig-source.  This target downloads the tipa.zip file from
      CTAN and generates the appropriate orig.tar.gz. File tipaface.pdf is
      now included in the generated upstream tarball.
    - Removed processing of tipaface.pdf.uu
  * debian/tipaface.pdf.uu: Removed file (see above)
  * debian/docs: install doc/tipaface.pdf, instead of debian/tipaface.pdf

  * debian/conffiles, debian/xfonts-tipa.conffiles: Removed files, since
    the helper programs seem to inclide the configuration files
    automatically.

  * debian/watch: Added file

    - move pfb/afm links to /usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1
    - build-depends on debhelper >= 5.0.31, thus bumping compat level to 5:
      . install files into debian/$(package)/ and not into debian/tmp
      . remove dirs file, add the dirs to the dh_installdirs call
      . add several -p options to debhelper commands
      . remove the package.conffiles
    - fix defoma hints file for new location
    - move .scale file to new X11R7 location
    - xfonts-tipa: depend on tipa of same version, and defoma >= 0.5,

 -- Frank Küster <frank@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Jan 2006 12:54:36 +0100

tipa (2:1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

    changelog entry (2:1.1-3.0) for details.  Thanks to Frank Kuester
    <frank@kuesterei.ch> for his kind support.
  * debian/postinst, debian/postrm: Fixed path for update-updmap.

tipa (2:1.1-3.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Uploaded to experimental, since the package is not yet thoroughly
    tested.
  * debian/tipa.updmap: Added file.
  * debian/rules: Install debian/tipa.updmap as a configuration file named
    /etc/texmf/updmap.d/10tipa.cfg.  This conforms to the instructions in
    /usr/share/doc/tetex-bin/README.Debian.gz, which makes the tipa fonts
    available to other *TeX applications (closes: #223490).
  * debian/conffiles: Added /etc/texmf/updmap.d/10tipa.cfg
  * debian/postinst: Call update-updmap and updmap.
  * debian/postrm: Call update-updmap and updmap.  Rename 10tipa.cfg to
    10tipa.bak on remove and delete 10tipa.* on purge.
  * debian/dirs: Added directory etc/texmf/updmap.d

tipa (2:1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/gen-fonts-dir.pl: Make symbolic links for all .pfb and .afm
    files proveided by tipa.  This should fix problems with broken links
    to files in directory /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/ (closes: #163683).
  * debian/control: Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.7.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Nov 2002 15:07:57 +0100

tipa (2:1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved the defoma-hints file to the xfonts-tipa package.  It was
    erroneously associated with the tipa package, and was causing nasty
    warnings when abiword-common was installed with tipa but without
    xfonts-tipa (closes: #161076).  Thanks to Ian Zimmerman
    <itz@speakeasy.org>.
  * Let file /usr/share/doc/tipa/tipaface.pdf be compressed now, since its
    uncompressed size is huge.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Sep 2002 08:11:53 +0200

tipa (2:1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #160202).  This is the official 1.1
    release, so that the package version number is preceded by a "2:" now,
    in order to become higher than the previous 1:1.1.beta-4.
  * debian/control: Added a better description to the tipa package
    (closes: #159186).
  * debian/rules: Apply patch to the upstream Makefile
    (debian/Makefile.patch).  Among other fixes, afm files are included in
    the tipa package (closes: #145830).  USe now the upstream
    dh_installdefoma, which has been fixed.
  * debian/tipaface.pdf.uu: Added this file to the /usr/share/doc directory.
    It is provided at the main ftp site for the TIPA package, but is not
    included in the distribution tarball.  Uudecode it in debian/rules
    (this is why sharutils is added to Build-Depends in debian/control).
  * debian/docs: Added debian/tipaface.pdf.
  * debian/doc-base.tipa-manual, debian/doc-base.tipa-vowel, and
    debian/doc-base.tipa-typefaces: Added files.
  * debian/copyright: Updated to reflect the use of LPPL as the license.

tipa (1:1.1.beta-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Remove hack for fixing the code from
    prerm-defoma-hints.  The prerm script contains now purge-all and not
    purge-all-all.  (This closes: #145519, thanks to Gerfried Fuchs
    <alfie@debian.org>).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu,  2 May 2002 22:02:23 +0200

tipa (1:1.1.beta-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Added tetex-extra to Build-Depends-Indep, so that file
    mflogo.sty is found (closes: #142136).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Apr 2002 00:17:25 +0200

tipa (1:1.1.beta-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/dirs: Removed extraneous directory entries.  This is old stuff
    and was causing some empty directories to appear in the package
    (closes: #130262).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Jan 2002 17:46:29 +0100

tipa (1:1.1.beta-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #129460).
  * The package xfonts-tipa is now generated from the tipa package source.
    xfonts-tipa was generated before by the tipa-type1 source package,
    which contained the .pfb files generated independently by Taco
    Hoekwater and available at CTAN.  The package tipa-type1 is now
    obsolete, since the type1 fonts are included in package tipa.
  * Use defoma for font registration and install the X fonts in the right
    directory.  Use dh_installxfonts for updating correctly  (closes: #128577).
  * By the way, the latest version of the defoma package (0.10.1) is
    bugggy.  This is why a fixed dh_installdefoma is provided in the
    debian/ directory and there is a piece of code in debian/rules to
    fix the prerm script of the xfonts-tipa package.  These fixes will go
    away when Bugs #129824 and #129953 filled against the defoma package
    will be fixed.
  * The package does not mess anymore with the udpmap script from the
    tetex-base package (closes: #123432).  It is now up to the user to
    enable dvips and pdflatex for using the type1 fonts.  A note has been
    added to debian/README.Debian.
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.6.
    - Added Build-Depends-Indep.
    - Changed e-mail address of maintainer.
  * debian/rules: Several improvements.  Too many to describe here.  By
    the way, this Debian package has undergone a quite major overhaul
    since its latest upstream release six years ago.

    due to the last update of LaTeX (Dec. 1998) that was causing T3enc.def
    to be read twice (closes: bug#36481).
  * Much improved postinst and postrm scripts.  In particular, test for
    existence of texhash before launching it (closes: bug#35559).
  * Installing files under /usr/share instead of /usr/lib, as this is the
    new standard location.
  * tipa now suggests the package tipa-type1.
  * During the package building, rename the *.def to lowercase before
    building the docs.  This was causing a dbuild error.
