Description: Markov Chains for random sequence generation
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This library can be used to generate random sequences with a behaviour
 adapted to some training data. The algorithm analyses your input/training
 data with respect to how likely a given letter follows another one, then
 on recomposition it chooses subsequent letters randomly according to the
 frequencies found in the training data.
