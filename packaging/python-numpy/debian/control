Package: python-numpy
Architecture: any
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: python-numpy-doc, python-numpy-dbg, python-nose (>= 0.10.1), python-dev, gfortran, gcc (>= 4:4.6.1-5)
Provides: ${python:Provides}, ${numpy:Provides}, python-numpy-dev, python-f2py
Description: Numerical Python adds a fast array facility to the Python language
 Numpy contains a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated
 (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran
 code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number
 capabilities.
 .
 Numpy replaces the python-numeric and python-numarray modules which are
 now deprecated and shouldn't be used except to support older
 software.

Package: python-numpy-dbg
Priority: extra
Section: debug
Architecture: any
Depends: python-numpy (= ${binary:Version}), python-dbg, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Fast array facility to the Python language (debug extension)
 Numpy contains a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated

 code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number
 capabilities.
 .
 Numpy replaces the python-numeric and python-numarray modules which
 are now deprecated and shouldn't be used except to support older
 software.
 .
 This package contains the extension built for the Python debug interpreter.
