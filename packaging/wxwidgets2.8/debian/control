Description: wxBase library (runtime) - non-GUI support classes of wxWidgets toolkit
 wxBase is a collection of C++ classes providing basic data structures
 (strings, lists, arrays), powerful wxDateTime class for date manipulations,
 portable wrappers around many OS-specific functions allowing the same
 program to work for all supported platforms, wxThread class for writing
 multithreaded programs, and much more.
 .
 wxBase currently supports the following platforms: Generic Unix (Linux,
 FreeBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, ...), Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X.
 .
 This package is only useful for non-GUI apps.  It offers a subset of the
 classes in libwx_gtk2.8 for use in console apps and daemons.  You do not need
 this package to build or use wxWidgets GUI apps.

 provides many internal checks by wxWidgets itself that are not performed on
 apps compiled with the 'release version' libs in the -dev package.
