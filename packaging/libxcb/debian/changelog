libxcb (1.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cherry-pick from upstream 1.9:
    Fix a multi-thread deadlock.  This fixes a deadlock which was seen
    in-the-wild with wine.  It could happen that two threads tried to read
    from the socket at the same time and one of the thread got stuck inside of
    poll()/select().  The fix works by making sure that the writing thread
    doesn't steal the reading thread's reply.  Closes: #689269.
