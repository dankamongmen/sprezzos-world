audacity (1.1.99pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream 1.2 prerelease.  Far too many new features to list.
  * Audacity 1.2 does not support opening MIDI files, so the
    Open Midi -> Export Ogg crash is no longer triggerable (closes: #150654)
  * Audacity 1.2 performs checks to guard against multiple instances
    running concurrently, to prevent multiple instances from interfering
    with each others temporary files.  (closes: #182782)
  * We now use libsndfile for sound file i/o, so 8 bit files should
    no longer be distorted.  (closes: #187304)
  * Recompile should fix weird, unexplainable, unreproducable runtime
    linking error. (closes: #187504)
  * Audacity 1.2 has a completely new audio i/o backend.  The code that
    caused a problem when changing devices in the preferences has been
    completely rewritten.  (closes: #188808)
  * We no longer link against id3lib (thank goodness) so the FTBFS that
    was clearly caused by id3lib should no longer be an issue.

audacity (0.98-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New build-depends on libwxgtk2.2-dev (>=2.2.9.2) should solve any

    libpng2, since this is what the libwxgtk2.2 maintainer decided on.

  * Fixed subtle but serious bug in libmad mp3 importing code that would

  * Build-depends on wxWindows and libpng are versioned to force libpng3
    for both. (closes: #128463)

audacity (0.97.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Eliminated build-dependency on 'zip' by pre-zipping the help file. I was
    previously unaware that zip is in non-us, making the build-dep a policy
    violation. Unfortunately, this required a new source tarball, since
    Debian diffs don't seem to allow binary files.

audacity (0.97.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream prerelease. Upstream we have fixed many important bugs, but
    the next full release may not be ready for Debian's freeze. These
    fixes should definitely go in woody.
  * Audacity no longer includes its own complete copy of libmpeg3 and
    id3lib; instead we link against the debian packages libmad0-dev and
    libid3-dev. This effectively sidesteps the problems of id3lib
    building (or not building) on 64 bit architectures.
