  * include html and print changelogs (rather than just having an empty
    dir); get rid of empty <doc>/test subdir

    easier to override procedures in dbl1XX.dsl
  * fix the compatibility symlink at
    /usr/lib/sgml/stylesheet/dsssl/docbook/nwalsh to the real location
    (but I notice due to a bug in dpkg, if you have a dir there, you 
     probably have to remove and reinstall the package)
  * building requires new sgml-data 1.5.4 or better, we use a new arg to
    sgml-catalog-check.pl; fix a problem in the invocation of that which
    was causing the compatibility symlinks to be created in the wrong
    place

  * new upstream experimental version

  * debian/rules: provide /var/www/docbook-stylesheets symlink to the
    stylesheet images dir, and hack on dbparam for HTML to use this
    reference; this will work if you're using a web server to view the
    images (considered the default case) but admonition and callout images
    won't work for just viewing via file: references.  Suggestions on how
    to fix that welcome.
  * debian/rules: fix the path for admonition graphics in
    print/dbparam.dsl too (hmm, print doesn't seem to use callout
    graphics?  Odd...)
  * README.Debian: talk about Debian changes in */dbparam.dsl
  * debian/rules: get rid of pesky doc files 0 bytes long distributed by
    Norm
  * debian/control: recommends on apache | httpd | www-browser, see
    README.Debian for why; doc package depends on lynx | www-browser |
