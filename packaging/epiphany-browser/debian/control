Description: Intuitive GNOME web browser
 Epiphany is a simple yet powerful GNOME web browser targeted at
 non-technical users. Its principles are simplicity and standards
 compliance.
 .
 Simplicity is achieved by a well designed user interface and reliance
 on external applications for performing external tasks (such as reading
 email). Simplicity does not mean less features; Epiphany has everything
 a modern web browser is expected to have, and can have more through
 its extensions.
 .
 Standards compliance is achieved on the HTML side by using the
 WebKitGTK+ rendering engine (which is based on the engine used by
 Apple Safari and Google Chrome); and on the user interface side by
 closely following the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and by
 close integration with the GNOME desktop.
