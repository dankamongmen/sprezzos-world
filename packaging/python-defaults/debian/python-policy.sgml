	<heading>Versions</heading>
	<p>
	  At any given time, the binary package <package>python</package>
	  will represent the current default Debian Python version.  The
	  binary package <package>python3</package> will represent the current
	  Debian Python 3 version.  As far as is reasonable, python and python3
	  should be treated as separate runtime systems with minimal
	  interdependencies.  In some cases, Python policy explicitly references
	  Python helper programs such as python-support and python-central.  None of
	  these references apply to Python 3.  It is a design goal to fully specify
	  required interfaces and functions in policy for Python 3 and to avoid
	  enshrining specific implmentation details in policy.  Except as noted,
	  policy for Python 3 is the same as Python with the addition of the version
	  number as needed to distinguish them.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The default Debian Python version should always be the latest stable
	  upstream release that can be fully integrated in the distribution.
	  There may be newer supported or unsupported versions included in
	  the distribution if they are not fully integrated for a particular
	  release.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Apart from the default version, legacy versions of Python
	  or beta versions of future releases
	  may be included as well in the distribution, as long as they
	  are needed by other packages, or as long as it seems
	  reasonable to provide them.  (Note: For the scope of this
	  document, Python versions are synonymous to feature
	  releases, i.e. Python 2.7 and 2.7.1 are sub-minor versions of
	  the same Python version 2.7, but Python 2.6 and 2.7 are
	  indeed different versions.)
	</p>
	<p>
	  For any version, the main binary package must be called
	  <package>python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></package>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The set of currently supported python versions can be found in
	  <file>/usr/share/python/debian_defaults</file>.  This file is in
	  Python ConfigParser format and defines four variables in its
	  DEFAULT section: default-version which is the current default
	  Python runtime, supported-versions which is the set of runtimes
	  currently supported and for which modules should be built and
	  byte-compiled, old-versions which is the list of runtimes which
	  might still be on the system but for which should not be built
	  anymore, and unsupported-versions which is the list of runtimes
	  which should not be supported at all, that is modules should not be
	  built or byte-compiled for these.  The supported interface to this
	  file is <file>/usr/bin/pyversions</file>.  The Python 3 interface is
	  through <file>/usr/bin/py3versions</file>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  unsupported-versions is a superset of (includes) old-versions and
	  the default-version is always in supported-versions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Newer versions might also appear in unsupported-versions before
	  being moved to supported-versions.

	<p>
	  For every Python version provided in the distribution, the binary
	  package <package>python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></package> shall
	  provide a complete distribution for <em>deployment</em> of Python
	  scripts and applications. The package must ensure that the binary
	  <file>/usr/bin/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></file> is provided.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Installation of <package>python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></package>
	  shall provide the modules of the upstream Python distribution with
	  some exceptions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Excluded are modules  that cannot be included for licensing
	  reasons (for example the profile module), for dependency tracking
	  purposes (for example the GPL-licensed gdbm module) or that should
	  not be included for packaging reasons (for example the tk module
	  which depends on Xorg).

	  Some tools and files for the <em>development</em> of Python
	  modules are split off in a separate binary package
	  <package>python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var>-dev</package>.

	  Documentation will be provided separately as well.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At any time, the <package>python</package> binary package must
	  ensure that <file>/usr/bin/python</file> is provided as a symlink
	  to the current <file>python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></file>
	  executable.

	  The <package>python</package> binary package must also depend on
	  the appropriate <package>python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></package>
	  to ensure this runtime is installed.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The version of the <package>python</package> binary package must
	  be greater than or equal to <var>X</var>.<var>Y</var> and smaller
	  than <var>X</var>.<var>Y+1</var>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Because upstream has started providing it, there will be a symlink
	  for <file>/usr/bin/python2</file> for Wheezy and later releases.  See
	  <url id="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/" name="PEP-0394">
	  for details. Packages must be careful to depend on a sufficient
	  version of <package>python</package> if they make use of this symlink.

	  For every Python version provided in the distribution, the

          <p>
	    Python scripts depending on the default Python version (see <ref
	    id="base">) or not depending on a specific Python version should
	    use <file>python</file> (without a version) as the interpreter name.
	    </p>
          <p>
	    Python scripts that only work with a specific Python version must

        <sect1 id="interpreter_loc">

          <p>
	    The preferred specification for the Python interpreter is
            <file>/usr/bin/python</file> or
            <file>/usr/bin/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></file>.
	    This ensures that a Debian installation of python is used
	    and all dependencies on additional python modules are met.
          </p>
          <p>
	    Maintainers should not override the Debian Python interpreter using
	    <file>/usr/bin/env python</file> or
	    <file>/usr/bin/env python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></file>. This is
	    not advisable as it bypasses Debian's dependency checking and makes
	    the package vulnerable to incomplete local installations of python.

        </sect1>
      </sect>

      <sect id="paths">
	<heading>Module Path</heading>
	<p>
	  By default, Python modules are searched in the directories listed
	  in the PYTHONPATH environment variable and in the sys.path Python
	  variable.  Since python2.4 version 2.4.5-3, python2.5 version
	  2.5.2-7, python2.6 version 2.6.2-1, and in all python2.7 versions,
          sys.path does not include a
	  /usr/lib/python<var>X</var><var>Y</var>.zip entry anymore.

	  Directories with private Python modules must be absent from the
	  sys.path.

	  Public Python modules not handled by python-central or
	  python-support must be installed in the system Python modules
	  directory, /usr/lib/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var>/dist-packages
	  for python2.6 and later, and
	  /usr/lib/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var>/site-packages for
	  python2.5 and earlier. Public Python 3 modules must be installed in
	  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages.

	  Modules managed by python-support are installed in another
	  directory which is added to the sys.path using the .pth mechanism.
	  The .pth mechanism is documented in the Python documentation of the
	  <tt>site</tt> module.

	  A special directory is dedicated to public Python modules
	  installed by the local administrator,
	  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages for all python3 versions, 
	  /usr/local/lib/python2.<var>Y</var>/dist-packages for python2.6 and
	  later, and /usr/local/lib/python2.<var>Y</var>/site-packages for
	  python2.5 and earlier.

	  For a local installation by the administrator of python2.6 and
	  later, a special directory is reserved to Python modules which
	  should only be available to this Python,
	  /usr/local/lib/python2.<var>Y</var>/site-packages (and
	  /usr/local/lib/python3/site-packages for all python3 versions).
	  Unfortunately, for python2.5 and earlier this directory is also
	  visible to the system Python.

	  Additional information on appending site-specific paths to the
	  module search path is available in the official documentation of
	  the site module.
	</p>

	<p>
	  When binary packages ship identical source code for multiple
	  Python versions, for instance
	  /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/foo.py and
	  /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/foo.py, these should point to a
	  common file. Version specific directories for identical source code
          are not required for python3 and must not be used for this.

	  A common location to share, across Python versions,
	  arch-independent files which would otherwise go to the directory
	  of system public modules is /usr/share/pyshared. For python3,
	  a special location is not required, use
	  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages

      <sect id="runtimes_hooks">
	<heading>Hooks for updates to installed runtimes</heading>
	<p>
	  The <package>python</package> binary package has special hooks to
	  allow other packages to act upon updates to the installed
	  runtimes.

	  This mechanism is required to handle changes of the default Python
	  runtime in some packages and to enable the Python packaging
	  helpers.

	  There are three supported hook types which come in the form of
	  scripts which are invoked from the maintainer scripts of the
	  Python runtime packages when specific installations,
	  removals, or upgrades occur.

	      /usr/share/python/runtime.d/*.rtinstall: these are called when

	    </p>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <p>

	      "rtupdate", called when changing the default runtime, or
	      "post-rtupdate", called immediately afterwards.  The second
	      argument is the old default runtime (for example

      <heading>Packaged Modules</heading>
      <p>
	The goal of these policies is to reduce the work necessary for
	Python transitions. Python modules are internally very
	dependent on a specific Python version. However, we want to
	automate recompiling modules when possible, either during the
	upgrade itself (re-byte-compiling pyc and pyo files) or shortly
	thereafter with automated rebuilds (to handle C
	extensions). These policies encourage automated dependency
	generation and loose version bounds whenever possible.
      <sect>
	<heading>Types of Python Modules</heading>
	<p>
	  There are two kinds of Python modules, "pure" Python
	  modules, and extension modules. Pure Python modules are
	  Python source code that generally works across many versions of
	  Python. Extensions are C code compiled and linked against a
	  specific version of the python runtime, and so can only
	  be used by one version of Python.

	  Some distributions link extensions to libpython, but this is not
	  the case in Debian as symbols might as well be resolved by
	  <file>/usr/bin/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var></file> which is not
	  linked to libpython.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Python packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace
	  by using “dotted module names”.  See 
	  <url id="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#packages"
	  name="Python's documentation"> for details on how packages are
	  defined in Python terms (A package in the Python sense is unrelated to a
          Debian package). Python packages must be packaged into the
          same directory (as done by upstream). Splitting components
          of a package across directories changes the import order and
          may confuse documentation tools and IDEs.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are two ways to distribute Python modules. Public
	  modules are installed in a public directory as listed
	  in <ref id="paths">. They are accessible to any
	  program. Private modules are installed in a private directory such
	  as <file>/usr/share/<var>package-name</var></file>
	  or <file>/usr/lib/<var>package-name</var></file>. They are
	  generally only accessible to a specific program or suite of
	  programs included in the same package.
	</p>
      </sect>
      <sect id="package_names">
	<heading>Module Package Names</heading>
	<p>
	  Public modules used by other packages must have their binary
	  package name prefixed with <var>python-</var>.  It is recommended
	  to use this prefix for all packages with public modules as they may
	  be used by other packages in the future.  Python 3 modules must be
	  in a separate binary package prefixed with <var>python3-</var> to
	  preserve run time separation between python and python3.

	  The binary package for module foo should preferably be named
	  <package>python-<var>foo</var></package>, if the module name
	  allows, but this is not required if the binary package ships
	  multiple modules.  In the latter case the maintainer chooses the
	  name of the module which represents the package the most.

	  Such a package should support the current Debian Python version,
	  and more if possible (there are several tools to help implement
	  this, see <ref id="packaging_tools">). For example, if Python 2.5,
	  2.6, and 2.7 are supported, the Python statement
	  <example>
import foo
	  </example>
	  should import the module when the user is running any
	  of <prgn>/usr/bin/python2.5</prgn>, <prgn>/usr/bin/python2.6</prgn>,
	  and <prgn>/usr/bin/python2.7</prgn>. This requirement also
	  applies to extension modules; binaries for all the supported
	  Python versions should be included in a single package.
	</p>
      </sect>
      <sect id="specifying_versions">
	<heading>Specifying Supported Versions</heading>
	<p>
	  The optional <tt>X-Python-Version</tt> (preferred) or <tt>
	  XS-Python-Version</tt> field in the general paragraph (the first one,
	  for the source package) of <file>debian/control</file> specifies the
	  versions of Python (not versions of Python 3) supported by the
	  source package. Similarly, <tt>X-Python3-Version</tt> is used to
	  specify the versions of Python 3 supported by the package.  When not
	  specified, they default to all currently supported Python (or Python 3)
	  versions.

	  They are used by some packaging scripts to automatically generate
	  appropriate Depends and Provides lines. The format of the
	  field may be one of the following:
	  <example>
X-Python-Version: >= X.Y
X-Python-Version: >= A.B, << X.Y
XS-Python-Version: A.B, X.Y
XS-Python-Version: all
	  </example>
	  The keyword "all" means that the package supports any Python
	  version available but might be deprecated in the future since
	  using version numbers is clearer than "all" and encodes more
	  information.  The keyword "all" is limited to Python versions and
	  must be ignored for Python 3 versions. Lists of multiple individual
	  versions (e.g. 2.4, 2.5, 2.6) work for <tt>XS-Python-Version</tt> and
	  will continue to be supported, but are not recommended and are not
	  supported by <tt>X-Python-Version</tt> or <tt>X-Python3-Version</tt>
	  for Wheezy and later releases.

	  The keyword "current" has been deprecated and used to mean that
	  the package would only have to support a single version (even
	  across default version changes).  It must be ignored for Python 3
	  versions. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The use of XB-Python-Version in the binary package paragraphs of
	  debian/control file has been deprecated and should be removed in the
	  normal course of package updates. It never achieved sufficient
	  deployment to support it's intended purpose of managing Python
          transitions.  This can be adequately accomplished by examining
	  package dependencies.

	  modules (<file>foo.pyc</file> files) and optimized modules
	  (<file>foo.pyo</file> files) must not ship in the

	  Pure Python modules in private installation directories that are

	  <p>
	    A program using <file>/usr/bin/python</file> as
	    interpreter can come up with private Python modules. These
	    modules should be installed in
	    <tt>/usr/share/<var>module</var></tt>, or
	    <tt>/usr/lib/<var>module</var></tt> if the modules are
	    architecture-dependent (e.g. extensions).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The rules explained in <ref id="byte_compilation"> apply to
	    those private modules: the byte-compiled modules must not
	    be shipped with the binary package, they should be generated in
	    the package's postinst, using the current default Python
	    version, and removed in the prerm. Modules should be
	    byte-compiled using the current default Python version.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Programs that have private compiled extensions must either
	    handle multiple version support themselves, or declare a
	    tight dependency on the current Python version
	    (e.g. <tt>Depends: python (>= 2.6), python (<< 2.7)</tt>. No 
	    tools currently exist to alleviate this situation.

	This section describes the various tools to help package

	<p>
	  The standard Python distutils module has been modified in Debian to
	  change the default installation directory of public Python modules
	  and to add a new flag to the "install" command to override the
	  default, <prgn>--install-layout=</prgn>.

	  To allow the use this flag, maintainers should ensure that at
	  least version 2.6.2-1 will be used for python2.6, version 2.5.4-1
	  for python2.5, and version 2.4.6-2 for python2.4.  This flag is
	  parsed but ignored in python2.4 and python2.5.

	  Public Python modules installed with a modified distutils default
	  to /usr/local/lib/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var>/dist-packages
	  for python2.6 and later.  This directory is seen by the
	  system-provided python2.6.

	  When using a system-provided python2.4 or python2.5, the default
	  is /usr/lib/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var>/site-packages which is
	  seen by the system-provided python2.4 and python2.5 versions, but
	  not by a system-provided python2.6 and later versions.

	  When using a local Python installation, the default is
	  /usr/local/lib/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var>/site-packages which
	  is only seen by the local Python installation.

	  Using the <prgn>--install-layout=deb</prgn> flag to the "install"
	  command of <prgn>setup.py</prgn> with a system-provided python2.6 or
	  later versions, Python modules will be installed to
	  /usr/lib/python<var>X</var>.<var>Y</var>/dist-packages which is only
	  seen by the system-provided python, not by a local installation.

	  Using the <prgn>--install-layout=deb</prgn> flag to
	  <prgn>setup.py</prgn> with a system-provided python2.4 or
	  python2.5 does not affect the default installation directory.
