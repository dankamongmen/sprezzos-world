      binary packages.
    - Split evince-common containing platform-independent files shared between
      evince and evince-gtk packages.
  * debian/evince.manpages, debian/evince-gtk.manpages:
    - Moved to evince-common.manpages as they shared the evince-thumbnailer
      manpage and because evince manpage is installed by evince-common.
  * debian/rules:
    - Install under debian/tmp by default.

  * Don’t split the docs, given their size.
  * Ship the backends with the library; the library needs them anyway,

  * Install evince-thumbnailer.1 in evince-common.
  * Install the XPM in evince-common.
