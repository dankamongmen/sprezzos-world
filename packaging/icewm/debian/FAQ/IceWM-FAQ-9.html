<H2><A NAME="s9">9.</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9">Miscellaneous Questions</A></H2>

<P>This section is a collection of questions on subjects that go beyond
simply <B>using</B> IceWM.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9.1">What does Logout(Cancel) Command do?</A>
</H2>

<P>For most users, nothing. Both commands were meant for GNOME
integration as alternative commands that would be run when users
initiated a logout or logout cancel. Since GNOME did not seem to
incorporate this feature, they generally go unused.</P>

<H2><A NAME="CLI"></A> <A NAME="ss9.2">9.2</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9.2">What is the blank field in the task bar good for?</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are running IceWM with the
<CODE>&quot;TaskBarDoubleHeight&quot;</CODE> option set, a blank field in
the task bar occurs. It is a command line interface.</P>
<P>In this field you can enter commands to start programs. If you click
inside the field and enter <CODE>xclock</CODE> the X clock is
started.</P>
<P>If you click on it and simply press <CODE>&quot;Ctrl-Enter&quot;</CODE>
an XTerm is being started.</P>
<P>If you enter a non-X command and press
<CODE>&quot;Ctrl-Enter&quot;</CODE> an that command is being executed in
an XTerm.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9.3">How to keep IceWM from grabbing keystrokes</A>
</H2>

<P>What if you are running an application and need to use a keystroke
that is grabbed by IceWM?</P>
<P>Marko suggests the following workaround:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Activate scroll lock</LI>
<LI>Do problematic key stroke</LI>
<LI>Deactivate scroll lock</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>He advises that this will only work if
<CODE>&quot;ScrollLock&quot;</CODE> is set up as a modifier.</P>
<P>Here is how to use the X11 <CODE>xmodmap</CODE> utility to setup <CODE>ScrollLock</CODE> as
a modifier (from Marco Molteni):
<OL>
<LI> check which modifiers are free:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    $ xmodmap -pm

    xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

    shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
    lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
    control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
    mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
    mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
    mod3
    mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_R (0x74)
    mod5      
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI> in this example <CODE>mod3</CODE> is free, so we bind the <CODE>ScrollLock</CODE> key to it:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   $ xmodmap -e "add mod3 = Scroll_Lock"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

   
this invocation of <CODE>xmodmap</CODE> should be put in the script that starts the
window manager, for example <CODE>$HOME/.xinit</CODE> or <CODE>$HOME/.xsession</CODE>, see 
<A HREF="IceWM-FAQ-3.html#defwm">Howto make IceWM default WM</A> for more detailed info
about startup of WM or use IceWM's 
<A HREF="IceWM-FAQ-4.html#startup">startup</A>.</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9.4">How to lock the screen</A>
</H2>

<P>Screen locking is something you should do whenever you leave your
machine (even at home and even for only a few seconds - just imagine
a cat pushing the enter button at the wrong moment). It should be a
habit like logging out root as soon as possible.</P>

<H3>... by keyboard</H3>

<P>With IceWM screen locking is very easy: If you press</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    Ctrl-Alt-Del
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>a menu pops up offering you the following tasks:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Lock <CODE>&quot;W&quot;</CODE>orkstation</LI>
<LI><CODE>&quot;L&quot;</CODE>ogout</LI>
<LI><CODE>&quot;C&quot;</CODE>ancel</LI>
<LI><CODE>&quot;R&quot;</CODE>estart icewm</LI>
<LI>Re<CODE>&quot;b&quot;</CODE>oot</LI>
<LI>Shut<CODE>&quot;d&quot;</CODE>own</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The letters that are emphasized in this FAQ are underlined in real
life. The meaning of this emphasis is that you may e. g. press
<CODE>&quot;W&quot;</CODE> to lock your workstation.</P>
<P>Another possibility (this is the one I prefer because I once to often
pressed <CODE>&quot;L&quot;</CODE> in order to lock my machine) is to
press <CODE>&quot;ENTER&quot;.</CODE> The result is the same because the
button that is active by default is <EM>&quot;Lock
Workstation&quot;.</EM></P>
<P>A more obvious reason for using <CODE>&quot;ENTER&quot;</CODE> in place
of <CODE>&quot;W&quot;</CODE> is that it is easier to type in:
<CODE>&quot;Del&quot;</CODE> and <CODE>&quot;ENTER&quot;</CODE> are next to
each other.</P>
<P>You could as well use your mouse to click on <EM>&quot;Lock
Workstation&quot;</EM> but if you are already using your keyboard to
evoke the menu why not use the keyboard to select from it?</P>

<H3>... by mouse</H3>

<P>If you prefer to use your mouse to lock the screen you may add the
following entry to your <CODE>$HOME/.icewm/toolbar</CODE></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    prog    xlock   xlock   xlock
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You could as well add that line
<CODE>$HOME/.icewm/menu</CODE> or
<CODE>$HOME/.icewm/programs</CODE> but that's not a good
idea: Screen locking is often done in a hurry and if you have to scan
through a menu this will increase the chance that you will not lock
your machine at all.</P>

<H3>... using a lock command other than xlock</H3>

<P>How to define a different lock command is described in section 
<A HREF="IceWM-FAQ-5.html#locking">Setting the lock command</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9.5">Does IceWM support session management?</A>
</H2>

<P>Of course not. This is where the more complicated desktop environments like
GNOME, KDE or xfce join the game. IceWM still is only a window manager...
but of course you can always start your favorite apps upon X start-up/login
using the <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> or <CODE>.xsession</CODE>files. Or use IceWM as the
window manager instead of the default GNOME/KDE wm.</P>

<H2><A NAME="iconsondesk"></A> <A NAME="ss9.6">9.6</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9.6">Can I have icons on the desktop? </A>
</H2>

<P>Sure, but not from IceWM. Again, this is desktop environment work, but
usually done by the respective file managers, since they already know about
MIME types, file endings and such. IceWM users usually use idesk, dfm, rox, kfm or gmc,
where idesk, dfm and rox are better suited for work on smaller (older) machines than the
other two.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.7">9.7</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9.7">Why doesn't IceWM accept my background image/color?</A>
</H2>

<P>Usually this is because it's the wrong image format. It can happen when
IceWM is compiled only with libXpm.
With imlib, IceWM is able to read most of the often used image
formats like png, gif, jpeg, instead of just xpm images with libXpm. Another
reason can be, that the theme defines another image or color.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.8">9.8</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9.8">Can I have bigger icons in menu, taskbar, quickswitch etc.?</A>
</H2>

<P>No. At this time IceWM handles only default sizes of icons. For
menu and taskbar it is 16x16 pixels, for quickswitch it uses 32x32 pixels.
There is a patch that enables IceWM to handle different sizes of icons in icewm 
patch tracker, but it is not fully prepared yet.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.9">9.9</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc9.9">How can I translate IceWM into my language?</A>
</H2>

<P>Create a copy of <CODE>icewm.pot</CODE> and rename it to 
<CODE>cs.po</CODE> or whatever is right for your language.</P>
<P>Then you have to translate the file using any of the tools for
gettext file transaltion, e.g. kbabel, or you can edit it by hand.
After translation you can send it to icewm-devel list or post it
as patch in patch tracker.</P>

<P>If you want to test file yourself you can add this file 
into <CODE>po</CODE> directory under IceWM sources and then configure IceWM
(<CODE>./configure</CODE>) and type <CODE>make</CODE> in <CODE>po</CODE> directory.
This creates .mo file, which you can either copy to locale locations
(e.g. /usr/local/share/locale/cs/LC_MESSAGES) or you can do <CODE>make install</CODE>.</P>
