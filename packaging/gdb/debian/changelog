gdb (6.8.50.20090628-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New snapshot from trunk.  The experimental packages used the
    archer-tromey-python branch; the whole branch has not been merged
    to trunk, but significant portions of it have, and will be in GDB 7.
    So this includes some Python scripting support.  Other highlights
    since the last experimental package:
    - Reverse debugging commands.  With a remote target that supports
      reverse debugging, you can step backwards as easily as forwards.
    - Process record and replay, a native Linux implementation of
      reverse debugging.  Only 32-bit IA32 Linux is currently supported.
    - MIPS/Linux hardware watchpoint support.
    - Multi-byte and wide character set support, including wchar_t display.
    - Inlined function support, including in backtrace and step/next/finish.
    - Improved C++ template name parsing.
    - Non-stop debugging (some threads remain running while others
      are stopped in the debugger).  Only implemented so far for i386,
      x86-64, and powerpc.
    - A bug fix for discontiguous code, e.g. as found in the Linux kernel
      (Closes: #513816).
    - A build fix that affected SPARC (Closes: #512121).
    - A build fix for casts on hurd-i386 (Closes: #494839).
    - A fix for debugging multi-threaded programs that call exec, including
      Eclipse with the Sun JVM (Closes: #490046).
  * Removed thread-db-multiple-libraries.patch.  This let one GDB work with
    both LinuxThreads and NPTL, but no Debian platform has both now.
  * GDB now reads /etc/gdb/gdbinit at startup (Closes: #33187).
  * Ship required libraries (libbfd, libopcodes, and libiberty) in
    /usr/lib/gdb in the libgdb-dev package, in case binutils-dev's versions
    are not close enough (Closes: #509873).
  * Add dev package dependencies to libgdb-dev.

gdb (6.8.50.20081120.python-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Package archer-tromey-python branch for experimental.  Highlights since
    GDB 6.8 (for more, see the NEWS file):
    - Python scripting support.  This is experimental; the interfaces
      are subject to change.  Some example scripts are packaged, including
      STL pretty-printers for libstdc++.
    - Improved preprocessor macro support.
    - Non-stop debugging support (for 32-bit i386 only).  You can stop just
      one thread of interest while the others continue to run.
    - Improved tab completion, including C structure fields.
    - Faster remote debugging.
    - Compressed debug information support; the new "gold" linker can generate
      compressed debug sections.
    - New "find" command to search memory.
    - Native i386 debugger does not get confused about watchpoints when
      using "target remote" (Closes: #513678).
  * Build depend on zlib1g-dev and python-dev.

      appropriate.

  * New upstream code. Only change relevant on Linux: Patch by
    H.J. Lu so debugging of shared library works properly (That was
    the important patch motivating this upload).
    This release _is_ supposed to be the final gdb-4.17 (from the announce:
    'I wanted to make a "this is the release unless something is
    very wrong" release and then kick 4.17 out').

gdb (4.16.85-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Also remove gdb/doc/GDBvn.texi and config.log when cleaning up.
  * The following has been done by <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>:
  * TODO: this version of gdb uses an evil new version of libtool which
    forces -rpath. With lesstif, I got around this by replacing the libtool
    scripts with those from the Debian libtool package.
  * Use dynamic readline library.
  * Install with preserved timestamps.
  * Clean out .tab.c files missed by "make distclean", so the .diff.gz is
    smaller.
  * Clean out symlinks, so dpkg-source works after debian/rules build clean.
  * Several other minor clean-ups of the rules file.
  * Updated FSF address (lintian).
  * Bumped Standards-Version.
