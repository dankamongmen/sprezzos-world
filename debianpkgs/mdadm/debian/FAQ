Frequently asked questions -- Debian mdadm
==========================================

Also see /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.recipes.gz .

The latest version of this FAQ is available here:
  http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-mdadm/mdadm.git;a=blob;f=debian/FAQ;hb=HEAD

0. What does MD stand for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  MD is an abbreviation for "multiple device" (also often called "multi-
  disk"). The Linux MD implementation implements various strategies for
  combining multiple physical devices into single logical ones. The most
  common use case is commonly known as "Software RAID". Linux supports RAID
  levels 1, 4, 5, 6, and 10, as well as the "pseudo-redundant" RAID level 0.
  In addition, the MD implementation covers linear and multipath
  configurations.

  Most people refer to MD as RAID. Since the original name of the RAID
  configuration software is "md"adm, I chose to use MD consistently instead.

1. How do I overwrite ("zero") the superblock?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/mdX

  Note that this is a destructive operation. It does not actually delete any
  data, but the device will have lost its "authority". You cannot assemble the
  array with it anymore, and if you add the device to another array, the
  synchronisation process *will* *overwrite* all data on the device.

  Nevertheless, sometimes it is necessary to zero the superblock:

  - If you are reusing a disk that has been part of an array with an different
    superblock version and/or location. In this case you zero the superblock
    before you assemble the array, or add the device to an array.

  - If you are trying to prevent a device from being recognised as part of an
    array. Say for instance you are trying to change an array spanning sd[ab]1
    to sd[bc]1 (maybe because sda is failing or too slow), then automatic
    (scan) assembly will still recognise sda1 as a valid device. You can limit
    the devices to scan with the DEVICE keyword in the configuration file, but
    this may not be what you want. Instead, zeroing the superblock will
    (permanently) prevent a device from being considered as part of an array.

2. How do I change the preferred minor of an MD array (RAID)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  See item 12 in /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.recipes.gz and read the mdadm
  manpage (search for 'preferred').

3. How does mdadm determine which /dev/mdX or /dev/md/X to use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The logic used by mdadm to determine the device node name in the mdadm
  --examine output (which is used to generate mdadm.conf) depends on several
  factors. Here's how mdadm determines it:

  It first checks the superblock version of a given array (or each array in
  turn when iterating all of them). Run

    mdadm --detail /dev/mdX | sed -ne 's,.*Version : ,,p'

  to determine the superblock version of a running array, or

    mdadm --examine /dev/sdXY | sed -ne 's,.*Version : ,,p'

  to determine the superblock version from a component device of an array.

  Version 0 superblocks (00.90.XX)
  ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    You need to know the preferred minor number stored in the superblock,
    so run either of

      mdadm --detail /dev/mdX | sed -ne 's,.*Preferred Minor : ,,p'
      mdadm --examine /dev/sdXY | sed -ne 's,.*Preferred Minor : ,,p'

    Let's call the resulting number MINOR. Also see FAQ 2 further up.

    Given MINOR, mdadm will output /dev/md<MINOR> if the device node
    /dev/md<MINOR> exists.
    Otherwise, it outputs /dev/md/<MINOR>

  Version 1 superblocks (01.XX.XX)
  ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    Version 1 superblocks actually seem to ignore preferred minors and instead
    use the value of the name field in the superblock. Unless specified
    explicitly during creation (-N|--name) the name is determined from the
    device name used, using the following regexp: 's,/dev/md/?(.*),$1,', thus:

      /dev/md0     -> 0
      /dev/md/0    -> 0
      /dev/md_d0   -> _d0 (d0 in later versions)
      /dev/md/d0   -> d0
      /dev/md/name -> name
      (/dev/name does not seem to work)

    mdadm will append the name to '/dev/md/', so it will always output device
    names under the /dev/md/ directory. Newer versions can create a symlink
    from /dev/mdX. See the symlinks option in mdadm.con(5) and mdadm(8).

    If you want to change the name, you can do so during assembly:

      mdadm -A -U name -N newname /dev/mdX /dev/sd[abc]X

    I know this all sounds inconsistent and upstream has some work to do.
    We're on it.

4. Which RAID level should I use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Please read /usr/share/doc/mdadm/RAID5_versus_RAID10.txt.gz .

  Many people seem to prefer RAID4/5/6 because it makes more efficient use of
  space. For example, if you have disks of size X, then in order to get 2X
  storage, you need 3 disks for RAID5, but 4 if you use RAID10 or RAID1+0 (or
  RAID6).

  This gain in usable space comes at a price: performance; RAID1/10 can be up
  to four times faster than RAID4/5/6.

  At the same time, however, RAID4/5/6 provide somewhat better redundancy in
  the event of two failing disks. In a RAID10 configuration, if one disk is
  already dead, the RAID can only survive if any of the two disks in the other
  RAID1 array fails, but not if the second disk in the degraded RAID1 array
  fails (see next item, 4b). A RAID6 across four disks can cope with any two
  disks failing. However, RAID6 is noticeably slower than RAID5. RAID5 and
  RAID4 do not differ much, but can only handle single-disk failures.

  If you can afford the extra disks (storage *is* cheap these days), I suggest
  RAID1/10 over RAID4/5/6. If you don't care about performance but need as
  much space as possible, go with RAID4/5/6, but make sure to have backups.
  Heck, make sure to have backups whatever you do.

  Let it be said, however, that I thoroughly regret putting my primary
  workstation on RAID5. Anything disk-intensive brings the system to its
  knees; I will have to migrate to RAID10 at one point.

4b. Can a 4-disk RAID10 survive two disk failures?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I am assuming that you are talking about a setup with two copies of each
  block, so --layout=near2/far2/offset2:

  In two thirds of the cases, yes[0], and it does not matter which layout you
  use. When you assemble 4 disks into a RAID10, you essentially stripe a RAID0
  across two RAID1, so the four disks A,B,C,D become two pairs: A,B and C,D.
  If A fails, the RAID10 can only survive if the second failing disk is either
  C or D; If B fails, your array is dead.

  Thus, if you see a disk failing, replace it as soon as possible!

  If you need to handle two failing disks out of a set of four, you have to
  use RAID6, or store more than two copies of each block (see the --layout
  option in the mdadm(8) manpage).

  See also question 18 further down.

  0. it's actually (n-2)/(n-1), where n is the number of disks. I am not
     a mathematician, see http://aput.net/~jheiss/raid10/, which gives the
     chance of *failure* as 1/(n-1), so the chance of success is 1-1/(n-1), or
     (n-2)/(n-1), or 2/3 in the four disk example.
     (Thanks to Per Olofsson for clarifying this in #493577).

5. How to convert RAID5 to RAID10?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  To convert RAID5 to RAID10, you need a spare disk (either a spare, forth
  disk in the array, or a new one). Then you remove the spare and one of the
  three disks from the RAID5, create a degraded RAID10 across them, create
  the filesystem and copy the data (or do a raw copy), then add the other two
  disks to the new RAID10. However, mdadm cannot assemble a RAID10 with 50%
  missing devices the way you might like it:

    mdadm --create -l 10 -n4 -pn2 /dev/md1 /dev/sd[cd] missing missing

  For reasons that may be answered by question 20 further down, mdadm actually
  cares about the order of devices you give it. If you intersperse the missing
  keywords with the physical drives, it should work:

    mdadm --create -l 10 -n4 -pn2 /dev/md1 /dev/sdc missing /dev/sdd missing

  or even

    mdadm --create -l 10 -n4 -pn2 /dev/md1 missing /dev/sd[cd] missing

  Also see item (4b) further up, and this thread:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-raid&m=116004333406395&w=2

6. What is the difference between RAID1+0 and RAID10?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  RAID1+0 is a form of RAID in which a RAID0 is striped across two RAID1
  arrays. To assemble it, you create two RAID1 arrays and then create a RAID0
  array with the two md arrays.

  The Linux kernel provides the RAID10 level to do pretty much exactly the
  same for you, but with greater flexibility (and somewhat improved
  performance). While RAID1+0 makes sense with 4 disks, RAID10 can be
  configured to work with only 3 disks. Also, RAID10 has a little less
  overhead than RAID1+0, which has data pass the md layer twice.

  I prefer RAID10 over RAID1+0.

6b. What's the difference between RAID1+0 and RAID0+1?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In short: RAID1+0 concatenates two mirrored arrays while RAID0+1 mirrors two
  concatenated arrays. However, the two are also often switched.

  The linux MD driver supports RAID10, which is equivalent to the above
  RAID1+0 definition.

  RAID1+0/10 has a greater chance to survive two disk failures, its
  performance suffers less when in degraded state, and it resyncs faster after
  replacing a failed disk.

  See http://aput.net/~jheiss/raid10/ for more details.

7. Which RAID10 layout scheme should I use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  RAID10 gives you the choice between three ways of laying out the blocks on
  the disk. Assuming a simple 4 drive setup with 2 copies of each block, then
  if A,B,C are data blocks, a,b their parts, and 1,2 denote their copies, the
  following would be a classic RAID1+0 where 1,2 and 3,4 are RAID0 pairs
  combined into a RAID1:

  near=2 would be (this is the classic RAID1+0)

    hdd1  Aa1 Ba1 Ca1
    hdd2  Aa2 Ba2 Ca2
    hdd3  Ab1 Bb1 Cb1
    hdd4  Ab2 Bb2 Cb2

  offset=2 would be

    hdd1  Aa1 Bb2 Ca1 Db2
    hdd2  Ab1 Aa2 Cb1 Ca2
    hdd3  Ba1 Ab2 Da1 Cb2
    hdd4  Bb1 Ba2 Db1 Da2

  far=2 would be

    hdd1  Aa1 Ca1  .... Bb2 Db2
    hdd2  Ab1 Cb1  .... Aa2 Ca2
    hdd3  Ba1 Da1  .... Ab2 Cb2
    hdd4  Bb1 Db1  .... Ba2 Da2

  Where the second set start half-way through the drives.

  The advantage of far= is that you can easily spread a long sequential read
  across the drives.  The cost is more seeking for writes. offset= can
  possibly get similar benefits with large enough chunk size. Neither upstream
  nor the package maintainer have tried to understand all the implications of
  that layout. It was added simply because it is a supported layout in DDF and
  DDF support is a goal.

8. (One of) my RAID arrays is busy and cannot be stopped. What gives?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  It is perfectly normal for mdadm to report the array with the root
  filesystem to be busy on shutdown. The reason for this is that the root
  filesystem must be mounted to be able to stop the array (or otherwise
  /sbin/mdadm does not exist), but to stop the array, the root filesystem
  cannot be mounted. Catch 22. The kernel actually stops the array just before
  halting, so it's all well.

  If mdadm cannot stop other arrays on your system, check that these arrays
  aren't used anymore. Common causes for busy/locked arrays are:

    * The array contains a mounted filesystem (check the `mount' output)
    * The array is used as a swap backend (check /proc/swaps)
    * The array is used by the device-mapper (check with `dmsetup')
      * LVM
      * dm-crypt
      * EVMS
    * The array contains a swap partition used for suspend-to-ram
      (check /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume)
    * The array is used by a process (check with `lsof')

9. Should I use RAID0 (or linear)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  No. Unless you know what you're doing and keep backups, or use it for data
  that can be lost.

9b. Why not?
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  RAID0 has zero redundancy. If you stripe a RAID0 across X disks, you
  increase the likelyhood of complete loss of the filesystem by a factor of X.

  The same applies to LVM by the way.

  If you want/must used LVM or RAID0, stripe it across RAID1 arrays
  (RAID10/RAID1+0, or LVM on RAID1), and keep backups!

10. Can I cancel a running array check (checkarray)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  See the -x option in the `/usr/share/mdadm/checkarray --help` output.

11. mdadm warns about duplicate/similar superblocks; what gives?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In certain configurations, especially if your last partition extends all the
  way to the end of the disk, mdadm may display a warning like:

    mdadm: WARNING /dev/hdc3 and /dev/hdc appear to have very similar
    superblocks. If they are really different, please --zero the superblock on
    one. If they are the same or overlap, please remove one from the DEVICE
    list in mdadm.conf.

  There are two ways to solve this:

  (a) recreate the arrays with version-1 superblocks, which is not always an
      option -- you cannot yet upgrade version-0 to version-1 superblocks for
      existing arrays.

  (b) instead of 'DEVICE partitions', list exactly those devices that are
      components of MD arrays on your system. So in the above example:

        - DEVICE partitions
        + DEVICE /dev/hd[ab]* /dev/hdc[123]

12. mdadm -E / mkconf report different arrays with the same device
    name / minor number. What gives?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In almost all cases, mdadm updates the super-minor field in an array's
  superblock when assembling the array. It does *not* do this for RAID0
  arrays. Thus, you may end up seeing something like this when you run
  mdadm -E or mkconf:

    ARRAY /dev/md0 level=raid0 num-devices=2 UUID=abcd...
    ARRAY /dev/md0 level=raid1 num-devices=2 UUID=dcba...

  Note how the two arrays have different UUIDs but both appear as /dev/md0.

  The solution in this case is to explicitly tell mdadm to update the
  superblock of the RAID0 array. Assuming that the RAID0 array in the above
  example should really be /dev/md1:

    mdadm --stop /dev/md1
    mdadm --assemble --update=super-minor --uuid=abcd... /dev/md1

  See question 2 of this FAQ, and also http://bugs.debian.org/386315 and
  recipe #12 in README.recipes .

13. Can a MD array be partitioned?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Since kernel 2.6.28, MD arrays can be partitioned like any other block
  device.

  Prior to 2.6.28, for a MD array to be able to hold partitions, it must be
  created as a "partitionable array", using the configuration auto=part on the
  command line or in the configuration file, or by using the standard naming
  scheme (md_d* or md/d*) for partitionable arrays:

    mdadm --create --auto=yes ... /dev/md_d0 ...
    # see mdadm(8) manpage about the values of the --auto keyword

14. When would I partition an array?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This answer by Doug Ledford is shamelessly adapted from [0] (with
  permission):

    First, not all MD types make sense to be split up, e.g. multipath. For
    those types, when a disk fails, the *entire* disk is considered to have
    failed, but with different arrays you won't switch over to the next path
    until each MD array has attempted to access the bad path. This can have
    obvious bad consequences for certain array types that do automatic
    failover from one port to another (you can end up getting the array in
    a loop of switching ports repeatedly to satisfy the fact that one array
    failed over during a path down, then the path came back up, and another
    array stayed on the old path because it didn't send any commands during
    the path down time period).

    Second, convenience. Assume you have a 6 disk RAID5 array. If a disk
    fails and you are using a partitioned MD array, then all the partitions on
    the disk will already be handled without using that disk. No need to
    manually fail any still active array members from other arrays.

    Third, safety. Again with the raid5 array. If you use multiple arrays on
    a single disk, and that disk fails, but it only failed on one array, then
    you now need to manually fail that disk from the other arrays before
    shutting down or hot swapping the disk. Generally speaking, that's not
    a big deal, but people do occasionally have fat finger syndrome and this
    is a good opportunity for someone to accidentally fail the wrong disk, and
    when you then go to remove the disk you create a two disk failure instead
    of one and now you are in real trouble.

    Forth, to respond to what you wrote about independent of each other --
    part of the reason why you partition. I would argue that's not true. If
    your goal is to salvage as much use from a failing disk as possible, then
    OK. But, generally speaking, people that have something of value on their
    disks don't want to salvage any part of a failing disk, they want that
    disk gone and replaced immediately. There simply is little to no value in
    an already malfunctioning disk. They're too cheap and the data stored on
    them too valuable to risk loosing something in an effort to further
    utilize broken hardware. This of course is written with the understanding
    that the latest MD RAID code will do read error rewrites to compensate for
    minor disk issues, so anything that will throw a disk out of an array is
    more than just a minor sector glitch.

15. How can I start a dirty degraded array?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A degraded array (e.g. a RAID5 with only two disks) that has not been
  properly stopped cannot be assembled just like that; mdadm will refuse and
  complain about a "dirty degraded array", for good reasons.

  The solution might be to force-assemble it, and then to start it. Please see
  recipes 4 and 4b of /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.recipes.gz and make sure you
  know what you're doing.

16. How can I influence the speed with which an array is resynchronised?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  For each array, the MD subsystem exports parameters governing the
  synchronisation speed via sysfs. The values are in kB/sec.

    /sys/block/mdX/md/sync_speed     -- the current speed
    /sys/block/mdX/md/sync_speed_max -- the maximum speed
    /sys/block/mdX/md/sync_speed_min -- the guaranteed minimum speed

17. When I create a new array, why does it resynchronise at first?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  See the mdadm(8) manpage:
    When creating a RAID5 array, mdadm will automatically create a degraded
    array with an extra spare drive. This is because building the spare into
    a degraded array is in general faster than resyncing the parity on
    a non-degraded, but not clean, array. This feature can be over-ridden with
    the --force option.

  This also applies to RAID levels 4 and 6.

  It does not make much sense for RAID levels 1 and 10 and can thus be
  overridden with the --force and --assume-clean options, but it is not
  recommended. Read the manpage.

18. How many failed disks can a RAID10 handle?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  (see also question 4b)

  The following table shows how many disks you can lose and still have an
  operational array. In some cases, you *can* lose more than the given number
  of disks, but there is no guarantee that the array survives. Thus, the
  following is the guaranteed number of failed disks a RAID10 array survives
  and the maximum number of failed disks the array can (but is not guaranteed
  to) handle, given the number of disks used and the number of data block
  copies. Note that 2 copies means original + 1 copy. Thus, if you only have
  one copy (the original), you cannot handle any failures.

                  1            2            3            4    (# of copies)
        1        0/0          0/0          0/0          0/0
        2        0/0          1/1          1/1          1/1
        3        0/0          1/1          2/2          2/2
        4        0/0          1/2          2/2          3/3
        5        0/0          1/2          2/2          3/3
        6        0/0          1/3          2/3          3/3
        7        0/0          1/3          2/3          3/3
        8        0/0          1/4          2/3          3/4
  (# of disks)

  Note: I have not really verified the above information. Please don't count
  on it. If a disk fails, replace it as soon as possible. Corrections welcome.

19. What should I do if a disk fails?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Replace it as soon as possible:

    mdadm --remove /dev/md0 /dev/sda1
    halt
    <replace disk and start the machine>
    mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sda1

20. So how do I find out which other disk(s) can fail without killing the
    array?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Did you read the previous question and its answer?

  For cases when you have two copies of each block, the question is easily
  answered by looking at the output of /proc/mdstat. For instance on a four
  disk array:

    md3 : active raid10 sdg7[3] sde7[0] sdh7[2] sdf7[1]

  you know that sde7/sdf7 form one pair and sdg7/sgh7 the other.

  If sdh now fails, this will become

    md3 : active raid10 sdg7[3] sde7[0] sdh7[4](F) sdf7[1]

  So now the second pair is broken; the array could take another failure in
  the first pair, but if sdg now also fails, you're history.

  Now go and read question 19.

  For cases with more copies per block, it becomes more complicated. Let's
  think of a seven disk array with three copies:

    md5 : active raid10 sdg7[6] sde7[4] sdb7[5] sdf7[2] sda7[3] sdc7[1] sdd7[0]

  Each mirror now has 7/3 = 2.33 disks to it, so in order to determine groups,
  you need to round up. Note how the disks are arranged in increasing order of
  their indices (the number in brackes in /proc/mdstat):

  disk:     -sdd7-  -sdc7-  -sdf7-  -sda7-  -sde7-  -sdb7-  -sdg7-
  group:    [      one       ][      two       ][     three      ]

  Basically this means that after two disk failed, you need to make sure that
  the third failed disk doesn't destroy all copies of any given block. And
  that's not always easy as it depends on the layout chosen: whether the
  blocks are near (same offset within each group), far (spread apart in a way
  to maximise the mean distance), or offset (offset by size/n within each
  block).

  I'll leave it up to you to figure things out. Now go read question 19.

21. Why does the kernel speak of 'resync' when using checkarray?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Please see README.checkarray and
  http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-raid@vger.kernel.org/msg04835.html .

  In short: it's a bug. checkarray is actually not a resync, but the kernel
  does not distinguish between them.

22. Can I prioritise the sync process and sync certain arrays before others?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Upon start, md will resynchronise any unclean arrays, starting in somewhat
  random order. Sometimes it's desirable to sync e.g. /dev/md3 first (because
  it's the most important), but while /dev/md1 is synchronising, /dev/md3 will
  be DELAYED (see /proc/mdstat; only if they share the same physical
  components.

  It is possible to delay the synchronisation via /sys:

    echo idle >/sys/block/md1/md/sync_action

  This will cause md1 to go idle and md to synchronise md3 (or whatever is
  queued next; repeat the above for other devices if necessary). md will also
  realise that md1 is still not in sync and queue it for resynchronisation,
  so it will sync automatically when its turn has come.

23. mdadm's init script fails because it cannot find any arrays. What gives?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  If you don't have any arrays on your system, then mdadm's init script will
  fail to assemble them and print a warning. If you don't like that, disable
  AUTOSTART in /etc/default/mdadm.

24. What happened to mdrun? How do I replace it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  mdrun used to be the sledgehammer approach to assembling arrays. It has
  accumulated several problems over the years (e.g. #354705) and thus has been
  deprecated and removed with the 2.6.7-2 version of this package.

  If you are still using mdrun, please ensure that you have a valid
  /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf file (run /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf --generate to get
  one), and run

    mdadm --assemble --scan --auto=yes

  instead of mdrun.

  Or make use of /usr/share/mdadm/startall .

25. Why are my arrays marked auto-read-only in /proc/mdstat?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Arrays are kept read-only until the first write occurs. This allows md to
  skip lengthy resynchronisation for arrays that have not been properly shut
  down, but which also not have changed.

26. Why doesn't mdadm find arrays specified in the config file and causes the
    boot to fail?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  My boot process dies at an early stage and drops me into the busybox shell.
  The last relevant output seems to be from mdadm and is something like

    "/dev/md2 does not exist"

  or

    "No devices listed in conf file found"

  Why does mdadm break my system?

  Short answer: It doesn't, the underlying devices aren't yet available yet
  when mdadm runs during the early boot process.

  Long answer: It doesn't. but the drivers of those devices incorrectly
  communicate to the kernel that the devices are ready, when in fact they are
  not. I consider this a bug in those drivers. Please consider reporting it.

  Workaround: there is nothing mdadm can or will do against this. Fortunately
  though, initramfs provides a method, documented at
  http://wiki.debian.org/InitramfsDebug. Please append rootdelay=10 to the
  kernel command line and try if the boot now works.
