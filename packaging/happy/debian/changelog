happy (1.18.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.18.4
    - New feature: EBNF-style paramterized macros, thanks to
      Iavor Diatchki.
    - Works with Cabal 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6
    - A few minor bugfixes
      + Manpage now correctly specifies options required for -d to work
        (Closes: #326952)
  * debian/control, debian/copyright, debian/rules: Adopt for Debian Haskell
    Group, add myself to Uploaders and remove Ian Lynagh (Igloo). Thanks for
    your previous maintainership. Add VCS information.
  * debian/control: Update long description
  * debian/control: Standards-version 3.8.3
    - Section: haskell
    - Add debian/README.source for new patchsys
  * debian/rules, debian/control, debian/happy.*, debian/compat: Fairly major
    rewrite to use cdbs and hlibrary.mk
  * debian/control, debian/patches/templates_path.patch, debian/rules: Add
    quilt patchsys and patch Setup.lhs to install templates in out/ directory.
    They are usually installed in the build root which means there is no easy
    way to install them all at once.
  * debian/rules, debian/control: Upstream doesn't ship doc/configure required
    for the doc build - use autoconf to generate it at build-time. Requires a
    build-dep on autoconf.
