  * Update package short description, openexr does not contain a viewer.
    Closes: #471783
  * Use 3.0 (quilt) source format.
  * Re-enable doc-base support. At least dhelp works without problems.

  * The latter three changes add support for build-arch target, fixing FTBFS.
    Closes: #666297

    testsuite is run twice. (Once for build and binary).
  * Add myself to uploaders, remove Cyril. (Thanks for you work!)
  * Empty dependency_libs in libtool la file.
  * Fix doc-base ids. (lowercase, no underscore.)
  * Drop Section: graphics from binary package stanza in debian/control.
  * Fix typo mutiple in exrmaketiled.1.

openexr (1.6.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopt the package within pkg-phototools (Closes: #494877):
     - Thanks to Adeodato Simó et al. for having taken care of it until
       now!
     - Set Maintainer to the group.
     - Set Uploaders to myself.
     - Update Vcs-{Git,Browser}.
     - Remove XS-X-Collab-Maint field, no longer relevant. Patches are
       still welcome, though!
  * Switch to debhelper 7:
     - Bump debian/compat to 7.
     - Version the B-D on debhelper: >= 7.0.50 to allow the use of
       overrides.
     - Specify some overrides to tweak as needed for the build:
        - dh_auto_configure: pass the --with-openexr flag to configure
          script.
        - dh_auto_test: don't run “check” on arm and ia64 for now, and
          bypass dh_auto_test due to bad target detection.
        - dh_compress: no longer compress .h/.cpp examples.
        - dh_link: needed since libopenexr-dev's and openexr's /us/s/d
          directories are symlinks to libopenexr6's one.
        - dh_makeshlibs: keep on using -V.
        - dh_installdeb: add a call to dh_buildinfo to keep on storing the
          versions of packages installed during the build.
     - Specify some targets:
        - build and clean to handle patching/unpatching and
          updating/cleaning config.{guess,sub}.
  * Now compress PDF documentation. Any sane PDF viewer should be able to
    handle decompression.
  * Remove .gitignore file.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to all binaries.
  * Bump Standards-Version from 3.7.3 to 3.8.1 (no changes needed).

openexr (1.6.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #405783, #437494)
    + New soname: rename package to libopenexr6, and drop old conflicts and
      replaces.
    + Build-depend on libilmbase-dev (Imath, Half et al. are now there). Make
      libopenexr-dev depend on it as well, and drop bits from description that
      allude to these other libraries.

  * The exrdisplay binary is no longer shipped by upstream in the openexr
    tarball (it has moved to openexr_viewers): do not install it, nor its
    manpage, drop build-dependencies on libfltk1.1-dev and OpenGL stuff, and
    README.Debian as well, since they all were only needed for this program.

  * Adding myself as an uploader; add VCS-Bzr header.

  * Do some housekeeping:
    + update debian/watch.
    + bump debian/compat to 5.
    + use ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version}.
    + bump Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no changes needed).
    + use a Homepage header, instead of the pseudo-header.

  * Run tests after building.

  * Drop all patches, unnecessary.
