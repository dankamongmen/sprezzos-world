    * searching in PDFS using 'wide' fonts now works reasonably well

    * the lua "pdf" table code was wrong

luatex (0.10.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * luatex is in beta stage, name it already luatex without -snapshot
  * add a patch zlib-version-check-fix which stops luatex from breaking
    since zlibVersion() and ZLIB_VERSION return different strings. It
    makes luatex only compare the first 5 chars.
  * do not compress .pdf documents, they are already compressed
  * small fixes to the man page (texlua instead of luatexlua)
  * remove code in postinst and postrm for the texmf.d snippet removal
  * revert luatexlib.mk to (quasi) 0.10.1 version, otherwise compiling
    with --with-system-zlib breaks
