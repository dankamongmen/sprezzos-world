# Short-Description: powerful, efficient, and scalable Mail Transport Agent
# Description:       Sendmail is an alternative Mail Transport Agent (MTA)
#                    for Debian. It is suitable for handling sophisticated
#                    mail configurations, although this means that its
#                    configuration can also be complex. Fortunately, simple
#                    thing can be done easily, and complex thing are possible,
#                    even if not easily understood ;)  Sendmail is the *ONLY*
#                    MTA with a Turing complete language to control *ALL*
#                    aspects of delivery!
