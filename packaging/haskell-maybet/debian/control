Description: Haskell MaybeT monad transformer - GHC libraries
 MaybeT is a Haskell monad transformer that adds Maybe semantics to an
 existing monad, making it able to fail (i.e. return Nothing) or be
 successful (return the result wrapped in a Just).
 .
 If you don't know what a Haskell monad is, you can just ignore this package.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC.
