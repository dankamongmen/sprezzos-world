It seems that commit bc5c54c987f548505a3877e8a0e460abe0b2a081 introduced some linux specific things...

I dug around the OSX documentation and fcntl.h header file and it seems that UTIME_OMIT, UTIME_NOW, AT_FDCWD and AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW aren't defined (at least on OSX). I suspect the BSD's in general will have problems compiling git-annex.
