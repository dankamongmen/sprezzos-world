mlocate (0.21.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Adeodato Simó ]
  * Remove the "mlocate" group on purge. No other files than the mlocate.db
    database should belong to said group, and since it also gets removed on
    purge, it should be safe to remove the group as well. (Closes: #520017)

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Adopt package.  (Closes: #548351)
  * Add fuse.glusterfs to PRUNEFS.  (Closes: #535170)
  * Add fuse.sshfs to PRUNEFS.  (Closes: #526262)
  * Stop giving out an error when not running updatedb because we are on
    battery.  (Closes: #519188)
  * Remove XS-X-Collab-Maint from debian/control, it seems it didn't take
    off

mlocate (0.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Fixes various typos in man pages. (Closes: #465199, #465200)

  * Temporarily disable the test suite, since it fails when run with $CWD
    matching "*d/b*" (which happens on buildds).

  * Add paragraph to the description mentioning how installing mlocate changes
    /usr/bin/locate via alternatives, and that it won't work until the daily
    script is run at least once. Thanks Stefano Zacchiroli for the suggestion.
    (Closes: #456150, #456151)

  * Call dpkg-statoverride --remove in postrm. (Closes: #468231)

  * Fix typo in description. (Closes: #453019)

mlocate (0.18-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.

  * Only run the test suite when there is no /etc/updatedb.conf file, or
    its syntax is compatible with mlocate's updatedb -- otherwise all tests
    involving updatedb fail due to bad syntax. Upstream agrees there should
    be a --config-file option. (Closes: #451997)

  * Lower conflicts against findutils to (<= 4.2.31-1).

mlocate (0.18-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #435787)

  * Handle /usr/bin/locate, /usr/bin/updatedb and locate.1 with alternatives
    (manpage for mlocate's updatedb is in section 8, so no need to).

  * Create a "mlocate" group, and make the locate binary setgid on postinst
    (with dpkg-statoverride).

  * Run the cron.daily script under the "idle" ionice(1) priority.
    Via #448398.
