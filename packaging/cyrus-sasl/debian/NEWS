  * Configuration of SQL engine backends have changed from database
    specific configuration (e.g. 'mysql') to generic 'sql' auxprop
    plugin.
  
    You will need to change your configuration f.e. from:
  
        auxprop_plugin: mysql
  
    to
  
        auxprop_plugin: sql
        sql_engine: mysql
  
    Also the SQL query (if used) needs to have '%u' replaced with '%u@%r'
    because now user and realm is provided separately.
