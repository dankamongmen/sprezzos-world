cpphs (0.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compile with GHC on all platforms so we don't get the file encoding

    build-dep choices.

cpphs (0.7-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.

    Change build dependency order to prefer hugs over ghc6 since that is
    the only alternative that currently is installable.
    This also has as effect that the libgmp3 dependency gets dropped.
