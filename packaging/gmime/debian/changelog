gmime2.4 (2.4.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * libgmime2.4-cil: Section is cli-mono according to the override.
  * debian/control.in: Fix typo in package description. Closes: #557689.

  [ Mirco Bauer ]
  * New upstream release
  * debian/control:
    + Versioned monodoc-base build-dep to >= 2.0 as mdoc is needed from that,
      fixes FTBFS. (Closes: #558466)
    + Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes needed).
    + Replaced monodoc-manual dependency with monodoc-browser | monodoc-viewer
      as monodoc-base uses now dpkg-triggers for updating the indexes.
  * debian/control
    debian/rules:
    + Bumped mono-devel build-dep to >= 2.4.2.3 as we use mono-csc compiler
      of it.
  * debian/rules:
    + Bumped shlibs to 2.4.11
  * debian/patches/fix_gmime-sharp_dllmap.patch:
    + Fixed DLL map so it invokes libgmime-2.4.so.2 instead of .so.2.4.11
      which fixes the missing binary dependency on the libgime-2.4-2 package.
  * debian/control:
    + Added ${misc:Depends} to all binary packages.

gmime2.4 (2.4.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:

  * libgmime-2.4-doc.doc-base:
    + Changed Document to gmime2.4 so it can be installed at the same time
      with libgmime-2.0-2-doc (gmime). (Closes: #526483)

 -- Mirco Bauer <meebey@debian.org>  Mon, 11 May 2009 00:29:36 +0200

gmime2.4 (2.4.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Here we go, 4th attempt to get build && binary-arch working

    + Only generate monodoc API docs if the assembly was compiled, fixes FTBFS.

 -- Mirco Bauer <meebey@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Apr 2009 21:24:31 +0200

  * Args, this is my 3rd attempt to get build + binary-arch working for

gmime2.4 (2.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

    + Moved cli-common-dev build-dep to Build-Depends-Indep.
  * debian/rules:
    + Removed explicit --enable-mono from configure call and let the
      auto-detection do it's work. This makes arch:any vs arch:any + arch:all
      builds much simpler. (Closes: #525664)

 -- Mirco Bauer <meebey@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Apr 2009 22:44:40 +0200

gmime2.4 (2.4.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

    + Enhanced package short descriptions. (Closes: #493502)

 -- Mirco Bauer <meebey@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Apr 2009 11:21:38 +0200
