libpthread-stubs (0.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Build for multiarch.  Closes: #632555.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Point Vcs-{Git,Browser} at collab-maint.
  * Remove Jamey Sharp from Uploaders (closes: #568281).
  * Remove Josh Triplett from Uploaders.
  * Use dh instead of cdbs.  In the process (and in order to be able to test
    it), make the package actually buildable on hurd, which doesn't have the
    stubs in libc, but whose libc.so pulls in libpthread-stubs.so, defeating
    our configure checks; so make the build find an empty libpthread-stubs.so
    instead of the system one.
  
  [ Samuel Thibault ]
  * Fix pthread_exit prototype (closes: #622148).
