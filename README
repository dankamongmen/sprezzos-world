	wget
	dpkg-dev
	autoconf-archive
	pkg-config
	uscan
	libwww-perl

III. Package notes

cups -- will break in the presence of firewalling or port unavailability
eglibc -- have yet to successfully build due to unit test failure of
          unknown cause (eintr.c test)
libxml2 -- parallel builds appear to be broken.
libav -- parallel builds are broken
