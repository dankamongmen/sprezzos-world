libsepol (2.0.38-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Handle the init=/bin/sh case in postinst    
    The previous tests did not check to see if the process running with
    process id 1 was actually /sbin/init, or if /dev/initctl was present to
    be talked to.
  * Note that checklibs fails with a spurious error on IA64.
  * Urgency high, since this is causing all kinds of failures in
    situations were init=/bin/sh, like qemubuilder.

libsepol (2.0.38-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     Check last offset in the module package against the file size.
     Reported by Manoj Srivastava for bug filed by Max Kellermann.
  * Bug fix: "out of memory", thanks to Max Kellermann   (Closes: #543915).
  * Bug fix: "/etc/.initctl: ENOENT breaks debootstrap on kfreebsd",
    thanks to Philipp Kern. This package has been removed from all !linux
    architectures, and no longer builds on them.         (Closes: #543938).
  * First cut at providing symbols files.
  *  Check for extra libraries and shlib version numbers.  Unless there is
    a nocheck option in the deb build options variable, now we look to see
    if there are extra libraries we have linked to. Might need to back
    this out later, if this causes problems on the buildds.

  * [f7ba986]: [libsepol]: common code update: Make sure the jobserver is
    no killed.
  * [b8570c3]: [libsepol] only run init -u when not in a chroot
    This fix was done 10 days ago, I just forgot to upload the new
    version; and then I was wondering how the bugs could possibly happen,
    since the code in front of me would prevent that.
    Bug fix: "postinst script fails in chroot environment", thanks to
    Ondřej Surý (Closes: #543347).
    Bug fix: "telinit doesn&#39;t work inside chroot", thanks to Sylvain

    * Allow dontaudits to be turned off during policy expansion from
      Joshua Brindle.
    * Fix sepol_context_clone to handle a NULL context correctly.
      This happens for e.g. semanage_fcontext_set_con(sh, fcontext, NULL)
      to set the file context entry to "<<none>>".
    * Merged error handling patch from Eamon Walsh.
  * The cross building support in Debian has been rewritten to stop
    overriding the CC  variable to $(MAKE) in order to correctly support
    those packages that build internal tools with the native compiler
    during the build. This means that other packages that assume that CC
    will be overridden by the cross-compiling build scripts now fail to
    build. The patch is simply to set CC to $(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)-gcc only
    if a cross-build is detected. The solution was proposed by  Neil
    Williams, but has been modified to be more generally applicable.
                                                          Closes: Bug#448014
  * The API was added to in this release, which means we need a shlibs
    bump. The soname has not changed.

  * This fix is in reference to Bug#408278. In the postinst, we now use
    telinit u, instead of plain old init u, if telinit is available.
    Using init directly is bad form, according to sysvinit maintainer.
  * Make the dev package depend on the exact ${binary:Version}, not the
    ${Source-Version}, which should make this package friendlier to
    binNMUs.

libsepol (1.12.26-2) unstable; urgency=low

libsepol (1.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "libsepol: please include a pkg-config file", thanks to
    Guillem Jover In Debian, dpkg compiles in libselinux statically -- in
    order to prevent dependency loops. Now, as libselinux acquired a build
    time dependency on libsepol, automated dpkg builds failed -- since
    there was no way for packages to detect the transitive dependencies
    when linking statically. This patch fixes that issue -- by generating
    a .pc file to be used with pkg-config.                  (Closes: #348947).

    * Added sepol_policy_file_set_handle interface to associate
      a handle with a policy file.
    * Added handle argument to policydb_from_image/to_image.
    * Added sepol_module_package_set_file_contexts interface.
    * Dropped sepol_module_package_create_file interface.
    * Reworked policydb_read/write, policydb_from_image/to_image,
      and sepol_module_package_read/write to use callback-based error
      reporting system rather than DEBUG.
    * Reworked link_packages, link_modules, and expand_module to use
      callback-based error reporting system rather than error buffering.
    * Merged conditional expression mapping fix in the module linking
      code from Joshua Brindle.
    * Hid sepol_module_package type definition, and added get interfaces.
    * Merged new callback-based error reporting system from Ivan
      Gyurdiev.
    * Merged support for require blocks inside conditionals from
      Joshua Brindle (Tresys).
    * Fixed use of policydb_from_image/to_image to ensure proper
      init of policydb.
    * Isolated policydb internal headers under <sepol/policydb/*.h>.
      These headers should only be used by users of the static libsepol.
      Created new <sepol/policydb.h> with new public types and interfaces
      for shared libsepol.
      Created new <sepol/module.h> with public types and interfaces moved
      or wrapped from old module.h, link.h, and expand.h, adjusted for
      new public types for policydb and policy_file.
      Added public interfaces to libsepol.map.
      Some implementation changes visible to users of the static libsepol:
      1) policydb_read no longer calls policydb_init.
         Caller must do so first.
      2) policydb_init no longer takes policy_type argument.
         Caller must set policy_type separately.
      3) expand_module automatically enables the global branch.
         Caller no longer needs to do so.
      4) policydb_write uses the policy_type and policyvers from the
         policydb itself, and sepol_set_policyvers() has been removed.
    * Merged function renaming and static cleanup from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged bug fix for check_assertions handling of no assertions
      from Joshua Brindle (Tresys).
    * Merged iterate patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged MLS in modules patch from Joshua Brindle (Tresys).
    * Merged pointer typedef elimination patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged user list function, new mls functions, and bugfix patch
      from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged sepol_get_num_roles fix from Karl MacMillan (Tresys).
    * Merged bug fix patches from Joshua Brindle (Tresys).
    * Merged boolean record and memory leak fix patches from Ivan
      Gyurdiev.
    * Merged interface record patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged fix for sepol_enable/disable_debug from Ivan
      Gyurdiev.
    * Merged stddef.h patch and debug conversion patch from
      Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Fixed expand_avtab and expand_cond_av_list to keep separate
      entries with identical keys but different enabled flags.

      * Changed to treat all type conflicts as fatal errors.
      * Merged several error handling fixes from
        Serge Hallyn (IBM).  Bugs found by Coverity.
      * Fixed further memory leaks found by valgrind.
      * Fixed several memory leaks found by valgrind.
      * Fixed empty list test in cond_write_av_list.  Bug found by
        Coverity, reported by Serge Hallyn (IBM).
      * Merged patch to policydb_write to check errors
        when writing the type->attribute reverse map from
        Serge Hallyn (IBM).  Bug found by Coverity.

      * Fixed use of uninitialized data by expand_avtab_node by
        clearing type_val_to_struct in policydb_index_others.
      * Improved memory use by SELinux by both reducing the avtab
        node size and reducing the number of avtab nodes (by not
        expanding attributes in TE rules when possible).  Added
        expand_avtab and expand_cond_av_list functions for use by
        assertion checker, hierarchy checker, compatibility code,
        and dispol.  Added new inline ebitmap operators and converted
        existing users of ebitmaps to the new operators for greater
        efficiency.

  * New upstream release. Changes:
    * MLS build fixes.
    * Added sepol_set_policydb_from_file and sepol_check_context for
      setfiles.
  * Even though the API has changed, the soname has not been bumped
    upstream on the grounds that no one is using this yet. Since we have
    not yet shipped libsepol, I guess I am OK with that.
