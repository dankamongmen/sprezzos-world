_Description: Do you want system-wide readable home directories?
 By default, users' home directories are readable by all users on the
 system. If you want to increase security and privacy, you might want
 home directories to be readable only for their owners. But if in doubt,
 leave this option enabled.
 .
 This will only affect home directories of users added from now
 on with the adduser command.
