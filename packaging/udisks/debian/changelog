udisks (1.0.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/13-dosfslabel.patch: The original reasons why mlabel was
    preferred over dosfslabel are no longer true. So switch back to dosfslabel
    which is part of dosfstools which we already require for mkfs.vfat and
    drop the Recommends on mtools. Fix the maximum length for FAT labels while
    at it. (Closes: #680683)

  * New upstream release.
    - Recognize Realtek PCI card reader. (LP: #759963)
    - Stop polling CD drives with udev >= 172 (soon to be released), which

  * Activate support for udisks-tcp-bridge. Note that this is purely
    convenience and does not enable extra privileges (can do the same with ssh
    and dbus-send). This unbreaks the "Connect to server.." functionality in
    gnome-disk-utility. (LP: #568926)

    removal of a crypto device, use the luks_holder property since it is still
    available to figure out which underlying cleartext LUKS device to
    teardown, instead of scanning through all available devices (because the
    cleartext device already has had its properties cleaned up). Many thanks

    - Do not have files executable on NTFS.
    - Some test suite updates.
  * Remove debian/patches/00git-*.
  * Drop transitional devicekit-disks-doc package. It's been in testing long
    enough, and we do not want to carry it into the squeeze release.
  * debian/control: Have udisks Conflicts:/Replaces: devicekit-disks, to
    properly clean up. (Closes: #585169)
  * 02-defer_smart_probing.patch, 10-ide-cd-support.patch: Refresh to apply
    cleanly.
  * Switch to "3.0 (quilt)" format. Drop quilt build dependency.
  * 08-dont-probe-dm-devices.patch: Update for udisks and to current code, but
    still keep it disabled. Proper handling of linear DMs and DMMP devices
    (which are disabled right now, though) still require finding out the
    parent devices through UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_{PARAMS,TYPE} and there is
    currently no equivalent from the dmsetup rules.

udisks (1.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

    upstream git head. (LP: #14335)

    do not have a daemon polling CD drives for eject button presses. In order

  * Add 00git-crash-on-removing-NULL-value-from-hash.patch: Properly handle
    the situtation where we're processing a 'change' event but the 'remove'
    event has happened but is still queued up in our own process. Also handle
    device file renames and 'move' uevents.
    (http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24264, LP: #414407)
  * Add 06-show-MMC-MemStick-cards-by-default.patch: Show MMC/MemStick cards
    by default; the previous whitelist in the udev rules ignored them.
    (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24053, LP: #429752)
  * Add 05-german-translations.patch: Add German translations.

devicekit-disks (007-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Drop usage of DeviceKit, talk directly to udev now.
    - Port to PolicyKit 1 API.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * debian/control:
    - libpolkit-dbus-dev → libpolkit-gobject-1-dev, libpolkit-backend-1-dev
      build dependency. (PolicyKit 1 API)
    - libdevkit-gobject-dev → libgudev-1.0-dev build dependency, drop
      devicekit dependency (death to DeviceKit).
    - Bump libatasmart-dev build dependency to >= 0.14 as required by
      upstream.
    - Bump libudev-dev build dependency to >= 0.142 as required by upstream.
    - Drop libsqlite3-dev build-dependency, not necessary any more.
    - Add libsgutils2-dev build dependency as required by upstream.
  * debian/devicekit-disks.install: 
    - Update path for new policykit-1 files.
    - Add new pkgconfig file.
    - Install usr/share/locale and usr/share/man.
  * debian/rules: Ignore usr/lib/polkit-1/ for dh_makeshlibs, they are backends
    for PolicyKit.
  * debian/rules: Explicitly enable gtk-doc, not done by default any more.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes necessary).
  * Add debian/devicekit-disks.postinst: Kill the old devkit-disks-daemon on
    upgrade, to ensure that the new version will be used at the next occasion.
    (LP: #403192)
  * debian/control: Add Breaks to GDU libraries << 2.28, since the D-Bus API
    changed.
  * debian/*.install: Drop debian/tmp/ prefix, since we use dh compat 7.
    Also, simplify and sort the file lists.
  * Drop reduntant debian/devicekit-disks.manpages, already done in *.install.
  * debian/control: Add myself to Uploaders: with Michael's consent.
