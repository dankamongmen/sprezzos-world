google-gadgets (0.11.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Remove the postinst and postrm scripts of google-gadgets-common, as
    dh_installmime will take care of adding the proper snippets to trigger
    update-mime-database. (Closes: #591863)
  * Update debian/copyright:
    - explicitly list the sources in unittest/ which are licensed as BSD.
    - put the whole BSD license text instead of referring to
      /usr/share/common-licenses/BSD, which is deprecated in Debian Policy
      3.9.0.0.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1.
  * Change the Vcs-* headers to the new Git repository location.
  * Switch to format "3.0 (quilt)":
    - drop quilt build-dependency.
    - no need to use the quilt dh addon.
    - remove the debian/README.source file.
  * Rename libggadget-1.0-0.docs to libggadget-1.0-0b.docs, missed in the
    previous ABI adaptation.
  * Add myself as uploader.
  * Add "DM-Upload-Allowed: yes" in debian/control.

  * Release to unstable.

google-gadgets (0.11.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * New upstream release:
    - fixes a typo in the "World Daylight Clock". (Closes: #566168)
    - fixes GTK+ expose events with GTK+ >= 2.18. (Closes: #566169)
    - links ggl-qt to X11 and Xrender (Closes: #554696)
  * This new version of google-gadgets breaks API and ABI once again, so:
    - rename library packages, 'b' suffix this time.
    - add conflict against 'a' libraries.
    - update -dev packages dependency accordingly.
  * Make use of the xulrunner dh addon, so dh_xulrunner is run again.
  * Switch from cURL to SOUP for the xml_http_request module. Other than being
    recommended upstream, this also avoid crashes which can happen with
    gnutls. (Closes: #566167)
  * Install the html-flash-element extension in the -common package.
  * Make libggadget-gtk-1.0-dev and libggadget-qt-1.0-dev depend respectively
    on libgtk2.0-dev and libqt4-dev, as they use their host libraries in the
    public headers.
  * Add patch 05_hurd_pthread.patch to force linking with pthread (workaround
    Hurd issue).
  * Add author and small descriptions to all the patches.
  * Refresh patch 03_GRE_Version.patch, thanks Mike Hommey for the hints.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4, no changes required.
  * Slightly improve descriptions: add main blurb in each package, fix a couple
    of typos.
  * Add lintian overrides:
    - the names of the lib* packages don't reflect the SO-names of the
      library/ies contained.
  * Make dh_install ignore .la files.
  * Adjust capitalisation of "QT" to "Qt" also in the ggl-qt.7 manpage.
  * Add also the SOVERSION to the .install files.

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * Since ABI breakages are going to continue, add *-api virtual packages
    to keep library count in the conflicts at the manageable level.
