TODO for openjpeg:
------------------

  * Build and distribute some of the additional tools including:
    + jpwl/         - JPEG 2000 Wireless tools: encode JPEG2000 files to
                      withstand transmission errors.
    + jp3d/         - Volumetric Imaging.
    + JavaOpenJPEG/ - Java Encoder/Decoder interface for libopenjpeg.
    Note, none of these tools are built by default in the standard OpenJPEG2000
    distribution. They are also not built from the top level makefile. Some of
    the tools do not build cleanly from the source distribution and require
    further work to be able to be included in the openjpeg-tools package. It
    is also noted that the tools are specifically excluded for non-windows builds
    in the CMake version of the build rules.

    The jpwl tools require a rebuild of the main libopenjpeg2 library with the
    -DUSE_JPWL option set. This causes incompatible changes with normal
    operation of libopenjpeg2 and would have to generate an alternative
    libopenjpeg2 library.

  * Improve the handling of the .so symlinks, which are at the moment manually
    created through debian/*.links, with hardcoded filenames.
