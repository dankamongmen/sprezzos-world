This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU bc and dc
utilities. GNU bc is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary
precision. GNU dc is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports
unlimited precision arithmetic. bc was written by Phil Nelson, Ken Pizzini
wrote dc.

bc was previously maintained by Bill Mitchell, Austin Donnelly, James
Troup, and Dirk Eddelbuettel.  The current package was put together by John
G. Hasler <jhasler@debian.org> from the GNU sources from
http://ftp.us.xemacs.org/pub/mirrors/gnu/alpha/gnu/bc/
Changes are documented in the changelog.Debian file, and below.

James Troup, the previous maintainer made the following changes :- 

o adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.  
o bc/scan.l (rc_len): define as int not char, to allow input > 128
  characters in length without crashing.
o configure.in: changed test for readline to use READLINELIB and not
  LIBS so we can link just bc with readline (as dc doesn't use it).
o bc/Makefile.am (LDADD): add @READLINELIB@
