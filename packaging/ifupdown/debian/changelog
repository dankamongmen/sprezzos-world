    - Make ifquery process mappings (LP: #850166).
    - Ensure ifquery always has no_act turned on.
  * Change --all behaviour:
    - If ifup or ifquery is called with the --all option, if doesn't just
      bring up all interfaces marked as "auto", but all interfaces of a
      specified class, "auto" by default. For most uses, this doesn't
      change anything, but lets all the interfaces of a specific class be
      brought up or queried.
  * Support cross-compilation, move Debian-specific things out of
    the Makefile (Closes: #666084).

      Ignore errors if they fail to configure for some reason (for example,
      if the interface happens to be renamed by udev before it's fully
      configured).
    - Override Lintian's false positives.
  * Remove /etc/default/ifupdown.
  * Call hook scripts when processing all interfaces:
    - If ifupdown is called with the --all option, before or after doing
      anything to the interfaces, it calls all the hook scripts (pre-up or
      down) with IFACE set to "--all", LOGICAL set to the current class
      specified by the --allow option (or "auto" if it's not set),
      ADDRFAM="meta" and METHOD="none".
  * Fix IPv6 issue on kFreeBSD.
  * Update test suite.
  * Improve manual pages.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.
  * Also closes: #535226:
    - In 0.7~alpha5, "auto" method has been added.

ifupdown (0.6.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add myself as co-maintainer with approval from Anthony Towns.
  * Change path of dhclient.leases to make sure the dhcp state survive
    reboots. (Closes: #311777)
  * Change leasehours option value to match the option name. 
  * Async ifup/ifdown modication based on patch from Scott James
    Remnant and Ubuntu.  (Closes: #347580)
    - Rewrite the way that ifup and ifdown read and write the state
      file.  Instead of storing it in memory and holding a lock on it
      (preventing concurrent processes from actually being concurrent)
      use atomic read and write functions that only hold the lock for
      very short periods.
    - Write to the state file when we start bringing up or tearing
      down the interface, so we don't ever try to do the same
      operation at the same time.
    - Update the state file once the operation is complete to ensure
      we record the actual status of it.

ifupdown (0.6.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "what does wine come in" release

  * Fix brown paper bag bug where %iface% maps to the logical interface

ifupdown (0.6.4-4.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload: bug fixes and some improvements, unfortunately
    they will not make it to sarge...
   [Javier Fernandez-Sanguino]
    - Added a generic --exclude option (modified ifupdown.nw and ifup.8)
      This way other scripts (such as /e/i/networking in netbase)
      can avoid bringing down 'lo' on shutdown doing: 'ifdown -e lo -a'
      This will help close #254705, #256680 and #208700.
    - Make it conflict with the dch-client version from experimental 
      (Closes: #242537, #242527)
    - Added usage examples provided by Thomas Hood (Closes: #247772)
    - L10n:
    	+ Updated catalan debconf templates provided by Aleix Badia i Bosch 
        (Closes: #248717)
        + Included Lithuanian translation of debconf templates provided

       + Build-Depend on version of debhelper with dh_installinit --name
       + Put dhcp3-client before dhcp-client in disjunctive dependency
         (Closes: #250713)
     - Add /etc/default/ifupdown (currently not used, will be in the
       future)
     - /etc/init.d/ifupdown:
        + Creates target of /etc/network/run if the latter is a dangling
	  symlink.  Thanks to AJT for good discussion.  (Closes: #242607)
        + Delete ifstate on stop  (Closes: #245067)
    - /etc/init.d/ifupdown-clean

ifupdown (0.6.4-4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix configuration of interfaces with multiple address families.
    (Closes: Bug#242867) 
  * Add testcase 3 to check for such errors.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Sat, 10 Apr 2004 16:47:57 +1000

ifupdown (0.6.4-4.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload. This is mostly a bug-fix release, no new
    features have been added and the behaviour of ifupdown has only changed
    slightly. Content has been reviewed by both the maintainer and several
    other maintainers (who have NMUed this package previously)
    - Ifupdown.dvi now depends on *eps files (Closes: #101204)
    - Added missing Build-Dep to noweb since the Makefile calls makenwdep.sh
      (and it calls 'noroots') on build.
    - Remove the undocumented (and unused) -s option from the manpage and the
      main.c code. (Closes: #231404)
    - inet6.defn
      + Make it possible to run an v4tunnel without an address (Closes: #96265)
    - inet.defn
      + Included different handling of dhclient3 versus dhclient.
      + Avoids inconsistency in interface state if the command run
       by ifup fails, also added -e option to dhclient in order to 
       have it return an error if it cannot get an address. 
       Notice that this is not yet done with dhclient3 (-1) since that would
       mean not running dhclient3 as a daemon and renews not being done.
       (Closes: #97782, #82339, #113338, #148666, #169194)
      + An independent lease file is created per interface so that dhclient
       can be used in more than one interface (Closes: #196366)
      + If dhcp3-client is installed (the binary /sbin/dhclient3 is available)
       then use the -r option instead of with a KILL signal, this enables
       it to release the DHCP release an execute the hook script before
       exiting. Also, the package now suggests 'dhcp-client | dhcp3-client'
       (since dhcp3-client does not provide dhcp-client as pump does)
       (Closes: #196865)
      + Added a metric option for routes, notice, however, the dhclient's
       -e (undocumented) option is not included from the provided patch.
       (Closes: #235993)
      + Use -r instead of -k when DHCP interfaces using pump are downed in 
       order to avoid killing all interfaces (only release the one asked for)
       (Closes: #198841)
      + Properly implement the 'hw' option in interfaces by defining the 
       hardware address before upping the interface. 
       (Closes: #224468, #84602)
      + Allow setting of the hw address in the dhcp method as suggested.
       (Closes: #135502)
    - examples:
      + Added an example in the interfaces file on how to setup an interface
       with multiple IP addresses. I've added a warning, though, since this
       is expected not to work in some cases and might generate inconsistencies
       between the real state and the one noted down in the interfaces state
       file. It is worth documenting this option (with known caveats) rather
       than have users figure it out for themselves.
       (Closes: #172147)
      + Added sample scripts ('ensureifup' and 'ifstate') to ensure that
       interfaces are always up (might be useful for crappy ISP providers)
       as provided by Yann Dirson (Closes: #86902)
      + Provide a 'generate-interfaces.pl' script under the examples dir
       in order to facilitate migration of network configuration in 
       pre-woody systems. This script might also be useful to migrate other
       Linux systems to Debian.
       (Closes: #57830)
      + Added a sample 'ifstate-complex' command. Since it is not documented
        I'm adding it to the examples and not closing #153222 with it (yet)
      + Fixed a syntax error in the 'check-mac-address.sh' script and added
        both a little bit of comment code and proper usage.
      + Provided an example on how to setup an interface without IP address
        using the 'manual' method. This is suitable for some cases where we 
        only want to have the interface to be up. This example can be used
        to setup PPPOE interfaces or network IDS listening on a network. 
        This might not be as good as providing a specific method but the
        maintainer considers that this is the way it should be handled.
        (Closes: #76142, #92993, #129003, #164823, #171981)
      + Also, provided an example bridge configuration script that can
        be setup in /e/n/if-{pre-up,down}.d/ in order to setup bridges.
    - Interfaces(5).pre:
      + Slight improvement in to better describe mapping and point to 
       the examples available. (Closes: #232594)
      + Minor changes in the manpage to avoid people being misled .
        (Closes: #232347)
      + Better description of mappings (Closes: #216716)
      + Document IFACE=LIFACE syntax (Closes: #213068)
      + Documented known bugs or limitations.
      + Reference the location of the network examples.
      + Reference also the "Debian Reference" manual since it is more
        verbose in how /e/n/interfaces and ifupdown works.
    - Ifup(8):
      + Document that the -a option will take down all interfaces.
       (Closes: #208607)
      + Also describe in which order are interfaces started/stopped when
        using -a which might avoid confusion, see  #208700 for example.
      + Changed manpage name to ifup (instead of ifupdown).
       (Closes: #81150)
      + Document known bugs in the manpage: state maintained is sometimes
       lost, the ifstate needs to be writable and there is a known deadlock
       issue.
      + Document known "limitations" and refer readers to alternatives to
        monitor interface changes such as ifupd and hotplug.
      + Minor formatting changes and rewrites for better comprehension.
    - Translations:
      + Added Spanish debconf translation provided by Carlos Valdivia.
       (Closes: #207727)
      + Added Japanese debconf translation provided by Kenshi Muto.
       (Closes: #210436)
      + Added Dutch debconf translation provided by Tim Dijkstra.
       (Closes: #213723)
      + Added Greek debconf translation provided by Konstantinos Margaritis.

      + Added simplified Chinese debconf translation provided by Hiei Xu.
       (Closes: #231910)
      + Added Czech debconf translation provided by Miroslav Kure.
       (Closes: #231995)
      + Added Turkish debconf translation provided by Recai Oktas.

      + Added Danish debconf translation provided by Morten Brix Pedersen.

    (thanks to all translators)

    (patch from weasel@debian.org)

    (Closes: Bug#114429)

ifupdown (0.6.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't delete /etc/network/ifstate every boot, just empty the file. This
    way people can symlink it to /var/run/ifstate if they so desire (ie, if
    /var is local and /etc is read-only). (Closes: Bug#103868, Bug#85206)
  * Explicitly set PATH in the environment, because pdksh is broken, broken
    I say. (Closes: Bug#83557, Bug#99444)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Tue, 19 Jun 2001 00:04:30 +1000

ifupdown (0.6.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add some test cases to hopefully catch miscompiles on silly
    architectures like alpha. Weirdly, I can't duplicate this bug on
    lully anymore, so I didn't add a -O0 workaround at this time. We'll
    see what happens. (Closes: Bug#81143)

  * Correct old /e/n/i check from -2 so it might even work. (Closes:
    Bug#81611)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Tue,  9 Jan 2001 10:48:18 +1000

ifupdown (0.6.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for old /etc/network/interfaces conffile (all comments, same
    md5, same size), and replace it with new conffile so as not to mislead
    people into forgetting the "auto" lines. (Closes: Bug#79822) 

  * Added wvdial support, theoretically. If it doesn't work, someone'll have
    to file a new bug and tell me. (Closes: Bug#76985)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Dec 2000 21:28:47 +1000

ifupdown (0.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Removes a bashism from the makefile, and uses
    ferror() correctly (hopefully) (Closes: Bug#75279, Bug#76086)

  * Add example that checks a MAC address is what it should be. (Closes:
    Bug#76198)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Nov 2000 15:33:22 +1000

ifupdown (0.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Debian patches incorporated upstream, and a
    big fix wrt memory allocation.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Oct 2000 18:38:10 -0700

ifupdown (0.6.2pr-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename to ifupdown. Let's see what breaks.

  * Add pointopoint option for static inet interfaces. (Closes: Bug#74563)

  * Updating to 0.6.x fixes some problems:
        --scheme no longer exists (Closes: Bug#54814)
        line numbers are reported (Closes: Bug#62542)
        you can use $IFACE in /e/n/interfaces (Closes: Bug#71779)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Oct 2000 19:30:54 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleanup /etc/network/ifstate when booting (it will be wrong
    if the system crashed).

  * This should be enough for ifupdown.deb to be updated, hopefully.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Oct 2000 19:41:34 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The previous few uploads should've fixed most of the bugs
    described in 72872. (Closes: Bug#72872)

  * Add .sh suffixes to the example mapping scripts.
  * Fix a typo in postinst (interface *file* not files)
  * Add a "press enter to continue" if the /e/n/i update fails. 

  * Moved /var/run/ifupdown.state to /etc/network/ifstate. Gross.
    (Closes: Bug#74312)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Oct 2000 23:52:02 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Automatically update /etc/network/interfaces, hopefully. 

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Oct 2000 21:53:21 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Started work on automatically converting from 0.5.x config format to
    0.6.x.
  * Move the example from /usr/share/doc/ifupdown to ifupdown0.6.
  * Add some example mapping scripts. 

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Oct 2000 18:15:10 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note that dhcpcd works with any kernel, not just 2.0 and 2.2.
  * Remove the "noauto" keyword from the manpage. Ooopsy.
  * Create /etc/network/if-*.d directories in preinst.
  * Update the example-etc-network-interfaces to use the auto keyword.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Sep 2000 17:05:21 -0700

ifupdown0.6 (0.6.2pr-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Forward port some fixes from the last .deb that I hadn't put in the
    upstream source. Whoops.

  * This is a beta package that doesn't upgrade cleanly from ifupdown. It's
    for testing purposes only.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Sep 2000 16:05:25 -0700

ifupdown (0.5.5pr-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Adjusted to *always* build from scratch if noweb is
    installed, to ensure that the various .c and .defn files are updated
    wherever possible. This should fix the problem where the updated
    inet6.defn wasn't being included, even after -2, amongst others.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Aug 2000 12:40:28 +1000

ifupdown (0.5.5pr-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: chmod +x any scripts that are created when the diff is
    applied. (Closes: Bug#70030)

  * ifupdown.nw: Forward port lost changes from netbase 3.18-4.
    (Closes: Bug#69723)
  * ifupdown.nw: Specify interface explicitly when adding default routes,
    and explicitly remove the route when deconfiguring an interface.
    (Closes: Bug#63071, Bug#67796)

  * debian/control: Add dependency on net-tools.

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Aug 2000 17:47:01 +1000

ifupdown (0.5.5pr-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thought through and removed build-dependency on noweb. This involves
    changing what I put in the .orig.tar.gz. (Closes: Bug#68869)

 -- Anthony Towns <ajt@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Aug 2000 18:09:09 +1000

ifupdown (0.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split from netbase.
