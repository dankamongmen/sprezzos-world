Description: Haskore Computer Music System
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This library provides a collection of Haskell modules designed for
 expressing musical structures in the high-level, declarative style of
 functional programming. In Haskore, musical objects consist of primitive
 notions such as notes and rests, operations to transform musical objects
 such as transpose and tempo-scaling, and operations to combine musical
 objects to form more complex ones, such as concurrent and sequential
 composition. From these simple roots, much richer musical ideas can
 easily be developed.
 .
 It outputs music representations in MIDI, CSound, SuperCollider or
 directly as an audio signal.
