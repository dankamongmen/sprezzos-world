libxslt (1.1.26-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Fix building for real: (Closes: #666333)
    - make(1) targets accumulate, they do not replace
    - You absolutely must not have a build-% (wildcard) target!
    - Never have a directory (or file) with the same name as a
      (phony) target, as it *will* prevent the target from being
      run while that file/directory exists, with varying messages
    => rename ./build/ to builddir and build-% to dobuild-%
    Discovered while trying to hand-fix an m68k build.
  * Throw in some lintian fixes (manpage, spelling) for good measure.

  * debian/compat: Switch to debhelper compat level 7.
  * debian/control: Build depend on debhelper >= 7.0.50~.
  * debian/rules:
    + Remove old source and diff rules. They only displayed a message

    + Remove workarounds for modified and deleted files. The modified file
      is not modified anymore, and as we're not using svn-buildpackage we
      also don't care about deleted files anymore.
    + Trust dpkg-buildpackage to set the CFLAGS.
    + Change the way python libs are built. We now use configure to set
      different environment with and without python, and arrange things so
      that we don't have to build the base libxslt library several times.
    + Use a common cache for main and python configure passes.
    + Modify libexslt.la in place in debian/tmp.
    + Switch to dh.
    + Deduplicate in /usr/lib/pyshared, not
      /usr/lib/python-support/python-libxslt1.

  * debian/libxslt1.install: Really removed.

    + Force build against latest libxml2 with "hacked" .la file so that
      libxslt's .la file doesn't contain spurious dependencies.

  * debian/libxslt-dev.install: Don't install libexslt.la.
  * debian/rules: Filter out dependency_libs in libexslt.la.
    The 2 latter changes fix build issues with libtool, though it breaks
    static linking with libtool, which was already broken by libxml2 anyway.
    We recommend the use of pkg-config --static --libs instead.
    Closes: #379714.
  * xst-config.in: Fix --static output to use xml2-config.

      itself replaces python2.x-libxslt1 packages, depending on
      python-libxml2.
  * debian/rules:
    + Changed rules to get the python versions we want to build for and
      adapted some rules to fit with the new setting.
    + Changed shell loops to make loops.
    + In case python binary modules are identical (and they are, but they
      may not be with future versions of the python headers), replace some
      of them with symbolic links.
    + Adapted rules to the fact we're installing in only one python package
      instead of several.
  * debian/pycompat: Set to 2, for new Python policy. Closes: #373457.

  * debian/control:
    + Removed Build-Dep on zlib1g-dev and python2.x-libxml2.

      linked against indirect dependencies.
  * NEWS: Updated. Closes: #372755.
  * libexslt.pc.in, libxslt.pc.in: Split Libs in Libs and Libs.private.

    Remove /usr/share/doc/libxslt1-dev/EXSLT/*.html, since there are no such

libxslt (1.1.8-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/EXSLT/API*, doc/EXSLT/html: Added missing documentation in upstream
    tarball.
  * Changed the way we install docs.
    + debian/*.docs: removed.
    + debian/rules: added common documents to dh_installdocs ; manually
      install documentation in /usr/share/doc/libxslt1-dev.
    + debian/libxslt1-dev.install: install documentation through that file.

libxslt (1.1.8-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/control: Build-depends upon libgcrypt11-dev for crypto extensions
    to libexslt. That avoids libxslt not building the crypto extensions when
    it is not present.
    Added dependency on libgcrypt11-dev to libxslt1-dev to avoid bugs like
    #265952 in third party packages.
    Programs linking to libexslt don't need to be rebuilt since the ABI with
    or without is the same. It's just that crypto extensions won't work.
  * Urgency set to high because that is quite annoying to not provide the same
    functionalities on different arches in a release.
