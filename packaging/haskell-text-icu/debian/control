Description: bindings to the ICU library
 Haskell bindings to the International Components for Unicode (ICU)
 libraries. These libraries provide robust and full-featured Unicode
 services on a wide variety of platforms.
 .
 Features include:
 .
 Both pure and impure bindings, to allow for fine control over efficiency
 and ease of use.
 .
 Breaking of strings on character, word, sentence, and line boundaries.
 .
 Access to the Unicode Character Database (UCD) of character metadata.
 .
 String collation functions, for locales where the conventions for
 lexicographic ordering differ from the simple numeric ordering of
 character codes.
 .
 Character set conversion functions, allowing conversion between
 Unicode and over 220 character encodings.
 .
 Unicode normalization. (When implementations keep strings in a
 normalized form, they can be assured that equivalent strings have a
 unique binary representation.)
 .
 Regular expression search and replace.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
