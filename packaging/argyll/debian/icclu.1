.SH DESCRIPTION
Translate colors through an ICC profile, V2.12
Author: Graeme W. Gill
usage: icclu [\-v level] [\-f func] [\-i intent] [\-o order] profile
.TP
\fB\-v\fR level
Verbosity level 0 \- 2 (default = 1)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR function
f = forward, b = backwards, g = gamut, p = preview
.TP
\fB\-i\fR intent
p = perceptual, r = relative colorimetric,
s = saturation, a = absolute
.TP
\fB\-p\fR oride
x = XYZ_PCS, l = Lab_PCS, y = Yxy,
.TP
\fB\-o\fR order
n = normal (priority: lut > matrix > monochrome)
r = reverse (priority: monochrome > matrix > lut)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR scale
Scale device range 0.0 \- scale rather than 0.0 \- 1.0
.IP
The colors to be translated should be fed into standard input,
one input color per line, white space separated.
A line starting with a # will be ignored.
A line not starting with a number will terminate the program.
