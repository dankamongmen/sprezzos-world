    must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
    (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
    documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
    the Independent JPEG Group".
    (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
    full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
    NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

    These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
    not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
    acknowledge us.

    Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
    in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
    it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
    software".

    We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
    commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
    assumed by the product vendor.


    ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
    sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
    ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
    by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
    that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
    ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
    of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
    the foregoing paragraphs do.

    The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
    It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
    The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
    ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
    by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

    It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
    patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
    legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
    support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
    (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
    Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
    So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
    code.

    The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
    To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
    been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
    "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
    resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
    GIF decoders.

    We are required to state that
        "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
        CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
        CompuServe Incorporated."
