Description: GObject JavaScript bindings for the webkit engine - Interpreter
 Seed is a library and interpreter, dynamically bridging (through
 GObjectIntrospection) the WebKit JavaScriptCore engine, with the GNOME
 platform. Seed serves as something which enables you to write
 standalone applications in JavaScript, or easily enable your
 application to be extensible in JavaScript.
 .
 This package contains the interpreter itself, for use by the scripts
 using seed as a shebang.
