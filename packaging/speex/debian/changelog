speex (1.2~rc1-SprezzOS1) unstable; urgency=low

  * SprezzOS build of final release

 -- Nick Black <nick.black@sprezzatech.com>  Sat, 08 Dec 2012 00:45:42 -0500

speex (1.2~rc1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minimal set of resampler RC fixes targeted for Wheezy.
  * Fixes a bug with selecting the resampler with the smallest memory footprint
    for some sample rate pairs.
  * Fixes a bug where the filter length may not have been a multiple of 8 for
    some sample rate pairs, as is needed for the SSE implementation to avoid
    the SSE operations reading past the end of the buffer.
  * Fixes a type mismatch in computing allocation sizes.  This should not be a
    problem on any currently existing Debian arch, but it was obviously wrong,
    and the fix is trivial and obviously right, so there's no point waiting for
    someone to hit it before we correct this.
  * Fixes the problem seen with some sample rate pairs if an integer number of
    samples are not processed every frame, leading to clicking or truncation.
    Closes: #689049

speex (1.2~rc1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build for multi-arch.  Closes: #637600

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 03 Jun 2012 06:17:12 +0930

speex (1.2~rc1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build the fixed-point version for mips(el) too.
    Float performance there seems suspect, at least under some conditions.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 23 May 2012 13:47:08 +0930

speex (1.2~rc1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build with 'hardening' flags enabled.  Closes: #655880
  * Check the size of the header packet before we look inside it in
    speex_packet_to_header().  Which wasn't detected by the magic flags,
    but was spotted in an old-fashioned by-eye code review while sanity
    checking the new OggOpus spec.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 22 May 2012 07:17:03 +0930

speex (1.2~rc1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Work around extra dh_install retardedness that using a higher compat
    level brought us.  We probably should just return to using cp instead.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Dec 2011 00:35:26 +1030

speex (1.2~rc1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a -dbg package.  Closes: #646035
  * Disable the arm4-asm optimisation for armhf, it wants to insist we use
    thumb2 code for that.  Closes: #651578, #651846

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Dec 2011 23:09:39 +1030

speex (1.2~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This one should be our release candidate for Lenny.
  * Fixes a memory leak in the echo canceller.
  * Less aggressive noise adaptation.
  * Adds the channel decorrelation interface, which completes the planned
    changes prior to freezing the 1.2 API.  This doesn't affect any existing
    code, so the possibilities for regression are slim.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jul 2008 03:39:44 +0930

speex (1.2~beta4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move the extra sse libs to /usr/lib/sse2.  That is a bit more elitist than
    we need to be, but the linker already looks there without adding yet another
    path permutation, and in practice most people who really care about how long
    this is going to take won't find that sets the bar too high for them at all.

    Actually, it's apparently ldconfig rather than the linker that is missing
    this path, but this will still do for now while people figure out if or when
    that should be fixed too.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 04 Jun 2008 03:48:19 +0930

speex (1.2~beta4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream snapshot release.
  * Fixes a speexdec regression causing all files to be decoded by as stereo
  * Better support for arch specific optimisations.  We build for both sse and
    487 on x86, and for fixed point with v4 asm for ARM.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 04 Jun 2008 00:40:14 +0930

speex (1.2~beta3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot.  Reverts an accidental API change in beta3.1
  * Conflicts with the packages known to be affected by the speexdsp split.
    Closes: #474253
  * Drop Uploaders that are no longer active, by request from #pkg-voip.
  * Enable sse support for amd64.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Apr 2008 23:22:26 +0930

speex (1.2~beta3.1.ds-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include .pc fixes accepted upstream and the upstream doxygen config
    from their git repo source.
  * Try to convince cdbs not to build the docs for arch specific builds...
  * That apparently cannot be done, so it's off to the bit bucket for this
    vile opiate of the clueless.  My patience with its stupidity is ended.
    Closes: #474017

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 03 Apr 2008 09:21:42 +0930

speex (1.2~beta3.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot.  Includes the API support required for mumble.
    Closes: #467361
  * Add a Homepage field and make the Vcs- fields less XS-ive.
    Thanks to Patrick Matthäi for spotting this.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Mar 2008 08:19:59 +1030

speex (1.2~beta3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Splits the unstable API functions into their own
    library.  Apps which used them previously now need to link to libspeexdsp
    as well.
  * Fixes "Inconsistency in preprocessor API".  Closes: #439516
  * Add myself to uploaders, with the blessing of #debian-voip

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Mar 2008 05:49:20 +1030

speex (1.2~beta2-3.1) experimental; urgency=low

speex (1.2~beta2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix build-depends: doxygen needs to be listed in Build-Depends as well as
    in Build-Depends-Indep according to policy. We don't just run the
    build-arch and binary-arch for binary-builds, still.
    - speex_1.2~beta2-1(experimental/powerpc/anakreon): Call of doxygen in
    wrong target (Closes: #429188)
  * Use ${binary:Version} for binNMU-safe uploads
    Add dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.19) to Build-Depends
  * Update Build-Depends on debhelper to allow use of debhelper.mk in CDBS.
  * Ditch direct Depends of speex on libspeex1 as it'll come through CDBS
    magic anyway.

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Aug 2007 22:16:45 +0200
