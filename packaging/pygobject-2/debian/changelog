pygobject-2 (2.28.6-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in: Drop the "Provides: python2.6-gobject". There are no
    reverse dependencies anyway, and we don't encourage any new ones.
  * Add 00git_class_init.patch: Move property and signal creation into
    _class_init(). This allows old PyGTK applications to work with static
    PyGObject and GLib 2.35.x. (LP: #1129309)

pygobject-2 (2.28.6-9) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high as this blocks the testing migration of g-i, pygobject, and
    others, and this is a trivial change.
  * debian/control.in: Add "Provides: python2.x-gobject" to python-gobject-2
    to also satisfy dependencies for packages which use the obsolete explicit

pygobject-2 (2.28.6-7) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Rename python-gobject-dev to

pygobject-2 (2.28.6-5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Split package: The 2.28 version is now deprecated and called pygobject-2;
    it will only contain the old static bindings without introspection.  The
    pygobject 3.0 version only contains the introspection bindings now, and
    will depend on python-gobject-2 for backwards compatibility until all
    packages get ported to use introspection.
    - debian/control.in, debian/rules: Rename packages to *-2 and update
      description to point out that these are deprecated and only provided for
      backwards compatibility.
    - debian/control.in, debian/rules: Drop python 3 packages; python3-gobject
      does not yet have any reverse dependencies, and we don't want to
      encourage porting to Python 3 without porting to GI as well.
    - debian/control.in: Update Vcs-* for pygobject-2 branch.
    - debian/rules: Disable introspection support. Drop gobject-introspection
      and libgirepository1.0-dev build dependencies.
    - debian/control.in: Conflicts/Breaks python-gobject{,-dbg} << 2.90.

pygobject (2.28.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cherrypick some fixes from pygobject-2-28 upstream branch:
    - 00git_test_case_hang.patch: Fix hang in test suite when
      TestGDBusClient.test_native_calls_async() test case fails.
    - 00git_messagebox_type.patch: Fix MessageBox so it correctly handles
      the type constructor param.
    - 00git_python3_build.patch, 00git_python3-maketrans.patch: Python 3 fixes.
    - 00git_gio_test.patch: Port test_properties from static gio to GI Gio, so
      that the tests will also work with Python 3.
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Add and build python3-gobject and
    python3-gobject-dbg packages. Until we get py3cairo packaged in Debian (in
    the works), we need to build the python3 flavour with --disable-cairo, and
    apply some workarounds in debian/rules (see the "FIXME"s); these will
    disappear again with py3cairo.

  * New upstream release (Closes: #619338).

    - Drop XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
    - Make python-gobject-dbg Depends against ${python:Depends}
      instead of python-dbg
    - Build-dependends against dh-autoreconf

  * Drop debian/patches/99_autoreconf.patch: Not needed anymore
  * debian/rules: Call dh_autoreconf{_clean} instead of handeling this by hand,
    should Closes: #558530

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/rules: Move from pysupport (which is being deprecated) to
    dh_python2. Drop python-support build dependency.
    (Closes: #614764)
  * debian/rules: Install a library search path for a pysupport compatible
    gtk-2.0 directory, to avoid instantly breaking all reverse dependencies.
    This needs to stay until they get converted to dh_python2.
  * Fix test suite calls during package build (Closes: #619257):
    - debian/rules: Copy Python files from our modules into build tree, so
      that the tests actually find them. In Python you can't have Python
      modules and compiled extensions which belong to the same import in
      different directories. (Unfortunately it's hard to upstream this, so
      keep it as a Debian specific hack for now.)
    - debian/rules: Run the tests under xvfb so that the Gdk/Gtk ones can
      succeed.
    - debian/rules: Disable fakeroot for the tests by unsetting $LD_PRELOAD.
      Otherwise the tests try to connect to root's session D-BUS.
    - debian/control.in: Add build dependencies: xvfb (as we now use it in
      debian/rules), dbus-x11 (as the test suite uses dbus-launch), and
      python-apt-dbg/python-cairo-dbg, so that the test cases for the debug
      builds have all dependencies met.
