Description: package change history notification tool
 The tool apt-listchanges can compare a new version of a
 package with the one currently installed and show what has been
 changed, by extracting the relevant entries from the Debian changelog
 and NEWS files.
 .
 It can be run on several .deb archives at a time to get a list of all
 changes that would be caused by installing or upgrading a group of
 packages. When configured as an APT plugin it will do this
 automatically during upgrades.
