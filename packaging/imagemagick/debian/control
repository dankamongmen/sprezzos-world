Description: image manipulation programs
 ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images.
 It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100)
 including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript,
 SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
 shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special
 effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier curves. 
 All manipulations can be achieved through shell commands as well as through
 an X11 graphical interface (display).

Description: low-level image manipulation library
 The MagickCore API is a low-level interface between the C programming language
 and the ImageMagick image processing libraries and is recommended for
 wizard-level programmers only. Unlike the MagickWand C API which uses only a
 few opaque types and accessors, with MagickCore you almost exclusively access
 the structure members directly.
 .
 This package contains the C libraries needed to run executables that make
 use of MagickCore.

Description: image manipulation library 
 The MagickWand API is the recommended interface between the C programming
 language and the ImageMagick image processing libraries. Unlike the
 MagickCore C API, MagickWand uses only a few opaque types. Accessors are
 available to set or get important wand properties.
 .
 This package contains the C libraries needed to run executables that make
 use of MagickWand.

Suggests: imagemagick-doc
Description: Perl interface to the ImageMagick graphics routines
 PerlMagick is an objected-oriented Perl interface to ImageMagick.
 Use the module to read, manipulate, or write an image or image sequence from
 within a Perl script. This makes it very suitable for Web CGI scripts.
