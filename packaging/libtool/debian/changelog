    Remove patches applied upstream:
    - define_shlibpath_overrides_runpath4hurd.patch
    - tagdemo-libfoo.patch

  * New upstream release (Closes: #586246)
    - Change license of documentation to GFDL 1.3

    testsuite test.  (Closes: #560219)

 -- Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckx.be>  Wed, 09 Dec 2009 21:51:21 +0100

libtool (2.2.6b-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixes CVE-2009-3736 (Closes: #559797)
  * Skip demo-deplibs.test.  This is basicly the same as
    deplibs_test_disable.patch from the 1.5.26 version.
  * Skip the link-order2.at test.  It has the same problem
    as the deplibs test.
  * Since deplibs-ident.at now passes, just let it return that
    the result is ok.
  * Skip localization test when setlocale is not functional.
  * Renable test suite.
  * Remove the "Apps/" part of the doc-base entry.

    failure.  See #555801.
  * Symbol versioning works with the GNU gold linker now. (Closes: #554821)

 -- Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckx.be>  Wed, 09 Dec 2009 20:05:39 +0100

libtool (2.2.6a-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * link_all_deplibs was only set to no for the CXX tag.  Set it to no
    again for all tags.  (Closes: #522663)
  * Don't let a failed testsuite also fail to build for now.  The combination
    of setting link_all_deplibs=no and the deplib_binary.patch make some test
    fail, but those look like testsuite errors.

 -- Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckx.be>  Tue, 07 Apr 2009 19:55:06 +0200

libtool (2.2.6a-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add all info pages (Closes: #495411, #512013)
  * Force /bin/bash as shell of /usr/bin/libtool instead of /bin/sh.  The

libtool (1.5.22-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Properly set link_all_deplibs on k*bsd*-gnu.  The previous
    patch for kfreebsd didn't set it in all cases.  Patch from
    Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org> (Closes: #355789)
  * Make k*bsd*-gnu do the same as on Linux in all cases.  It
    should behave the same.  Based on patch by Aurelien Jarno.
  * Don't build depend on gcj on kfreebsd-amd64
  * Rename bsd.dpatch to netbsdelf.dpatch, since it now
    only adds support for netbsdelf*-gnu.

 -- Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckx.be>  Sat, 11 Mar 2006 16:11:11 +0100

libtool (1.5.22-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove a "--" line from the generate tag for BINCC.  It
    resulted in "--: command not found" error.  Thanks to 
    John V. Belmonte for reporting it and Ralf Wildenhues
    for the fix.  (Closes: #345607)

 -- Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckx.be>  Mon,  9 Jan 2006 16:06:58 +0100

libtool (1.5.22-1) unstable; urgency=low

libtool (1.5.20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a conflict on libtool1.4 for libltdl3-dev.  They have overlapping
    files and libtool1.4 should get removed anyway.  (Closes: #329697)
  * Put usr/share/libtool/libltdl in the libltdl3-dev, so libtoolize --ltdl
    works again
  * Don't build-depend gcj on kfreebsd-i386, they don't have it.
    (Closes: #329703)
  * Change Standards-Version to 3.6.2, no changes.

 -- Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckx.be>  Sun, 25 Sep 2005 16:16:17 +0200

libtool (1.5.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (Closes: #302484)
  * New upstream release (Closes: #265005)
    - Configure test to detect -fPIC support in combination with other CFLAGS
      could fail to detect if it's supported. (1.5.16)  (Closes: #219490)
    - ia64 tests should have been fix, run them again. (1.5.10)
    - Fix .libs/.libs/libfoo.so link problem when linking against an other lib
      from the same package. (1.5.8)
  * Enable gcj on hppa again since gcj-4.0 is available on it.
  * Enable the test suite on m68k again, slow is not a good reason not to run
    it.
  * Move ltdl.m4 from libtool to libltdl-dev package, where it belongs.
    Add a conflicts/replaces from libltdl-dev to the libtool package.
  * Remove usr/share/libtool/libltdl from the libtool package
  * Make the libtool.m4 in /usr/share/libtool a symlink to the one in 
    /usr/share/aclocal.
  * libltdl3-dev.preinst: No longer remove the old directory on upgrade.
    libltdl3-dev.preinst does nothing now so remove the file.
  * libtool.postinst: We don't run ltconfig anymore, so don't play with
    cc's alternatives.
  * Put the config.guess and config.sub symlinks in the package instead
    of creating them in the libtool.postinst.  Remove the libtool.postinst
    and libtool.prerm scripts since they do nothing now.
  * Add AUTHORS, README, THANKS and TODO in the docs dir.
  * Remove obsolete conflicts/replaces for libltdl0.1 and libltdl0,
    it's not even in woody.
  * Split out patches, and convert to using dpatch
  * Always do a full bootstrap of the configure scripts before
    building so I only have to patch 1 file.
  * Embed the debian version in libtool.m4 and ltmain.in/sh
  * Add a watch file.

  * Apply patch from Joel Baker to support Debian GNU/kNetBSD systems
    with *-*-netbsdelf-gnu triplet.  Closes: #244770.
  * Fail earlier on invalid version_type so we output a useful error
    message.  Closes: #247169.
  * Skip the Non-PIC test on x86-64, it can't handle Non-PIC code inside

libtool (1.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    This largely just included our patches from 1.5, there are a couple
    of additional bug fixes in this release though.
  * Move to a single libtool.info file.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sun, 25 Jan 2004 14:45:02 +0000

libtool (1.5-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch from Robert Millan <zeratul2@wanadoo.es> to complete
    support for GNU/kNetBSD.  Closes: #224440.
  * Apply keybuk-precious-files.patch (backported from 1.6) to add
    an option to prevent the removal of files from the temporary
    output directory.  Closes: #221420.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sun, 11 Jan 2004 01:33:18 +0000

libtool (1.5-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bring the various copyright files up to par.
  * Apply patch to infer tagged configuration in link mode with all
    compiler arguments available, rather than just the first.
  * Remove the mkdir -p option from when creating a temporary output
    directory to prevent symlink abuse.
  * Generate the info files on build as we need a certain --split-size
    for hysterical raisins.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sat,  3 Jan 2004 14:49:52 +0000

libtool (1.5-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add missing 'continue' line when acting on finding -pthread and friends
    in $deplibs.  This line of code is in all my copies of ltmain, it's in
    my test package of libtool, it's in the upstream CVS where I comitted it,
    it's in the patch file I made to do that and is in the 1.4.3 package that
    used the same patch; but for no apparent reason it vanished from the
    Debian 1.5-6 package!  Closes: #221467.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Tue, 18 Nov 2003 17:08:17 +0000

libtool (1.5-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Error in the binary targets if a .svn directory exists, to prevent
    me accidentally shipping them in the diff.  To create binary packages
    from the svn source add TEST=yes to the debian/rules line.
    Closes: #219461.
  * Fix libtoolize so the cd command run when AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR is used
    is shown when --dry-run is given.  Closes: #153699.
  * Yet Another(tm) patch to prevent hardcoding of dependency library
    rpaths, replacing the one in 1.5-3.  Any path listed in /etc/ld.so.conf
    is now not rpathed.  This is more palatable upstream.
  * The Ultimate -pthread Patch(tm), the previous change broke placing
    -pthread in libs' $deplibs.  This new patch treats the arguments the
    same for libraries and programs, and even honours them when found
    in dependency_libs but doesn't place them there first.
  * Infer near-default configuration when invoked as 'libtool cc' rather
    than complaining that we can't infer a tag.
  * Fix -static, -prefer-pic and -prefer-non-pic when used with a tagged
    configuration.  Closes: #217834.
  * Synchronise with upstream CVS.  The changes are:
    - MinGW reverted back to an objdump-base test.
    See changelog.gz for more detail.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sun, 16 Nov 2003 15:10:15 +0000

libtool (1.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch to preserve --tag, --debug, --quiet and
    --silent arguments when invoking ourselves to perform
    relink or finish modes.  Closes: #214484.
  * Don't propogate -pthread and friends to dependency_libs, but also
    don't complain when we find it there.  This fixes the recent GNOME
    problems without breaking anything else (I hope).

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Wed, 29 Oct 2003 17:31:07 +0000

libtool (1.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove Build-Depends-Indep placing texi2html and texinfo in
    Build-Depends.  Policy is wrong, the buildds do not ensure these are
    installed for the "build" target of debian/rules.  Closes: #216492.
  * Built with dpkg 1.10.10, the latest version ignores the
    [!hppa !mips !mipsel] clause in Build-Depends.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Sun, 19 Oct 2003 16:19:22 +0100

libtool (1.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Synchronise with upstream CVS, in case they decide to skip 1.5.1
    after all and go straight to 1.6.  The changes are:
    - GNU/KNetBSD support added.
    - lt_dlrealloc now part of the libltdl API.  Closes: #120169.
    See changelog.gz for more detail.
  * Run 'make check' after build to make sure it all works.
  * Fix permissions of tests/mdemo2-*.test so "make check" will work.
  * Move rules to create info files and examples .tar.gz files to
    the build target so we don't pollute them with stuff from "make check".
  * Disable demo-nopic test on hppa.
  * Add /usr/local/lib and /usr/X11R6/lib to sys_lib_dlsearch_path_spec.
  * Add gcc-3.3 to the list of packages we maintain the /usr/bin/cc
    alternative for.  Closes: #216349.
  * Remove dead code from libtool.m4.  Closes: #210378.
  * Add the various compiler threading options to dependency_libs, and
    don't barf if we find them.
  * Merge addition of --no-supress option from HEAD.  Closes: #207475.
  * Mention that libtool-doc will become non-free after sarge.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Wed,  1 Oct 2003 00:27:19 +0100

libtool (1.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make mdemo2-*.test executable so they don't fail when you go
    "make check"
  * Prevent recursion on missing ltmain.sh by checking ltmain.in
    exists first.  Closes: #164452.
  * Remove build dependency on gcj on hppa, mips and mipsel to
    fix build failure.  Closes: #207923.
  * Remove fallback suggestion of java-compiler, libtool will
    only support gcj for the forseeable future.
  * Place NEWS and ChangeLog files in all packages, also add missing
    ChangeLog.1 file.  Closes: #205458.
  * Always use pass_all on Linux ELF, host_cpu is irrelevant.
    Closes: #208552.
  * Don't pass -nostdlib to gcc when creating an archive so we can
    throw away all the gcc version-specific hardcoding.  Closes: #206356.
  * Ensure STRIP variable is properly quoted.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@netsplit.com>  Wed, 10 Sep 2003 23:42:48 +0100

libtool (1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release of the "multi language" version of GNU Libtool.
    This is a cooler and more froody version of Libtool than 1.4 was
    and not only makes C++ libraries properly but does Fortran77 and
    compiled Java libraries too.  The catch?  It won't work with
    packages still using Autoconf 2.13.  Either upgrade your
    configure.in to Autoconf 2.5x, or install the libtool1.4 package.
    Closes: #190216, #195278, #192918.
