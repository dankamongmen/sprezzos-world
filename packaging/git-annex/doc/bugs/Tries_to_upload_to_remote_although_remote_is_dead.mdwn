What steps will reproduce the problem?

I added a (encrypted) ssh remote and everything worked fine. Now I marked the remote as dead, but git-annex still tries to upload to this remote. I recognize this because it asks for my ssh and gpg keys passwords. 

While transfering (or asking for the password), `git annex status` shows the following:

As you can see, the `vserver2` remote is marked as dead but git-annex still tries to upload. This problem keeps occuring even after restarts. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

If I do not get the `dead` status wrong, git-annex should not use these remotes.


What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex HEAD from yesterdays git. Ubuntu 12.10
