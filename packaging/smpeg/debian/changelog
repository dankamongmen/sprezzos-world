smpeg (0.4.5+cvs20030824-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add libsmpeg-dev.preinst to remove /usr/share/doc/libsmpeg-dev symlink to
    libsmpeg0, if existing from previous versions of the package (it was like
    that in Squeeze).  Otherwise, when -dev is removed, it removes files from
    the libsmpeg0 package.  Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for the report (Closes:
    #700787).
