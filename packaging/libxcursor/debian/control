Description: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.

Description: X cursor management library (unstripped)
 This package provides an unstripped shared object with debugging symbols,
 useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a debugger; this
 facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding logic errors in
 programs using this library (or the library itself).  The library is
 installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that directory in the
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to be debugged is
 executed.  Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.
