Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: xorriso, cdck
Description: command line CD/DVD/BD writing tool
 cdrskin strives to be a second source for the services traditionally
 provided by cdrecord.
 Currently it does CD-R and CD-RW this way. Overwritable media DVD-RAM,
 DVD+RW, DVD-RW, and BD-RE are handled differently than with cdrecord-ProDVD
 in order to offer TAO-like single track recording. Sequential DVD-R[W],
 DVD+R, DVD+R DL are handled like CD-R[W] with TAO and multi-session.
 Additionally cdrskin offers cdrecord-ProDVD-like mode DAO with DVD-R[W].
 .
 This is a burner only application. If you want a burner and image 
 manipulation application, please install xorriso package.
