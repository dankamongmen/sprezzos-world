  * debian/rules:
    - Dropped 'override_dh_shlibdeps' target that called dh_shlibdeps with an
      obsolete '-l' flag.
    - Added 'override_dh_makeshlibs' target that calls dh_makeshlibs with
      -X/usr/lib/gnucash/ to get rid of a bunch of
      unused-shlib-entry-in-control-file Lintian warnings.

gnucash (1.8.10-10) unstable; urgency=medium
    
  * medium urgency because the bad Depends is causing grief for many users. 
  
  * control: Set Priority to optional.
  
  * control (gnucash Depends): Partially revert last change; don't depend
    on dfontmgr or lmodern; the former is a GUI and the latter is
    essentially all of TeX.  gnucash runs fine without both.

gnucash (1.8.10-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * high urgency upload because the fix for critical bug 291632 didn't get

    uploaded with urgency low, and the package is still badly stuck.
    People need the bug fix for 291632 and this will move it along.  No
    changes to the source.

  * debian/rules: Don't use --enable-hbci; omit hbci-specific bits.
  * debian/control: Drop gnucash-hbci.
    (This does not signify the abandonment of HBCI intentions for gnucash,
     but actually the opposite: once suitable aqbanking packages appear in
     Debian, then I'll enable HBCI as a standard option.)
  * debian/control: Require libofx1-dev, not libofx-dev (which is
    deprecated).  Don't require libopenhbci-dev, libchipcard20-dev,
    libopenhbci-plugin-ddvcard.
    
  * debian/rules (dh_shlibdeps): Program does not take multiple -l
    options; use a colon separated list.
