autoconf (2.69-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    
  * The Autoconf documentation is again licensed in a DFSG-compliant
    manner, so it is now again included for the first time since 2004.
    Many thanks to Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org> and Henrique de Moraes
    Holschuh <hmh@debian.org> for maintaining the documentation in
    non-free for that time.
  
    The following changes result from that merge:
  
      - debian/README.Debian: Add some advice from autoconf-nonfree.

      - debian/control: Add autoconf-doc, using wording from
        autoconf-nonfree.

      - debian/autoconf-doc.doc-base: New file, from autoconf-nonfree.

      - debian/autoconf-doc.docs: New file, based on autoconf-nonfree.

      - debian/autoconf-doc.info: New file, from autoconf-nonfree.

      - debian/autoconf-doc.links: New file, from autoconf-nonfree.

      - debian/rules: Install documentation.

  * Convert to 3.0 (quilt) source format.
  
  * debian/rules: Modernize based on the "dh" helper, using
    autoconf-nonfree as example.
  
  * debian/control: Update Standards-Version: to 3.9.3 (no changes
    required).
  
  * debian/control: Replace Conflicts: by Breaks: based on
    conflicts-with-version lintian warning and Policy 7.4 "Conflicting
    binary packages - Conflicts".

autoconf (2.68-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * Reverted the workaround added to lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4 in 2.67-2, in
    favor of a Conflicts: against pkg-config earlier than 0.25-1.1, the
    version that fixed the bug being worked around in pkg-config.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Sat, 09 Apr 2011 09:50:27 -0700

autoconf (2.67-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * lib/m4sugar/m4sh.m4: Add a trailing space to the definition of
    AS_ERROR, following AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD, to work around Bug #591547 in
    pkg-config that breaks PKG_CHECK_MODULES.

    This is presumably temporary, until a fixed pkg-config can be
    released, at which time this workaround can be reverted and a conflict
    added against unfixed pkg-config versions.

    Closes: #591548.

    to GPLv3 when Autoconf's copyright changed, but I forgot.  Thanks to
    Kalle Olavi Niemitalo <kon@iki.fi> for reporting the problem.  Closes:
    #571729.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Feb 2010 10:18:53 -0800

    text regression" by Ralf Wildenhues to fix bug reported by Pierre
    Ynard <linkfanel@yahoo.fr>.  Closes: #560105.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Dec 2009 19:56:06 -0800

    C++ compiler.  Thanks to Michal Čihař <nijel@debian.org> for reporting
    the bug and to Ralf Wildenhues and Eric Blake for reviewing it.
    Closes: #557632.

  * Really update policy version from 3.8.2 to 3.8.3 (no changes
    required).  This was changelogged for the previous version but I
    forgot to actually make the change.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Nov 2009 20:00:03 -0800

    Autoconf.

  * Updated policy version from 3.8.2 to 3.8.3 (no changes required).

    package that unnecessarily duplicated the values from the source
    package.

    compatibility level 7.  Thanks to Jan Hauke Rahm <jhr@debian.org> for
    reporting the problem.  Closes: #555885.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Nov 2009 09:10:44 -0800

autoconf (2.64-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove spurious file from Debian diff.  Thanks to Christian Egli
    <christian.egli@sbszh.ch> for reporting the problem.  Closes: #555706.

  * Update debhelper compatibility level from 4 to 7 (suggested by
    lintian).  No other changes needed.

  * Updated policy version from 3.7.2 to 3.8.2:
    - Added Homepage to control file.
    - No other changes necessary.

  * Removed debian/autoconf.postinst.  Everything it did applied only to
    pre-etch versions of autoconf, so we can be confident that no one is
    upgrading from a system that needs any of this.  (This was prompted by
    a spurious lintian complaint about install-info.)

autoconf (2.64-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add back Suggests: autoconf-archive removed in 2.64-3.  I did check
    whether that package still existed, but somehow I got it
    wrong--perhaps a typo.  Thanks to Guillem Jover <guillem@debian.org>
    for pointing out my mistake.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Sep 2009 13:31:40 -0700

    for pointing this out.  Closes: #548025.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Sep 2009 19:57:58 -0700

autoconf (2.64-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Require m4 version 1.4.13 or later for both build and installation.
    GNU m4 1.4.13 adds a "--gnu" option that Autom4te uses at runtime if
    it was found to work at build time, so these dependencies ensure
    consistency.  Thanks to Martin Casado <casado@nicira.com> for
    reporting the problem.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Aug 2009 11:45:01 -0700

  * The autoscan program no longer generates references to obsolete macro
    AC_FUNC_GETLOADAVG as of Autoconf 2.62, but this was forgotten in
    earlier uploads of Autoconf 2.62 and later.  Closes: #478476.

  * AC_MINIX no longer generates warnings.  Closes: #523391.

  * Erlang works again.  Closes: #454798.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jul 2009 19:58:29 -0700

autoconf (2.63-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Closes: #506102.

  * Uploading to experimental to avoid accidentally breaking dependent
    software prior to next Debian release.

autoconf (2.61-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Change dependency on automake | automaken back to a
    recommendation, based on discussion in BTS for bug #462021 and on
    debian-devel.  Also, suggest libtool and gettext because they are
    often used with autoconf (and invoked by autoreconf) but not nearly so
    often as automake.

 -- Ben Pfaff <pfaffben@debian.org>  Sat, 09 Feb 2008 17:59:10 -0800

autoconf (2.61-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Depend on automake | automaken, instead of just

  * debian/rules: Don't ignore all errors from "make distclean"; only

    (install): install SUPPORTFILES in acdatadir.
