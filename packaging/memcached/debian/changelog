memcached (1.4.13-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

   * Non-maintainer upload.
     + Include changes of my previous NMU (filed as #641770 back then)
   * Package new upstream release
     + this fixes "Please package upstream version 1.4.13" (Closes: #667746)
     + enable support for SASL authentication in debian/rules and add
       build-dependencies accordingly (Closes: #616148)
     + Include support for "-o maxconns_fast" which causes clients not to block
       for a long time on busy servers
   * Build package with hardened build flags. Thanks to Moritz Muehlenhoff for
     providing a patch. Moreover, add a build-dependency for dpkg-dev (>=
     1.15.7) for people considering to make a backport on very old systems
     (Closes: #655134)
   * Update patches:
     + 03_fix_ftbfs4hurd.patch: Refresh hunk offsets, leave changes untouched
     + Drop 04_fix_double_fork_in_start-memcached.patch: applied upstream
     + Apply patch supplied by Clint Byrum as 04_add_init_retry.patch which
       causes start-stop-daemon to wait up to 5 seconds upon termination of
       memached (Closes: #659300)

memcached (1.4.7-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Refresh patches, keep all changed hunks except some changes in
    `01_init_script_additions.patch' untouched.
  * New upstream release. Closes:
    - "FTBFS: memcached.c:1023:16: error: dereferencing type-punned
      pointer will break strict-aliasing rules" (Closes: #618096)
    - "ftbfs with gcc-4.6 -Werror" (Closes: #625397)
    - "FTBFS with libevent 2.0 in experimental" This is actually a duplicate
      of #625397 above (Closes: #632764)
    - Fix "please package new upstream release" (Closes: #641059)
  * Fix "Fix FTBFS on hurd-i386" add proposed patch as
    `03_fix_ftbfs4hurd.patch'. Thanks Svante Signell (Closes: #637695)
  * Fix "initscript on restart ignore $ENABLE_MEMCACHED" Add a sanity check
    to the init script (Closes: #636496)
  * Fix "debian/watch doesn't work" Replace the watch file to match the new
    Google Code layout (taken from the sinntp package) (Closes: #641520)
  * Add `04_fix_double_fork_in_start-memcached.patch'. This patch causes the
    start-memcached script to correctly write its PIDFILE, which, in turn,
    allows the init script correct operations. This also fixes "status
    operation on init.d not working correctly (needs to pass $PIDFILE to
    status_of_proc)", however add the $PIDFILE argument additionally none-
    theless as suggested (Closes: #622281)

memcached (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, primarily bugfixes, some of them critical, hence
    the urgency:
    - Reject keys larger than 250 bytes in the binary protocol.
    - Bounds checking on stats cachedump.
    - Binary protocol set+cas wasn't returning a new cas ID.
    - Binary quitq didn't actually close the connection
    - Slab boundary checking cleanup (bad logic in unreachable code)
    - Get hit memory optimizations
    - Disallow -t options that cause the server to not work
    - Killed off incomplete slab rebalance feature.
  * debian/patches:
    - 01_init_script_compliant_with_LSB.patch: Remade as upstream applied a
      whitespace cleanup script that broke the patch.
    - 02_manpage_additions.patch: Added missing parameters to the memcached
      manpage.
  * Removed TODO from debian/docs.

memcached (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #484301, #537239):
    - New binary protocol, supporting CAS (compare-and-swap).
    - Non-threaded version is no longer possible, you just choose to run 1
      thread to have similar behaviour.
    - Lots of performance bottlenecks fixed (connection starvation,
      contention, disabling of CAS, locks for hash table expansion...).
    - Lots of new stats.  Main change is that stats now are per-slab where
      possible.
    - Code cleanup, lots of bugs fixed, added tests, enhanced documentation.

memcached (1.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release, urgency=high because of two critical bugs prior
    to this release:
    - In 1.2.7 under multithreaded mode, memcached would never restart
      accepting connections after hitting the maximum connection limit.
    - Remove 'stats maps' command, as it is a potential information leak,
      usable if versions prior to 1.2.8 ever have buffer overflows discovered
      (CVE-2009-1494).  Closes: #526554.
    - Make -b command (setting the TCP listen backlog) actually work.
  * debian/rules: Removed obsolete --disable-static.
