samba (2:3.6.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

    NSS modules have been split out from libpam-winbind to
    libnss-winbind.
    
    If Recommends: installs are disabled on your system you may need
    to manually install the libnss-winbind package after upgrading
    from former versions of winbind (for instance from squeeze) or
    from former versions of libpam-winbind.

samba (2:3.5.11~dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

    PAM modules and NSS modules have been split out from the winbind
    package into libpam-winbind.
    
    If Recommends: installs are disabled on your system you may need
    to manually install the libpam-winbind package after upgrading
    from former versions of winbind (for instance from squeeze)

samba (2:3.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Default passdb backend changed in samba 3.4.0 and above
  
    Beginning with samba 3.4.0, the default setting for "passdb
    backend" changed from "smbpasswd" to "tdbsam".
    
    If your smb.conf file does not have an explicit mention of
    "passdb backend" when upgrading from pre-3.4.0 versions of
    samba, it is likely that users will no longer be able to
    authenticate.
    
    As a consequence of all this, if you're upgrading from lenny
    and have no setting of "passdb backend" in smb.conf, you MUST
    add "passdb backend = smbpasswd" in order to keep your samba
    server's behaviour.
    
    As Debian packages of samba explicitly set "passdb backend = tdbsam"
    by default since etch, very few users should need to modify their
    settings.

samba (3.0.27a-2) unstable; urgency=low

    Weak authentication methods are disabled by default

    Beginning with this version, plaintext authentication is disabled for
    clients and lanman authentication is disabled for both clients and
    servers.  Lanman authentication is not needed for Windows
    NT/2000/XP/Vista, Mac OS X or Samba, but if you still have Windows
    95/98/ME clients (or servers) you may need to set lanman auth (or client
    lanman auth) to yes in your smb.conf.

    The "lanman auth = no" setting will also cause lanman password hashes to
    be deleted from smbpasswd and prevent new ones from being written, so
    that these can't be subjected to brute-force password attacks.  This
    means that re-enabling lanman auth after it has been disabled is more
    difficult; it is therefore advisable that you re-enable the option as
    soon as possible if you think you will need to support Win9x clients.

    Client support for plaintext passwords is not needed for recent Windows
    servers, and in fact this behavior change makes the Samba client behave
    in a manner consistent with all Windows clients later than Windows 98.
    However, if you need to connect to a Samba server that does not have
    encrypted password support enabled, or to another server that does not
    support NTLM authentication, you will need to set
    "client plaintext auth = yes" and "client lanman auth = yes" in smb.conf.

samba (3.0.26a-2) unstable; urgency=low

    Default printing system has changed from BSD to CUPS

    Previous versions of this package were configured to use BSD lpr as the
    default printing system.  With this version of Samba, the default has
    been changed to CUPS for consistency with the current default printer
    handling in the rest of the system.

    If you wish to continue using the BSD printing interface from Samba, you
    will need to set "printing = bsd" manually in /etc/samba/smb.conf.  If
    you wish to use CUPS printing but have previously set any of the
    "print command", "lpq command", or "lprm command" options in smb.conf,
    you will want to remove these settings from your config.  Otherwise, if
    you have the cupsys package installed, Samba should begin to use it
    automatically with no action on your part.
