Description: Haskell data types to represent structured documents - GHC libraries
 This package ships the data types used by package Pandoc to internally
 represent structured documents. They've been split off from the main
 Pandoc package, so that other packages can use them without drawing in
 all the of Pandoc dependencies.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC.
