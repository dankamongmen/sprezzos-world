    - Fix spurious "dot" spoken in progression percentage speech synthesis, by
    using proper typography.
    - Add quotes around key strokes in help message so the speech synthesis can
    know it has to spell it, make it translatable and translate it in all
    languages the same way as it was done in other messages.

  * When FGETing a non-existing flag, return false, instead of an error. This

  * Set DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_* in dpkg-reconfigure to avoid confusing scripts
    using dpkg-maintscript-helper.

    This fixes some postinst scripts stalling.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3. No additional change required.
  * Lower priority of cdebconf-gtk to extra, same as cdebconf, to avoid the

    + Use GDK_KEY_* instead of GDK_*
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Factor common code in text frontend, fixing a memory leak.
  * dpkg-reconfigure.c : getfield() reads the status of packages by calling
    dpkg-query instead of manually parsing /var/lib/dpkg/status.
  * Add a symbols file for libdebconfclient0.
  * Stop shipping config and templates directories in /var/lib/cdebconf, which
    are unused.
  * Manage the special case of a metaget owners, returning a comma-separated
    list of the owners. It returned an empty string before.

  * Fix memory leak in text frontend.
  * Rework setting of values while running with a frontend, to use debconf-

  * Restore newt progress bar refactoring, this time with an extra tweak to
    tear down the old progress bar if you attempt to start a nested progress
    bar. (Don't do that; it's not supported and trying to use the outer
    progress bar after stopping the inner one will result in cdebconf
    silently sitting there at a black screen. However, partman-auto does
    this at the moment. See #391676.)

  * Move cdebconf binaries to /usr/lib/cdebconf, leaving symlinks in
    /usr/bin and /usr/sbin behind only in the udeb; drop
    /usr/share/debconf/confmodule and /usr/share/debconf/frontend from the

  * Added a new handler for single MULTISELECT questions to GTK frontend.
    Added also icons to NOTE and TEXT questions and introduced an hack

  * Initialise all fields of the gtk frontend data. Should fix several
    crashes.
  * Don't crash if display_dummy_main_menu() is called while we don't have a
    main-menu tag, e.g. if a progress bar is started before asking any
    questions at high priority. This is just a hack; Attilio needs to
    investigate the right solution. Reducing the amount of hardcoding of
    main-menu would be nice ...
  * Don't bother to save the target templatedb in debconf-copydb unless any
    templates were actually changed.
  * Make debconf-loadtemplate check whether each question is registered to
    some different template and, if so, re-register them to the loaded
    template. This causes preseeded-as-seen questions to be displayed using
    their real templates rather than debian-installer/dummy.

    - Stop hardcoding configdb and templatedb in stack database
      initialisation.
    - Use question_db_new instance parameter in debconf-copydb and
      debconf-dumpdb rather than messing with the DEBCONF_CONFIG environment
      variable.
    - Constify question_db_new instance parameter.
    - If DEBCONF_NO_I18N=1 is set in the environment, ignore localised
      fields in templates. This is a hack to let debconf-copydb and
      debconf-dumpdb work with template databases produced by debconf.
    - Look at config::instance::*::template to find out which template
      database to use when reading a given config database (which makes a
      difference for questions created using REGISTER). This is only used by
      debconf-copydb and debconf-dumpdb right now, and the global template
      database is retained as a fallback.
    - Add template instance for the debconf database in /target to the
      distributed cdebconf.conf, and associate it with target_configdb.
    - Remove assumption that RFC822 lines are no more than 8192 bytes long:
      the config entry for console-data/keymap/full violates that. In the
      process, consolidate the multiple duplicate definitions of
      unescapestr() and escapestr() into one place.
    - Merge old and new owner lists when setting a question in rfc822db,
      rather than overwriting the old owners. Add to-do entry for other
      databases.

    - Add draft plugins specification.
    - Append '\n' to debug messages automatically when printing to stderr,
      so that they aren't needed in every string.
    - Tidy up libdebconfclient namespace: rename debconf_commandf to
      debconfclient_commandf and make it static. Doesn't seem to affect any
      current users, and if it does, they should have been using
      debconf->commandf() instead.
    - Sync from debconf (closes: #266898):
      + Change the shell confmodule to not construct functions on the fly.
        The new code is smaller, a bit faster, and simpler, but the
        important thing is that it does not clobber $@. The old version
        messed up $@ if parameters contained spaces.
    - Add config instances for the standard debconf databases in /target, so
      that we can do 'debconf-copydb -p foo/bar configdb target_configdb'
      once the base system is installed.
    - Remove src/cdebconf.conf-dist on distclean.
    - Fix some of the build issues with the corba frontend, although it
      still doesn't even remotely build or work.
    - Fix compiler warning in slang frontend.
    - Allocate choices, choices_translated, defaults, and selected
      dynamically in slang frontend, fixing a crash bug.
    - Set up slang select/multiselect windows so that the first selected
      option is always visible (closes: #183541).

      with an underline, and only display a title if it's different from the

    - Add an INFO command, which may (depending on the frontend) display an
      out-of-band informative message. Unlike inputting a note, this doesn't
      require an acknowledgement from the user. Like PROGRESS INFO,
      frontends should display the info persistently until some other info
      comes along. In the newt frontend, this appears as text at the top
      left-hand corner of the screen; no other frontends implement it yet.
    - Fix text frontend segfault when encountering empty elements in Choices
      field (closes: #256557).
    - Fix memory leaks in METAGET, PROGRESS, and SETTITLE commands.
    - Make the text frontend output a blank line before the first title in
      go() if it was already displaying a progress bar (closes: #271707).
    - If possible, clean source directory in 'debian/rules clean' so that
      test builds don't make it into source packages.
    - cdebconf-udeb provides debconf-2.0.
    - Enable stack driver.
    - Move answers to password questions out of
      /var/lib/cdebconf/questions.dat to /var/lib/cdebconf/passwords.dat.
    - Some const-correctness improvements.
    - Add iterate methods to rfc822db, making debconf-copydb and
      debconf-dumpdb work (closes: #213266). This uses a horrible
      non-thread-safe technique involving building a temporary list with a
      pointer to each node in order, which will of course use a fair amount
      of memory, because the twalk() interface doesn't allow for anything
      better. If we ever switch to a completely different cache mechanism,
      this can go away.
    - Fix option parsing in debconf-copydb, debconf-dumpdb, and
      dpkg-reconfigure.
    - Implement -p/--pattern option in debconf-copydb and debconf-dumpdb.
      Note that, unlike Perl debconf, this takes an extended regular
      expression rather than a Perl regular expression, but it should be
      close enough for most uses.
    - Make --without-syslog-logging (a) work and (b) be the default. (The
      udeb build still uses syslog logging.)
  * Joey Hess
    - Apply patch from Denis to fix rfc822db to not output empty Value fields
      if the value is not set. Closes: #257180
    - Patch from mdz to support the DATA command, as used by the (perl)
      debconf passthrough frontend (as patched by mdz to work as of debconf
      1.4.42). This allows dpkg-reconfigure inside the chroot to communicate

    - Major improvements to the text frontend:
      + '\r' is not supported by all terminals, which made progress bars
        unreadable.  The display is now:
          Progress bar title ..20%..40%..60%..80%..100%
        Closes: #195704
      + Add support for backing up.  Closes: #183107
      + For most questions, prints the short description below the extended
        one.
      + String and passwd questions accept an empty answer.
      + A contextual help message is available at prompt.
      + Progress bar refresh is set to a minimum of 10% to prevent
        too verbose output.
      + Select and multiselect questions look now more like debconf
        readline questions.
      + Define a ISEMPTY macro to deal with empty strings on s390.
    - The previous fix about the seen flag broke when a package is
      left half-configured.  To prevent this problem, the seen
      flag is never written to the questions.dat file (for cdebconf-udeb
      only) as suggested by Joey Hess.  Closes: #229648

  * Denis Barbier
    - Steal code from debconf to go back over skipped questions.
      Closes: #225861, #229719
    - As locales are not installed during early stage of installation,
      sorting cannot be performed at run-time, and templates must
      contain sorting order.  Thus the Listorder fields is removed and
      replaced by a new Indices field.  If a template contains
        Choices: a, b, c
        Choices-ll.UTF-8: x, y, z
        Indices-ll.UTF-8: 3, 1, 2
      this means that 'a' is translated into 'x', 'b' into 'y' and 'c'
      into 'z' for the language 'll', but "z, x, y" is displayed in that
      order.
    - If frontend is set to 'none', a dummy frontend is initialized.
      This can be useful in conjunction with debconf-communicate, e.g.
      to fix #223344.
    - Only newt and text frontends are currently supported.  Do not
      build other packages (neither debs nor udebs), and strip build
      dependencies.
      The dependency problem caused by cdebconf-gtk-udeb goes away,
      and a solution is worked on in case this frontend is back later
      (which is the reason why these entries are not removed from
      debian/control), so there is no need to keep this bugreport open.

    - Add internationalization of the buttons in the newt frontend.
    - Hide the Go Back button instead of disabling it if backup is
      disabled. A proper fix for colour sets would be better, but
      this is less confusing for now.

      priority dynamically.
    - Add new command SETTITLE to make it possible to use translated
      titles. (Closes: #212923)

  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Update ru.po, patch from Serge Winitzki.
  * Steinar H. Gunderson
    - Make question_get_field always return a valid string, even when it

    - frontends/newt: When splitting up description and choices in two
      windows, make sure the user can back up to the description.
      (Closes: #188710)
    - Redesign the command functions to get rid of the space mangling.
      (Closes: #185014)
    - Add DEBCONF_OLD_{STDIN,STDOUT}_FD that point to the original stdin
      and stdout, to be used by console programs like starting a shell.
    - frontends/newt: Fix crash bug on double invocation of PROGRESS STOP.
    - frontends/newt: Change OK/Cancel to Continue/Go Back, and lay some
      ground work for i18n.
    - Redesign the progress API, see the docs. (Closes: #188243)
    - When asked the same question twice, ignore one of the questions to
      prevent looping. This is what perl-debconf does too.
    - Add a 'priority' member to the question struct that can be used by
      frontends.
    - frontend/newt: Show a "sigil" in the title that indicates the
      priority of the question. (Closes: #184816)

cdebconf (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Correct section of libdebconf1-dev from devel to libdevel to
      make sure it matches the override file in the debian archive.
    - Update /usr/share/debconf/confmodule to match the version in
      debconf 1.2.34.  This might solve the problem on disappearing
      whitespace.  The only difference left is the progress support.
    - Try to change the language imediately when debconf/language is
      set.
    - Add asserts() in question_get_field() trying to find out why
      cdebconf crashes.
    - Double the buffer used when loading templates.  This is a
      workaround for bug #188043, but the code should be rewritten
      to remove the limit.

    - The CAPB command now sets exactly the capabilities that were given as
      arguments. This makes it possible to turn of backup.
  * Denis Barbier
    - src/debconfclient.c: remove dependencies against common.h and
      strutl.h so that debconfclient.[ch] can be moved to a separate
      libdebconfclient package.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Reduce the priority from critical to medium when setting the

      are not reformatted were gobbled
    - finish support for backing up; names of seen questions are
      stored in a new member of confmodule, these questions are
      only marked as seen when session is over.
    - when SIGUSR1 is received, reads debian-installer/language value
      and sets LANGUAGE environment variable accordingly.
    - change progress bars interface: displayed strings are extracted
      from a template in order to help their l10n.
    - with text frontend, do not display title when question is
      skipped.  (closes: #177720)
  * Tollef Fog Heen:

    - check for value == NULL within command_get and command_metaget.
    - use default language for metaget.
    - add STRDUP_NOTNULL with the old behaviour of STRDUP. the client 
      doesn't expect a value of NULL.
    - add myself to Uploaders.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - Clean up function interface with l10n'ed fields: 'get' and 'set'
      functions in the template structure are no more used.
    - The getlanguage function is moved to template.c so that i18n is
      fully handled by template.c
    - Remove a superfluous trailing space in extended descriptions
    - Use LANGUAGE environment variable instead of DEBCONF_LANG.
      This variable is a colon separated list of languages.
    - Fix the textdb driver wrt localized fields
    - Support localized Default fields
    - There are now 2 ways to retrieve question values, question_getvalue(q,l)
      return either NULL or question value if it exists, and
      question_get_field(q,l,"value") always return a valid string.  With the
      latter, variable substitutions are also performed.
    - Add support for the DEBCONF_SHOWOLD environment variable.  Its default
      is currently "true".
    - Improve support of the 'seen' flag; dixit joeyh, flags should be
      set when closing session to help backing up, but it needs some
      extra work.
