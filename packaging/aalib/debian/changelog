  * Remove -l and -L from dh_shlibdeps call.

aalib (1.4p5-31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Jindrich Makovicka to make the curses driver behave better
    (and more like the slang driver) in its display of dim letters, by using
    black + bold instead of the dim attribute. The dim attribute is not
    supported by the linux console or by many X terminals. Closes: #406367

aalib (1.4p5-28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch watch file to use sf redirector.
  * Patch from Alastair McKinstry to drop aalib's private library deps from
    aalib-config --libs. Programs linking to aalib should now only need to
    link with -laa. This should also remove such innecessary dependencies from
    packages using aalib. Closes: #316740
  * Fix a typo in aalib-config.1
  * Patch from Alastair McKinstry to rename binary package names to fit
    policy: aalib1 -> libaa1, aalib1-dev -> libaa1-dev, aalib-bin -> libaa-bin
    Closes: #315418
  * All packages depending on aalib need to be updated and rebuilt for
    both the slang2 transition and the rename.
  * Temporarily includes an aalib1 dummy package, to avoid dependency
    headaches. Will be removed after everything is recompiled.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Jul 2005 10:28:20 -0400

aalib (1.4p5-27) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Apr 2002 20:05:19 -0500

aalib (1.4p5-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Have aalib1-dev depend on | slang1-utf8-dev; I guess that'll work.
    Closes: #140808

 -- Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>  Mon,  1 Apr 2002 12:45:28 -0500

aalib (1.4p5-11) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jan 2002 02:25:52 -0500

aalib (1.4p5-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Needs to build-dep on automake, Closes: #127209

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Dec 2001 16:29:11 -0500

aalib (1.4p5-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hacked configure (and ultimatly aalib-config) to not have gpm on the libs
    list. This lets aalib1-dev lose its dependancy on libgpmg1-dev (which is
    not available on the hurd). Programs like xaos that use the gpm mouse
    support will continue to have support for it; gpm is pulled in since the
    aalib library is linked to it. Closes: #102275
  * Reverted the changes of 1.4p5-4 since they are not now necessary (bb will
    shortly be fixed).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Dec 2001 23:15:50 -0500

  * Ship aalib.m4 in the -dev package. Closes: #115268

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Oct 2001 13:57:45 -0400

aalib (1.4p5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make aalib.h #include aaint.h, and include aaint.h in the -dev package.
    struct aa_context includes a struct parameters, which is defined in
    aaint.h. See #112039.
  * Updated some libtool files to work with current unstable libtool.

  * Use fname, not uninitilized tmp in linux_init(), Closes: #97695

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 21 May 2001 15:20:18 -0400

aalib (1.4p5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate, incorporating more of my changes
    among other things. The diff now consists of just the debian/
    directory.
  * Reverted change to aa_hardware_params, since Jan assures me C++ was
    fixed in another way.
  * Removed some cruft that crept into my cvs
  * Let debhelper 3 insert ldconfig calls into postinst automatically.
  * Added NEWS file to binary package.
 
 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  2 May 2001 19:48:55 -0400

aalib (1.4p4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-dep on libgpm1-dev only for [!hurd-i386], Closes: #95844

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Apr 2001 13:19:49 -0400

aalib (1.4p4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release! (Known upstream as 1.4rc4 -- it's a release
    candidate. Version mangling is so I can call the real release 1.4r.) 
  * The aa project is alive again, updated copyright file to point to
    new homepage.
  * Most of my changes have been accepted upstream now.
  * The new upstream release includes updated config.sub/guess files,
    so it should build on parisc now. Closes: #94794
  * Included .la file in -dev package.

aalib (1.2-w37) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Feb 2001 17:27:02 -0800

aalib (1.2-w35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with fixed dpkg-dev. Stupid dpkg..

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Jan 2001 14:14:45 -0800

aalib (1.2-w34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dependancies on several -dev packages that you will need
    to link anything with aalib.

aalib (1.2-w32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Libtool is not a fool (anymore), removed one gross hack, added a
    versioned build dependency.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Oct 2000 15:04:16 -0700

aalib (1.2-w31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Small changes to debian/rules to use debhelper v2.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Sep 2000 11:45:37 -0700

aalib (1.2-w30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Specified explicit option to dh_makeshlibs -V, so packages built with
    this version can be used in potato as well. Closes: #69965.
  * This package should superscede all other aalib package, including aalib
    packages built by third parties who messed with the version numbers in 
    decidedly nasty ways. That's why the -w(oody) is there.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Aug 2000 11:32:18 -0700

aalib (1.2-29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected aalib-bin symlink, Closes: #65828

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Jun 2000 15:59:40 -0700

aalib (1.2-28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed aalib-bin's section to misc (seems reasonable, as it's rather
    similar to bb, which is in there). This would fix bug #65766, but of
    course this change has no real effect unless the overrides file in
    modified too.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Jun 2000 15:35:08 -0700

aalib (1.2-27) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Jan 2000 15:25:29 -0800

aalib (1.2-25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-Depends on autoconf, libtool, because of a race condition: if you
    have a slow box, unpacking the source package may yeild a configure.in
    that in newer than configure, and so it automatically tries to update
    configure. Closes: #52313, #52172

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Dec 1999 08:25:15 -0800

aalib (1.2-24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dependancy on debhelper needs to be versioned.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Dec 1999 12:53:14 -0800

aalib (1.2-23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oh, it's just Build-Depends, not -Arch. How inconsistent. Closes: #51274

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Dec 1999 13:13:02 -0800

aalib (1.2-22) unstable; urgency=low

    non-orig .tar.gz to be uploaded.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Sep 1999 14:44:47 -0700

aalib (1.2-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated libtool for the hurd folks. Closes: #44535

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Sep 1999 10:54:54 -0700

aalib (1.2-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * FHS. Had to use versioned dependencies to make some of the doc dir
    symlinks always work. Lintian still complains -- sigh.
  * Use dh_installinfo, so info pages are FHS too.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Sep 1999 13:00:22 -0700

aalib (1.2-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up the rules file. Individual binary packages now each have
    their own target.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Sep 1999 20:47:04 -0700

aalib (1.2-16) unstable; urgency=low

aalib (1.2-13) unstable; urgency=low

aalib (1.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from edward@hairnet.demon.co.uk that allows you to hit a
    key to exit aafire (#Closes: 33385).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Feb 1999 13:47:56 -0800

aalib (1.2-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Commented out 2 lines in Makefile.in so automake isn't run. This
    prevents build problems on other platforms (#32415).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Feb 1999 12:37:26 -0800

aalib (1.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Wrote a manual page for all the programs in the -bin package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Feb 1999 16:27:48 -0800

aalib (1.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied a patch from Arjan Opmeer <a.d.opmeer@student.utwente.nl> that
    fixes a rather complex problem that was making aalib programs crash if
    aalib was built to use slang and the program was running in text mode
    in an xterm.
  * Re-enabled slang linkage now that all the bugs with it are fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jan 1999 11:56:24 -0800

aalib (1.2-8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed aacurses.c so it will actually build.
  * Fixed configure.in so slang can actually be disabled (typo).
  * Built with the curses driver instead of the slang one to work around
    whatever's making the slang driver badly fail. This fixes all apps that
    use aalib for display output, and it belongs in the frozen tree. (#27695)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Nov 1998 19:50:43 -0800

aalib (1.2-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Reupload to frozen. We need this so that other programs linked with
    aalib can be recompiled for ncurses 4. It was waiting in queue for slink
    when slink froze, and got installed into potato instead. :-(

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Nov 1998 12:37:22 -0800

aalib (1.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with ncurses 4.
  * Disabled building of libc5 compatability packages, they've never worked
    right and nothing uses them. (Since textdoom is stalled.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Oct 1998 14:34:47 -0800

aalib (1.2-5) unstable; urgency=low
