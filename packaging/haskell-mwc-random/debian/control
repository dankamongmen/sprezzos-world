Description: Fast, high quality pseudo random number generation
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
 .
 This package contains code for generating high quality random numbers that
 follow either a uniform or normal distribution. The generated numbers are
 suitable for use in statistical applications.
 .
 The uniform PRNG uses Marsaglia's MWC256 (also known as MWC8222)
 multiply-with-carry generator, which has a period of 2^8222 and fares well in
 tests of randomness. It is also extremely fast, between 2 and 3 times faster
 than the Mersenne Twister.
 .
 Compared to the mersenne-random package, this package has a more convenient
 API, is faster, and supports more statistical distributions.
