ptlib (2.10.2~dfsg-0ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Merge with Debian experimental. (LP: #836915) Remaining Ubuntu changes:
    - debian/rules: Configure with --enable-exceptions, to avoid
      -fno-exceptions leaking into pkg-config.
  * New upstream bug fix release
  * Drop pluginmgr.patch, dlclose_fix.patch: Included upstream.
  * debian/rules: Disable failing and rather dubious "compiled static" test,
    as this makes no actual effort of checking the binary. (The binary is
    really compiled dynamically)

    experimental)
  * Add pkg-kde-tools to take advantage of pkgkde-symbolshelper which is
    better suited for C++ libs - thanks to Modestas Vainius!
    (this makes c++ symbol files somewhat less painful. But still different
    g++ versions emit a bit different symbol sets so ftbfs'es happen)

    an error

  * Fix debian/watch to use sf.net instead of voxgratia.org (Closes: #453595)
  * Remove symlinks of unused compatibility versions.
  * Remove entire -ptrace and -debug build and leave only opt build with
    PTRACE code as new binary library. Discussion with Robert Jongbloed
    proved that there's no point shipping any other configuration.
  * Revert part of 04_names patch to not include OBJDIR_SUFFIX to

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3, no changes needed.
  * Remove doxygen from Build-Depends-Indep since it's present in
    Build-Depends.
  * Remove debian/backports/{sarge,dapper} since they are obsolete
    distributions.
  * Remove Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo and Santiago Garcia Mantinan from
    Uploaders and add myself.
  * Add all copyright holders to debian/copyright.

    website again.
  * Fixup debian/watch.
  * Remove compat symlinks.
  * Remove implicit rules-ignores-make-clean error
  * Fix dh_strip call to use $(PACKAGE) for all packs properly.
  * Add Homepage field as added in dpkg-dev 1.14.6.

  [ Faidon Liambotis ]
  * Adapt shlibs to depend on the upstream's version number and not the Debian
    version number, since we don't extend the ABI. This also imitates
    debhelper's behavior.

pwlib (1.10.7~dfsg1-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add missing libpt.so.* compat symlinks. The libpt.so.1.10 is supposed to
    be compatible with all build versions. Probably we should revert that
    SONAME "fix" upstream to just $major.$minor as is what Craig reckons is
    kept as API/ABI for a stable release. (Closes: #434077)
  * Urgency high due to RC bug.

pwlib (1.10.7~dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Update debian/rules to build also ptrace-enabled opt version and
    ptrace-enabled debug version (with extra PTRACE code) as was often
    requested by Ekiga developers.
  * Ship external debug symbols directly in new ptrace and develop package.
  * Add symlinks for linking only in libpt-dev rather than each libpt package.
    Backward compatibility links are still added to allow clean upgrade paths
    without rebuild when build-version has been bumped. Upstream reckons the
    API with stable OpenH323 releases (pwlib, opal, openh323) is supposed to
    remain identical for all upsates with the same minor version number.
    (Closes: #424050)
  * Depend on at least one plugin for audio and video for libpt-1.10.0. The
    -develop and -ptrace have their plugins included. No need to depend here.

  * Rename configure target to config.status
  * Updated Homepage to www.voxgratia.org in package descriptions
    (Closes: #383173)
  * Document that libpt-dbg is only debug symbols. Eventually this should
    become a switch in the debian/rules to make debug-compile one simple
    rebuild for the user or even automagically be added to more powerful
    platforms. (Closes: #345511)

pwlib (1.8.7-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * High-urgency upload for multiple RC bugfixes.
  * Fix casts to match current OpenSSL prototypes (closes: #335490).
  * Use -O2 instead of -Os when building, as recommended by policy; this
    fixes a build-time failure on alpha when running any code linked against
    libpt.
  * Drop the libpt.so.1.8.3 and libpt.so.1.8.4 symlinks; the native soname
    is now libpt.so.1.8.7, so since we're no longer compatible with older
    reverse-dependencies anyway due to the ABI change, these serve no
    purpose.  Here's hoping someone clues upstream in on handling of SONAMEs
    before the next release.
  * Rename libpt-1.8.3c2 to libpt-1.8.7 for the C++ mt allocator ABI
    transition, and conflict/replace libpt-1.8.3c2 accordingly
    (closes: #339253).  Thanks to the change above, this only requires
    conflict/replacing libpt-1.8.3c2 (>= 1.8.7-1).
  * Get rid of the useless /usr/lib/libpt.so.1 link: this serves no purpose
    when the package soname is libpt.so.1.8.7, because *nothing* will ever
    use it, so the easiest way to avoid conflicts is to not ship it
    anywhere! (closes: #331634)
  * Fix most of the warnings.
  * Thanks goes to Steve Langasek and Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo for their help
    on preparing this!

pwlib (1.7.5.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
     + drop debugshared and debugnoshared make targets. Those build hughe
     libraries, which are not needed in Debian.
     + Lot of changes to make -dbg package to only contain symbols that were
     stripped from shared library and plugins.
     + Both changes reduce the compilation time and the size of -dbg package.
  * debian/patches:
     + 07_nostrip: we don't want to strip when linking for shared library.
     That is going to be handled later in the package building process.

  * README.Debian: updated

pwlib (1.7.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Kilian Krause
     + New upstream update (Pandora)
     + make sure we're the only pwlib around while building and when
       installed
     + debian/rules: make sure the lib works before packaging it
     + debian/control: we need only doxygen, but as build-depends aswell as
     build-depends-indep. (see 218893 for details, 229357 holds a fix for
     dpkg, but isn't applied so far)

  * Jose Carlos
     + Merging versions and changes from 1.6.5-2 to 1.6.6.4-5
     + Added libkrb5-dev to Build-Depends: field.

pwlib (1.7.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Jose Carlos
    + New upstream version (Pandora)
    + We have Build-Dependencies declared on needed libs some time ago now.
    (Closes: #209130)
    + Build-Depend on libdc1394-10-dev (Closes: #255494)
    + debian/patches:
      - Set our patches for this version
      - 01_alpha: fixes compilation in alpha
      - 01_unix.mak: split in 01_alpha and 04_names
      - 03_getdate.tab: renamed from 03_src_ptlib_unix_Makefile
      - 04_Makefile.in: applied upstream. Removed
      - 04_names: change naming of libraries
      - 05_hppa: fixes compilation in hppa64
      - 06_plugins_shared: don't compile plugins for static targets
      - 10_video4dc1394.cxx: fixed upstream. Removed

    + debian/rules:
      - install ChangeLog from upstream sources
      - removed any reference to asnparser, which is no longer available
      - set compat to 1.7.5, as this version is again incompatible with older
      releases.

    + debian/control:
      - removed ansparser package
      - set package names to 1.7.5, and add Replaces to old libpt-1.6.3

    + debian/ChangeLog: removed

  * Kilian Krause
   + libpt-plugins-alsa now depends on alsa-base. (Closes: #257993)
   + debian/control:
      - we now need doxygen as new Build-Dep
   + debian/rules:
      - new plugins are called _pwplugin.so instead of only .so

pwlib (1.6.6.4-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo:
    - debian/patches/00list: removed HPPA "fix" as it broke compilation. HPPA is
      to be considered 32bit for userspace. 64bit is *ONLY* for kernel! (Closes: #266111)
    - debian/rules: using dpkg-architecture to properly detect in which
      architecture type we're being built. Upstream system is broken, and it
      is causing breakages depending on the buildd that pick us for compiling. 
      (Closes: #271531)
    - Urgency high as our goal is to put new pwlib/oh323 in Sarge.

  * Kilian Krause:
    - debian/control: dupe doc++ also in Build-Depends as we need it for the
      build target *sigh* (check #218893 for details, #229357 holds a patch
      for dpkg, but it's not applied still)

 -- Kilian Krause <kk@verfaction.de>  Sat, 18 Sep 2004 12:53:25 +0200

pwlib (1.6.6.4-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Recompile with new binutils to solve GM failure in hppa.
  * Urgency high as our goal is to put new pwlib/oh323 in Sarge.
  * make doc++ Build-Depends-Indep as it's only needed for libpt-doc

 -- Kilian Krause <kk@verfaction.de>  Tue,  7 Sep 2004 01:16:34 +0200

pwlib (1.6.6.4-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rebuilding to get right dependencies with libdv in
  libpt-plugins-avc (Closes: #267754)

pwlib (1.6.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream update:
     + Janus_patch4. Diverting from upstream versioning scheme, as this
     version is also called 1.6.6 from upstream POV.
     + Removed asnparser from package as it is no longer required.
  * debian/control: exclude all non-rtti enabled dependant programs from
    installing alongside the new rtti-enabled pwlib. Also, force pwlib to
    build without itself being installed (Just make sure, we're the only one
    around.)
  * debian/rules:
        - also update autotools in plugins/
        - try built pwlib before packaging
  * debian/patches/01_unix.mak.dpatch: fixed building on alpha. (somewhat this
    got lost along the way)

 -- Kilian Krause <kk@verfaction.de>  Mon,  9 Aug 2004 14:34:26 +0200

pwlib (1.6.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: alsa-base now recommends for libpt-plugins-alsa, not
    depends. (Closes: #263332)

 -- Kilian Krause <kk@verfaction.de>  Thu,  5 Aug 2004 13:33:30 +0200

  * Jose Carlos:
     + debian/patches:
         - 05_hppa: adds missing arch hppa in unix.mak

    Thanks to James Strandboge <jstrand1@rochester.rr.com> for providing
    the patch.  Closes: #233888.
  * Removed '-pipe', hopefully to get rid of bug #218841.
  * Dropping '-O2' optimisation, in favour of '-Os', to get smaller libs.
    Closes: #220885.

 -- Tim Johann <t1m@phrogstar.de>  Fri, 27 Feb 2004 17:18:24 +0100

pwlib (1.5.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * added -DP_64BIT flag to STDCCFLAGS on alpha, not accounted for upstream

  * New build mechanism uses autoconf
  * added man page ptlib-config.1
  * Added README.Debian

    closes: #198851.
  * Added patch, so that apps linked against ptlib ask for the full
    soname of the lib.
  * Simpler naming scheme.  The patch enabled us to just use
    libpt.so.$(Version) instead of libpt-$(Version).so.$(Version) .
  * complies standards vesion 3.6.0
  * debhelper version 4 compatibility

pwlib (1.4.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * IPv6 support doesn't seem to break IPv4, so we'll build with
    IPv6 support on all arches. Closes: #183484.
  * Adding IPv6 breaks binary compatibility so I bumped up soname.

 -- Santiago Garcia Mantinan <manty@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Mar 2003 23:23:06 +0100

  * New upstream version. Closes: #166792.
  * Changed to bison++ cause of bison problems with g++ 3.2.
  * Change 1394 support back to upstream style. Now programs wanting
    1394 support should define TRY_1394DC and build depend on

  * New upstream version.
  * Moved back into main.
  * Removed the 10 seconds timeout patch for sockets.
  * Patched with cvs to solve problems on GM with some cams.
    It took a lot for upstream to get this patch on cvs, which was
    the cause of the delay, waiting for upstream decision, sorry :-(

  * Changed the description a bit. Closes: #135524.

pwlib (1.2.5-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Patch to remove ALSA devices from the list of OSS compatibles.
    Fixes a bug on some ALSA systems, they need OSS compatibility
    modules to be OSS compatible, that way they will work with pwlib.

pwlib (1.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Heavily rewritten, we now allow several versions of the libs to
    be installed and I'll try to guess compatibility info and try to
    state that in the version numbering and shlibs of the package.
  * Reworked the -dbg package, it now has a shared version of the
    debug libs instead of two static identic ones. Fixed some bugs
    that could break compiling with debug activated.

 -- Santiago Garcia Mantinan <manty@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Nov 2001 21:39:18 +0100

  * Removed README.Debian explaining how to build the debug version.
  * Added more audio devices for the GnomeMeeting new features ;-)

pwlib (1.1.34-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the way on wich the source code is compiled. This results
    on asnparser being dynamically linked and thus much smaller now.
  * Compiled asnparser without -fPIC, this was what was breaking hppa.

  * Fix debian/watch to use sf.net instead of voxgratia.org (Closes: #453595)
  * Remove symlinks of unused compatibility versions.
  * Remove entire -ptrace and -debug build and leave only opt build with
    PTRACE code as new binary library. Discussion with Robert Jongbloed
    proved that there's no point shipping any other configuration.
  * Revert part of 04_names patch to not include OBJDIR_SUFFIX to
    plugins dir anymore.

  [ Faidon Liambotis ]
  * Incorporate NMU by Nico Golde, thanks! (Closes: #454139)
  * Fix bug where shlibs were very strict on binNMUed versions.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3, no changes needed.
  * Remove doxygen from Build-Depends-Indep since it's present in
    Build-Depends.
  * Remove debian/backports/{sarge,dapper} since they are obsolete
    distributions.
  * Remove Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo and Santiago Garcia Mantinan from
    Uploaders and add myself.
  * Add all copyright holders to debian/copyright.
  * Fix syntax error in the ptlib-config.1 manpage.

pwlib-titan (1.11.2-1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload by testing-security team.
  * Fix remote denial of service vulnerability caused
    by a call to PString::vsprintf if the used object already

pwlib-titan (1.11.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (unstable branch).

  [ Kilian Krause ]
  * Add dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.19) to Build-Deps to allow use of binary:Version.

    website again.
  * Fixup debian/watch.

  * Add Homepage field as added in dpkg-dev 1.14.6.

  [ Faidon Liambotis ]
  * Adapt shlibs to depend on the upstream's version number and not the Debian
    version number, since we don't extend the ABI. This also imitates
    debhelper's behavior.

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Sep 2007 14:43:52 +0200

pwlib (1.10.7~dfsg1-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add missing libpt.so.* compat symlinks. The libpt.so.1.10 is supposed to
    be compatible with all build versions. Probably we should revert that
    SONAME "fix" upstream to just $major.$minor as is what Craig reckons is
    kept as API/ABI for a stable release. (Closes: #434077)
  * Urgency high due to RC bug.

pwlib (1.10.7~dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Update debian/rules to build also ptrace-enabled opt version and
    ptrace-enabled debug version (with extra PTRACE code) as was often
    requested by Ekiga developers.
  * Ship external debug symbols directly in new ptrace and develop package.
  * Add symlinks for linking only in libpt-dev rather than each libpt package.
    Backward compatibility links are still added to allow clean upgrade paths
    without rebuild when build-version has been bumped. Upstream reckons the
    API with stable OpenH323 releases (pwlib, opal, openh323) is supposed to
    remain identical for all upsates with the same minor version number.
    (Closes: #424050)
  * Depend on at least one plugin for audio and video for libpt-1.10.0. The
    -develop and -ptrace have their plugins included. No need to depend here.

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Tue,  3 Jul 2007 21:49:46 +0200

pwlib (1.10.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Correct the versioned dependency to the lib we're building right now to
    overcome problems like #392522. Setting urgency=high, for we're closing an
    RC-bug.

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Oct 2006 11:05:39 +0200

pwlib (1.10.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. No more dfsg-repack should be needed, RFC files
    deleted upstream.

  [ Kilian Krause ]
  * Rename configure target to config.status
  * Updated Homepage to www.voxgratia.org in package descriptions
    (Closes: #383173)
  * Document that libpt-dbg is only debug symbols. Eventually this should
    become a switch in the debian/rules to make debug-compile one simple
    rebuild for the user or even automagically be added to more powerful
    platforms. (Closes: #345511)

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Oct 2006 13:27:28 +0200

pwlib (1.10.1.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kilian Krause ]
  * New upstream release. (Closes: #365177)
  * debian/rules: Use CURDIR rather than PWD to make sure we can build with
    sudo.

  [ Mark Purcell ]
  * Update debian/watch for numerics

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Jun 2006 19:33:41 +0000

pwlib (1.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Mar 2006 23:46:34 +0000

pwlib (1.9.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix compilation on alpha with switching -Os back to -O2. Apparently gcc is
    still broken.

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Feb 2006 22:10:42 +0100

pwlib (1.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Phobos-devel3, Prerelease for Ekiga 2.00 BETA2)
    Naming according to final API names of Phobos.

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Feb 2006 20:45:01 +0100

pwlib (1.8.7-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * High-urgency upload for multiple RC bugfixes.
  * Fix casts to match current OpenSSL prototypes (closes: #335490).
  * Use -O2 instead of -Os when building, as recommended by policy; this
    fixes a build-time failure on alpha when running any code linked against
    libpt.
  * Drop the libpt.so.1.8.3 and libpt.so.1.8.4 symlinks; the native soname
    is now libpt.so.1.8.7, so since we're no longer compatible with older
    reverse-dependencies anyway due to the ABI change, these serve no
    purpose.  Here's hoping someone clues upstream in on handling of SONAMEs
    before the next release.
  * Rename libpt-1.8.3c2 to libpt-1.8.7 for the C++ mt allocator ABI
    transition, and conflict/replace libpt-1.8.3c2 accordingly
    (closes: #339253).  Thanks to the change above, this only requires
    conflict/replacing libpt-1.8.3c2 (>= 1.8.7-1).
  * Get rid of the useless /usr/lib/libpt.so.1 link: this serves no purpose
    when the package soname is libpt.so.1.8.7, because *nothing* will ever
    use it, so the easiest way to avoid conflicts is to not ship it
    anywhere! (closes: #331634)
  * Fix most of the warnings.
  * Thanks goes to Steve Langasek and Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo for their help
    on preparing this!

 -- Kilian Krause <kilian@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Dec 2005 00:58:44 +0100

pwlib (1.8.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

pwlib (1.8.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

pwlib (1.8.4-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload (g++ transition).
  * debian/control:
    + Build-depend on libdc1394-13-dev instead of libdc1394-11-dev so that
      the package can build (Closes: #315233) and libpt-plugins-dc is
      installable again (Closes: #309873, #313032).
    + Removed the build-dependency on g++.
    + Renamed package to libpt-1.8.3c2 for the g++ transition (Closes: #310825).
  * debian/patches/08_g++4.dpatch:
    + Patch courtesy of Andreas Jochens to fix g++4.0 build.
  * debian/rules:
    + Copy config.sub and config.guess instead of linking them to allow the
      package to rebuild properly (Closes: #310813).

    + debian/rules: enabled support for v4l2. Created new plugin package.

  * Build-Depend on libdc1394-11-dev. (Closes: #277701, #278847)
  * Build-Depend on linux-kernel-headers to get video4linux2 support.

  * debian/patches:
    + 00list: disable 03_getdate.tab (Closes: #276200)

  * debian/rules: minor cleanups

  * Conflicts with libpt-1.6.3 and libpt-1.5.2. (Closes: #265447)
  * These are the new stable versions for pwlib. (Closes: #270061)

 -- Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo <jsogo@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Oct 2004 16:45:18 +0200

pwlib (1.7.5.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
     + drop debugshared and debugnoshared make targets. Those build hughe
     libraries, which are not needed in Debian.
     + Lot of changes to make -dbg package to only contain symbols that were
     stripped from shared library and plugins.
     + Both changes reduce the compilation time and the size of -dbg package.
  * debian/patches:
     + 07_nostrip: we don't want to strip when linking for shared library.
     That is going to be handled later in the package building process.

  * README.Debian: updated

 -- Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo <jsogo@debian.org>  Fri,  1 Oct 2004 20:48:52 +0200

pwlib (1.7.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Kilian Krause
     + New upstream update (Pandora)
     + make sure we're the only pwlib around while building and when
       installed
     + debian/rules: make sure the lib works before packaging it
     + debian/control: we need only doxygen, but as build-depends aswell as
     build-depends-indep. (see 218893 for details, 229357 holds a fix for
     dpkg, but isn't applied so far)

  * Jose Carlos
     + Merging versions and changes from 1.6.5-2 to 1.6.6.4-5
     + Added libkrb5-dev to Build-Depends: field.

 -- Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo <jsogo@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Sep 2004 20:02:51 +0200

pwlib (1.7.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Jose Carlos
    + New upstream version (Pandora)
    + We have Build-Dependencies declared on needed libs some time ago now.
    (Closes: #209130)
    + Build-Depend on libdc1394-10-dev (Closes: #255494)
    + debian/patches:
      - Set our patches for this version
      - 01_alpha: fixes compilation in alpha
      - 01_unix.mak: split in 01_alpha and 04_names
      - 03_getdate.tab: renamed from 03_src_ptlib_unix_Makefile
      - 04_Makefile.in: applied upstream. Removed
      - 04_names: change naming of libraries
      - 05_hppa: fixes compilation in hppa64
      - 06_plugins_shared: don't compile plugins for static targets
      - 10_video4dc1394.cxx: fixed upstream. Removed

    + debian/rules:
      - install ChangeLog from upstream sources
      - removed any reference to asnparser, which is no longer available
      - set compat to 1.7.5, as this version is again incompatible with older
      releases.

    + debian/control:
      - removed ansparser package
      - set package names to 1.7.5, and add Replaces to old libpt-1.6.3

    + debian/ChangeLog: removed

  * Kilian Krause
   + libpt-plugins-alsa now depends on alsa-base. (Closes: #257993)

   + debian/rules:
      - new plugins are called _pwplugin.so instead of only .so

pwlib (1.6.6.4-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Jose Carlos Garcia Sogo:
    - debian/patches/00list: removed HPPA "fix" as it broke compilation. HPPA is
      to be considered 32bit for userspace. 64bit is *ONLY* for kernel! (Closes: #266111)
    - debian/rules: using dpkg-architecture to properly detect in which
      architecture type we're being built. Upstream system is broken, and it
      is causing breakages depending on the buildd that pick us for compiling.
      (Closes: #271531)
    - Urgency high as our goal is to put new pwlib/oh323 in Sarge.

  * Kilian Krause:
    - debian/control: dupe doc++ also in Build-Depends as we need it for the
      build target *sigh* (check #218893 for details, #229357 holds a patch
      for dpkg, but it's not applied still)

 -- Kilian Krause <kk@verfaction.de>  Sat, 18 Sep 2004 12:53:25 +0200

  * Recompile with new binutils to solve GM failure in hppa.
  * Urgency high as our goal is to put new pwlib/oh323 in Sarge.

 -- Kilian Krause <kk@verfaction.de>  Tue,  7 Sep 2004 01:16:34 +0200

pwlib (1.6.6.4-3) unstable; urgency=high

pwlib (1.6.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream update:
     + Janus_patch4. Diverting from upstream versioning scheme, as this
     version is also called 1.6.6 from upstream POV.
     + Removed asnparser from package as it is no longer required.
  * debian/control: exclude all non-rtti enabled dependant programs from
    installing alongside the new rtti-enabled pwlib. Also, force pwlib to
    build without itself being installed (Just make sure, we're the only one
    around.)
  * debian/rules:
        - also update autotools in plugins/
        - try built pwlib before packaging
  * debian/patches/01_unix.mak.dpatch: fixed building on alpha. (somewhat this
    got lost along the way)

    closes: #198851.
  * Added patch, so that apps linked against ptlib ask for the full
    soname of the lib.
  * Simpler naming scheme.  The patch enabled us to just use
    libpt.so.$(Version) instead of libpt-$(Version).so.$(Version) .
  * complies standards vesion 3.6.0
  * debhelper version 4 compatibility

  * Changed to bison++ cause of bison problems with g++ 3.2.
  * Change 1394 support back to upstream style. Now programs wanting

pwlib (1.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Heavily rewritten, we now allow several versions of the libs to
    be installed and I'll try to guess compatibility info and try to
    state that in the version numbering and shlibs of the package.
  * Reworked the -dbg package, it now has a shared version of the
    debug libs instead of two static identic ones. Fixed some bugs
    that could break compiling with debug activated.

  * Upgraded vconvert.cxx and video4linux.cxx to cvs to fix video
    problems on some webcams. This will require some modifications
    on programs using video.
