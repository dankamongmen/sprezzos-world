Keyring handling
================

As a general rule, keyring requests arrive via Debian's RT, and we
usually ask people to open a ticket so it is kept as a reference. 

When you are working with a request, claim the ticket and set it to
the "open" state from RT's web interface.

Once it is done, send a message (either reply to RT's message on the
mail or via RT's web interface - taking care to use "reply" and not
"comment", to make it visible to the submitter) telling the change is
done in the working tree, and explaining we might take some time to
publish the changes - Something like this:

    The changes you have requested have been pushed to our working
    tree, and will be included in the next keyring push. Please be
    patient - We batch several requests together, and tend to do
    approximately one push per month.

The operations on keyring are on a separate file each, for ease of
reference. They are:

Adding a DD key      - keyring/adding_dd.txt
Removing a DD key    - keyring/removing_dd.txt
Updating a DD key    - keyring/updating_dd.txt
Adding a DM key      - keyring/adding_dm.txt
Promoting a DM to DD - keyring/dm_to_dd.txt
