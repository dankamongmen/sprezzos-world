  * debian/control: Conflict, Replace and Provide gpg-rsa & gpg-rsaref.
    Fix long description to reflect the fact that RSA is no longer
    patented and now included. [#72177]
  * debian/rules: move faq.html to /usr/share/doc/gnupg/ and remove FAQ
    from /usr/share/gnupg/.  Thanks to Robert Luberda

  * debian/control: Suggest new package gnupg-doc. [#64323, #65560]
  * utils/secmem.c (lock_pool): don't bomb out if mlock() returns ENOMEM,
    as Linux will do this if resource limits (or other reasons) prevent
    memory from being locked, instead treat it like permission was denied
    and warn but continue.  Thanks to Topi Miettinen
    <Topi.Miettinen@nic.fi>. [#70446]
  * g10/hkp.c (not_implemented): s/ist/is/ in error message.
  * debian/README.Debian: add a note about GDBM support and why it is
    disabled.  Upstream already fixed the manpage.  [#65913]
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): fix the Spanish translation to be 'es' not
    'es_ES' at Nicolás Lichtmaier <nick@debian.org>'s request. [#57314]
