  * Updated debian/libetpan13.symbols file with new symbols found by

    automatically now.

  * Add libexpat1-dev and libcurl4-gnutls-dev (>= 7.16.4-5) to Build-Depends

    Versioned dependency on libcurl4-gnutls-dev is because of #439317.
  * Updates in handling documentastion:
    - upstream tarball no longer provides txt documentation, only html,
      so no longer install API.txt.gz,
    - don't install README file since it does not contain useful information,
      only installation instructions,
    - don't install compiled tests into libetpan-doc package, which is
      Architecture: all,
    - install doc/depend.dot and doc/layer.fig files.
  * Fixes suggested by lintian:
    - -$(MAKE) distclean => $(MAKE) distclean
    - ${Source-Version} => ${binary:Version}

libetpan (0.34-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * 02-no-double-libdb.dpatch touches configure and configure.in, causing
    attempts to call autotools at beginning of build process. Avoid those
    attempts by altering Makefile.in. Also add 'sleep 1; touch ./configure'
    to patch) clause of 02-no-double-libdb.dpatch's code to avoid attempts
    to rebuild configure as (indirect) dependency of Makefile.
    (02-no-double-libdb.dpatch fixes invalid library version; this patch
    is temporary and most likely will disappear with next upstream. So there
    is no rationale to do 'correct' autotools handling, hacky way is ok here.)
  * Add a hack to debian/rules that patches generated libtool to avoid
    rpath in the library.

    against those libraries.
  * Thanks to Gerfried Fuchs <alfie@ist.org> for noticing the above problems

    for locking; added liblockfile-dev to Build-Depends.
  * Tweaked ./configure call in debian/rules as Gerfried Fuchs suggested.
  * Since this package is based on released version of the library, it's
    no longer needed to run auto* tools on build, so removed them from
    Build-Depends.
  * Release tarball contains pre-built documentation, so disabled
    documentation build, and removed jade and docbook-dsssl from Build-Depends.
  * Removed manual calls to install-docs from debian/libetpan-doc.{postinst,
    prerm} because debhelper adds those automatically.
