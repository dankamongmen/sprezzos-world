Daniel,

Although the proper way of adding case insensitivity to symbol lookup is 
still under discussion, I think it might be desirable to set the main 
function of Fortran programs to "MAIN__" first.  Because it can at least 
let GDB recognize that the language is Fortran after loading a Fortran 
executable only.  What is your idea on this?  Please comments.  TIA!

Here is the patch to set the main function in Fortran programs to 
"MAIN__".  And followed is a patch to verify this.  Tested with g77 and 
gfortran on x86, and g77 on ppc64.  With the first patch, it reported 
PASS; without, report FAIL.  No regression is found in gdb.fortran 
testcases.  

P.S: if there is a symbol named "MAIN__" in sources of other languages, it 
might disturb the debugging.  But I am not sure how much it is.
