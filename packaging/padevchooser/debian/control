Description: PulseAudio Device Chooser
 PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with
 much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.
 .
 This is a simple Gtk tool which registers an icon in the tray area and
 allows quick access to some features of the PulseAudio sound server.
 Specifically it can do for you:
 .
    * Notify about new sink/sources becoming available on the LAN
    * Quickly change the default PulseAudio sink/source/server assigned to
      the current X11 display, selecting devices available on the LAN
    * Start the auxiliary tools PulseAudio Volume Control, PulseAudio Volume
      Meter, PulseAudio Manager, PulseAudio Preferences
