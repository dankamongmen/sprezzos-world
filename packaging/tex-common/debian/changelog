  * Fix typography in Debian-on-TeX, thanks to Miguel de Val Borro

  * In the source package, replace 'tex-sed' with a Python script named
    'texify-tex-output' to do a better job (handling all known cases so
    far, some of which seemed rather difficult to implement in sed).

    We don't need to Build-Depend on Python, because this script is only
    used when we generate PDF output from the DebianDoc documents
    (Debian-TeX-Policy, TeX-on-Debian), which we don't do at build time
    in order to avoid chicken-and-egg problems. [florent]

  * Add engine subdirectories to the search paths for MetaFont and
    MetaPost, too.  Thanks to Jörg Sommer <joerg@alea.gnuu.de>

tex-common (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documentation fixes to update-fontlang.1:
      - the .TH line was broken, causing an ugly footer in the formatted
        manpage;
      - the SYNOPSIS had an incorrect syntax ('-language', '-updmap', and
        '-fmtutil' aren't optional) and the new way is much easier to read
        anyway IMO;
      - always mention the programs in that order: update-updmap,
        update-language and update-fmtutil (reason is, I think the average
        user is more likely to need update-updmap than any of the two
        others);
      - the arguments to some options were forgotten, as in the
        update-fontlang usage message ('--help');
      - better option formatting (for those with a short and a long form;
         copied from /usr/share/man/man1/man.1.gz);
      - the default values for TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR do *not* end with
        a slash;
      - the path to TeX-on-Debian.txt.gz was wrong;
      - s/updmap.sys/updmap.cfg/;
      - s/TEMXF/TEXMF/ in a few places;
      - a package may install *several* files in each /etc/texmf/*.d
        directory (and list them in the .list files under
        /var/lib/tex-common).
      - a bit more details here and there;
      - more formatting to ease reading (such as italics), punctuation,
        typographical fixes. [florent]

  * Fix to update-fontlang: don't forget the arguments to '-c' and '-o' in
    the usage message ('--help'). [florent]
  
  * Minor fixes to postrm-texlsr to avoid having too long lines (greater
    than 80 characters). [florent]

  * remove the left-over definition of dhit_check_run_without_errors in
    postrm-tex, it is included in postrm-texlsr (Closes: #402068). [NP]

  * Depend on debconf (>= 1.4.69), which introduced the error template

  * Fix format extraction regexp in dh_installtex, the format name must
    now be at the beginning of the line, without any leading whitespace,
    but hyphens are allowed in the name.  Thanks Ralf. [preining]
  * dh_installtex: Include only the minimal mktexlsr code in case no other
    installation is done (ie no maps, formats, languages).  Also add the
    ability to specify texmf trees on the command line, and only recreate
    the ls-R DB for /usr/share/texmf and /var/lib/texmf [preining]
    (Closes: #392359)
  * Add engine-specific paths to the TEXFORMATS and TEXFONTMAPS variables,
    and avoid triple slashes.  This is completely backwards-compatible (it
    only adds path components), and is needed for the planned separate
    context package.  Thanks to Ralf Stubner for the details!

  * Move and extend the teTeX README.Debian to TeX-on-Debian Documentation

  * adapted sanity check in update-fontlang to TEXMFSYSCONFIG = /etc/texmf

  * Provide a tetex-bin-update script.  This allows also texlive to
    properly rename an old tetex-bin conffile, and add the magic comment,
    and is therefore needed for a transition from teTeX to TeXlive without
    upgrading teTeX to the etch version first [frank]
  * Install debianize-updmap into the scripts dir [frank]
  * Provide the debianize-updmap functions in /usr/share/tex-common, for
    usage by all TeX systems in Debian [frank]
  * Changed the order of trees in TEXMFDIST.  If TeXlive and teTeX
    packages are installed together, files from TeXlive now take
    precedence.  This makes sense because those files are usually
    newer. [frank]

  * On systems upgraded from woody to sarge, tetex-bin generated a bogus
    local configuration file with entries that were erroneously detected
    as locally changed.  These entries are now harmful and break texlive,

  * update-fontlang:  If a conffile has a corresponding dpkg-new file,
    that is, it is from a yet-unconfigured package, drop it any case.
    Previously, the check was only done when the file had a magic comment,
    but conffiles in sarge generally do not have this magic.  Therefore,
    upgrades from sarge would have failed if the conffile change is needed for
    proper configuration (closes: #389550) [frank]

  * Policy Change:  Treat configuration files properly as Debian Policy

    maintainers to only treat files for site-wide changes as configuration
    files, not files intended to change the typeset output on a
    per-document or per-project basis.  Consequently, mktex.cnf is now
    installed as /etc/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf.  Thanks to Manoj Srivastava!

tex-common (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restore the previous behavior by making the subdirectories of
    /var/cache/fonts world-writable by default.  Since this is unsafe,
    advice the user in the debconf template, and increase the question's
    priority to medium.  Thanks to Lars Wirzenius, closes: #354113.

    We do not fix existing systems, since this is mainly targeted at
    pbuilder environments and similar, where tex-common is only installed
    on demand.  [frank]
  
  * fix an error in dh_installtex when grepping for the magic header [ralf]
  * Add an md5sum for psfonts.ams, thanks to Andreas Tille [frank]

      #351649, #352486) [frank]
    - Also add some forgotten md5sums for tetex-base, and make sure scripts
      really stop if the md5sum is unknown (closes: #352688) [frank]
    - remove LaTeX and pdfLaTeX format files before trying to recreate all
      format (closes: #352391, #346135, #352569) [frank]
    - use different variable names for /var/lib/texmf as a texmf.cnf
      variable and as a maintainer script variable [frank]
  * rework debconf usage (Closes: #352394) [preining,frank]
    - only care for ls-R file permissions of the font cache from now on

    - document dh_installtex and some additional checks needed in
      maintainer scripts [florent]
    - Clarify that some files from the Basic TeX Packages stay in
      TEXMFMAIN [frank]

 -- Frank Küster <frank@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Feb 2006 13:43:32 +0100

tex-common (0.15) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high, because this version adds important checks that should
    be present when the teTeX packages enter testing
  * Add more checks for essential entries in texmf.cnf, and bail out with
    a user-friendly error message if they are missing (closes: #346326)
    [frank]
  * Fix functions in common.functions.in, so that old conffiles of teTeX
    are properly handled, thanks to Ralf Stubner
  * Drop unneeded paths from TEXFONTMAPS, we now have only 3.0's upstream
    value plus our backward-compatibility paths; also change the check in
    the postinst accordingly (although the old one would still work, we do
    not allow it for simplicity's sake). [frank]
  * Fix typo in dh_installtexfonts which would echo wrong file names, and
    add --quiet to the call of update-updmap in the debhelper scripts
    [preining]
  * Again fixed extensions of files to purge, and take over correct
    language.dat handling from tetex-base (see: #321804). [frank]
  * Move the handling of 00updmap.cfg from postinst to preinst, where it
    belongs [frank]
  * Fix typo in manpage for update-language, thanks to Nicolas François

tex-common (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * tex-common now provides the symlink /usr/share/texmf/doc -->
    ../doc/texmf, because tetex-doc now puts its files into TEXMFDIST
    [frank].
  * Do no longer install teTeX's common.* files and dsf-patch.mk, they are
    no longer used.
  * Implement --flavor for dh_installtexfonts, first flavors are only
    for generating config files for maps [preining].
  * Fix brace expansion in pdksh, patch from Robert Luberda 
    (closes: #342781) [preining]
  * Add fonts/hbf to the search path for T1 fonts, this is needed by
    cjk-latex. [frank]

    - Update Czech debconf translation, thanks to Miroslav Kure
      <kurem@upcase.inf.upol.cz> (closes: #341941) [frank]

tex-common (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for correct setting of TEXFONTMAPS after possible user
    interaction in postinst, and fail with a clear error message, instead
    waiting for teTeX's or TeXLive's updmap calls to fail (closes maybe:
    #338585) [frank]
  * Add a function clean_texenvironment to common.functions, to be used
    from TeX package's postinst scripts, and document that in the Policy
    document. [frank]
  * Add the md5sum of the postinst-edited 00updmap.cfg to ucf's database.
    Also fix the logic for taking over changed settings from tetex-base,
    and create 00updmap.cfg with proper permissions.  Special thanks to
    Junichi Uekawa <dancer@netfort.gr.jp> for insisting (closes: #335682,
    #338689) [frank]

tex-common (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * tex-common should only Suggest debhelper, not Depend on it. It would

  * In postinst, create nonexistent ls-R files with proper magic content
    if they are not already present (closes: #337073) [frank]
  * The config script was not idempotent, and reset the debconf default
    for group writable ls-R files on a fresh install. [frank]
  * Remove the ls-R symlink in TEXMFLOCAL, thanks to Lars Wirzenius

tex-common (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change ls-R file handling to be useful. Don't use debconf as
    registry. (Closes: #332264) [preining]
  * install debhelper dh_installtexfonts script (closes: #320147) [preining]
  * A few changes to update-fontlang, most notably that it will now check,
    when invoked as update-updmap, whether /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
    exists and abort with an explanation in that case. [florent]

  * Change hyph_size to 8191 - according to DEK it should be a prime
    number.  [frank]
  * Add a (closes:...) to the last version's changelog entry to make
    tracking history easier, in fact the bug has been closed manually
    [frank]. 
  * fix update-texmf to not go into an endless loop when called with an
    unknown option [frank]
  * Modify postrm.in script to remove TEXMFSYSVAR and /var/cache/fonts
    (thus also removing left over files at purge time) [preining]
  * manage ls-R files using debconf [preining].  The translations have
    been copied over from tetex-bin [frank]. (Closes: #328291)
  * Let the debconf dependency be created by debhelper, thus allowing
    debconf-2.0 as an alternative [frank] (closes: #332115)
  * In fact install the pdf version of the Policy draft, but include it in
    the tar.gz file.  Thus we can drop the Build-dependency on
    tetex-extra.  A working TeX system is only needed on the developer's
    system if the policy source has been changed.

    fixed location of memory files in update-updmap

tex-common (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * provide an upgrade path for the configuration items taken over from
    tetex-base 
  * Add a versioned conflict on tetex-base - they would remove our
    00updmap.cfg file.
