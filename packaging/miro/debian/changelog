  * Switch to the new boost 1.37 packages as build-dependencies (needed for
    the Debian package of libtorrent-rasterbar anyway).
  * debian/60_boost_mt.patch: Add file, boost 1.37 only provides -mt variant.
  * Use common-install-prehook-arch target to remove the unneeded

miro (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Fixed: Java browser plugin problems upon upgrade (Closes: #461990).
    + Now deactivates (GNOME) screensaver during playback (Closes: #441411).
    + Youtube downloads work fine again (Closes: #506723).
    + The Miro icon cache is a lot smaller now (Closes: #493943).
  * debian/patches:
    + 10_movies_dir.patch: Updated.
    + 20_no_autoupdate.patch: Updated.
    + 30_disable_xine_hack.patch: Updated.

    + sqlitedb appears to have been corrupted (Closes: #497504).
  * debian/control:
     + Don't use duplicate package descriptions (lintian).
     + Add ${misc:Depends} to all binary packages (lintian).
     + Drop no longer needed dependencies on imagemagick and chrpath.
     + Make 'python-psyco' a Recommends instead of Suggests as it allows
       for potential application speed-ups.
     + Suggests: python-notify (optional).
     + Add Conflicts with miro-data (<< 1.2.1) (see Ubuntu LP #296175), as
       the miro.desktop file moved from miro-data to the miro package there.
     + Turn all gstreamer-related dependencies into Suggests for now, in order
       to make a smaller Miro install possible (e.g. on netbooks, where disk
       space is often a scarce resource). Xine is still the default renderer
       in the Debian package, so the xine libs are a requirement. If you want
       to use gstreamer instead, you have to install the Suggests packages.
       There's documentation in README.Debian for that.
     + While we're at it, add gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad and also
       gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly as Suggests.
  * debian/rules:
     + Invoke dh_desktop as we install a *.dektop file (lintian).
     + Clear DEB_PYTHON_CLEAN_ARGS, as Miro's setup.py doesn't know about
       the default argument '-a', which cdbs tries to use upon 'clean'.
     + Update list of files to remove in the 'clean' target. 
     + Install README.gtk-x11 and README.cli documentation files.
  * debian/README.Debian:
     + Add hints on how to use gdb with 'miro --debug' for debugging.
     + Add HOWTO for installing gstreamer stuff if you want to switch the
       renderer from xine to gstreamer.
     + Drop obsolete items.

miro (1.2.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add build dependencies on a base set of gstreamer plugins, so that
    users who want to use gstreamer instead of xine can safely do so:
    gstreamer0.10-plugins-base, gstreamer0.10-plugins-good, gstreamer0.10-x,
    gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg.
  * Disable the "xine hack" in Miro. This has been identified to fix a
    reproducible segfault after a video ends (Closes: #512719).
    Please report if disabling the "xine hack" causes any problems.
    An alternative fix seems to be to switch to gstreamer as backend in
    Miro's options dialog (and restart Miro).
  * Closing unreproducible bugs. Please reopen if you can reproduce the
    problem with the latest version.

     + Youtube video downloads should work again, see upstream bug
       http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10656.
     + Closing unreproducible (with the latest release) bugs:
        + MIRO NOT WORKING (Closes: #502194).
          Both the feed mentioned and video search is working fine.
        + NBC News podcast corrupted if download is resumed (Closes: #496233).
          Works fine with both, Miro 1.2.8, and mplayer. Must have been some
          oddness with the feed itself.
        + miro (version 1.2.3-2) segmentation fault (Closes: #489891).
          No longer occuring according to the BTS, never reproducible by me.
        + miro: If the XVideo extension is missing, video has wrong colors and
          extremly low framerate (Closes: #459069, #473310).
          This problem goes away if you use 'miro --xine-driver=xhsm' and will
          not be relevant soon anymore, as Miro switches to gstreamer
          upstream with the next major release. Added a note to README.Debian.
        + [miro] Crash on startup (Closes: #500061).
          Unreproducible by me, reporter says the problem was not Miro-related.
  * debian/miro.lintian-overrides: Added file. Silence lintian warning about
    an embedded version of 'feedparser'. We cannot use the Debian package
    of 'feedparser' as Miro uses a highly modified version of it.
  * debian/rules: Remove more files in the 'clean' target.

  * Standards-Version: 3.8.0 (no changes required).
  * Depend on python-gtkmozembed instead of python-gnome2-extras as we only
    use the gtkmozembed module (Closes: #485295).
  * Close bugs which are no longer relevant:
     + Miro does not really depends on libxine 1.1.12 (Closes: #480867).
     + Miro doesn't work since recent upgrade of python (Closes: #481574).
       This has been likely fixed in Python >= 2.5.2-6, so bump dependencies.
  * Add explicit build-dependency on pkg-config.

  * debian/copyright: Update.
     + Drop platform/gtk-x11/coverage.py section, file has been removed.
  * debian/control:
     + Drop 'Recommends: libxine1-ffmpeg', we depend on it via libxine1-plugins.
     + Move from 'optional' to 'extra' as we depend on libxine1-plugins
       which is also 'extra'.
     + Make python-dbus a dependency, no build-dependency.
     + Force xulrunner to be >= 1.8.1.14 to get the latest security fixes.
  * Not reproducible in the current release, thus closing:
     + "esddsp democracyplayer" causes "Bus error" (Closes: #413681).
       I verified that this works fine now, addeds docs to README.Debian.

miro (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #473139).
     + There's a default autodownload setting option now (Closes: #439076).
     + Torrents have a download speed limit options now (Closes: #387716).
     + debian/patches/10_movies_dir.patch: Update.
     + debian/patches/20_no_autoupdate.patch: Update.
     + debian/patches/30_de_po_typo.patch: Drop, merged upstream.
     + debian/patches/50_xine_extractor_path.patch: Update.
  * Switch to building for Python 2.5, as Python 2.4 has been removed
    from the archive (Closes: #476159, #476486, #445249).
  * Build-depend on libffi-dev which is an extra package now (Closes: #472158).
  * debian/patches/80_gcc-4.3_headers.patch: Add file, which fixes
    compile errors with gcc 4.3 (Closes: #466757). Thanks
    Arthur Loiret <arthur.loiret@gmail.com> for the patch!
  * debian/menu: Add xpm icon for displaying in the Debian menu.
  * Closing a bunch of bugs which I cannot reproduce in the latest release:
     + miro: DbusException when starting (Closes: #466011).
     + miro: Segfault when switching to Library during video
       playback (Closes: #472327). Please reopen if you can reproduce this
       multiple times in a row with the latest version.
     + Insufficient version dependency for python-gtk2 (Closes: #443101).
     + miro: UI freezes on keyboard input (Closes: #459039).
  * Add python-gst0.10 dependency as Miro now supports switching the
    renderer from xine to gstreamer via the Options menu (Closes: #466337).
  * debian/patches/90_disable_iheartmiro_nag.patch: Added. This disables
    the annoying nag screen to download and install the iHeartMiro Firefox
    plugin. For a manual installation see http://www.iheartmiro.org/.
  * Force xine to be >= 1.1.12 to get all the latest security fixes.
  * Force xulrunner to be >= 1.8.1.13 to get all the latest security fixes.
  * Add dependency on libxine1-plugins (thus also on libxine1-ffmpeg), as
    we really want to be able to play all formats.
  * Install xine_extractor into /usr/lib/miro, not /usr/libexec.

miro (1.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Provide "real" transitional packages for democracyplayer -> miro upgrades.
  * Enforce dependency on xulrunner >= 1.8.1.12-2 so we get all the recent
    security fixes in xulrunner, plus GNU/Hurd and GNU/kFreeBSD support.
  * Closing some more bugs I cannot reproduce in this version, in order to
    allow miro to transition to testing. If you still see the same problems
    in the latest release, please reopen as non-RC bugs. Having a version in
    testing which works for most people is better than no version at all.
     + miro crashes when done playing a video (Closes: #464862).
     + miro crashes on playing a video or audio podcast (Closes: #462706).
  * Finish transition of debian/copyright to machine-readable format.

miro (1.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add missing build-dependencies on ssl-dev, libboost-filesystem-dev,
    libboost-thread-dev, libboost-serialization-dev, and
    libboost-date-time-dev (Closes: #465670).
  * Add missing dependency: imagemagick.
  * Closing some more bugs I cannot reproduce in this version.
    Please reopen if the problem persists.
     + Doesn't start anymore, unless some KDE app is running (Closes: #399097).
     + Solarization effect when playing videos the second time. This looks
       like a driver or xine bug, not a Miro bug (Closes: #375911).
     + Eats up all CPU time (Closes: #453647).
  * debian/copyright:
     + Start to convert the file to the machine-readable format described
       at http://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat (not yet finished).
       Based on the work done in the Ubuntu package (thanks!).
     + Further updates, add missing items.

 -- Uwe Hermann <uwe@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Feb 2008 02:39:06 +0100

  * Fix problem with multiple "crash report" windows popping up without
    a real crash happening (Closes: #451980, #452708, #454603, #452486).
  * Honor --xine-driver option (Closes: #453406).
  * debian/control: Add Homepage field.
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes required).
  * xine-lib transition: Add explicit dependency on libxine1-x.
  * Small fixes to reduce the diff to the Ubuntu package:
    + Use $(DEB_PYTHON_COMPILE_VERSION) instead or hard-coding the
      version number (but still use 2.4 in Debian for now).
    + debian/control: Split long lines for better readability.
    + Add watch file.

 -- Uwe Hermann <uwe@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Dec 2007 13:15:20 +0100

miro (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #449131, #451207).
    + Fixed malformed miro.xml file (Closes: #445871, #443510).
    + Drop several patches which were applied upstream.
  * Add missing libxv-dev build-dependency (Closes: #442832, #443006, #443045).
  * Miro shipped with a menu file since the beginning (Closes: #443211).
    It's currently in the 'Applications/Network/Web News' category.
  * Fix small typo in German translation (Closes: #451333).
  * Cannot reproduce the following bugs with this release. Please
    reopen if you still experience problems:
    + Miro crashes on play (Closes: #443266).
    + Used to work; now segfaults on startup (Closes: #444484).
      Please try removing the ~/.miro directory if the problem persists.
    + Segfault on startup (quicktime related?) (Closes: #444051).
    + Cannot install Miro (Closes: #443045). Unlikely to be a real bug,
      probably stems from mixing packages from stable/unstable.
  * New 'Recommends: libxine1-ffmpeg'.

 -- Uwe Hermann <uwe@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Nov 2007 02:11:55 +0100

miro (0.9.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #433752).
     + Democracy Player was renamed to Miro upstream, so we now
       use Provides/Conflicts/Replaces to transition existing installs.
     + Update the package description (and improve it a bit).
     + Now supports proxy settings (Closes: #426992). Miro uses the
       default GNOME proxy, which you can set/enable using gconf-editor.
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Several improvements inspired by the Ubuntu version of the package:
    + Remove unneeded RPATH from MozillaBrowser.so (using chrpath).
    + debian/menu: Move package into 'Applications/Network/Web News'.
    + Drop shebang from feedparser.py, not needed (and silences lintian).
    + Only suggest python-psyco on [i386 hurd-i386 netbsd-i386 kfreebsd-i386].
  * miro.desktop improvements:
    + Drop 'Encoding=UTF-8', no longer necessary (lintian).
    + Change categories to 'AudioVideo;FileTransfer;News;P2P;TV;Player;'.
  * Cannot reproduce the following bugs using this release of Miro.
    Please feel free to reopen if it's still a problem.
    + "Crashes on stop playback" (Closes: #399098).
      According to http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5197
      this is indeed fixed in Miro 0.9.9.1.
    + "Still crashes". Cannot reproduce with Miro (Closes: #438946).
    + "Crashes on end of video podcast" (Closes: 419207).
      Doesn't seem to happen with latest Miro anymore (I did see it before).
    + Installation error. Can't reproduce, no further infos from submitter,
      so I'm closing this. (Closes: #387248).
    + "Crash after pressing play". Cannot reproduce (Closes: #402264).
    + "Position slider doesn't respond to mouse click-and-drag sometimes".
      Cannot reproduce with latest Miro (Closes: #405248).
    + "Freezes On Start". Cannot reproduce with last Miro (Closes: #408032).
      Also, running two instances seems to work fine for me, but it's
      not really useful or recommended.
    + Problem with xine plugin. Doesn't look like a Democracy Player / Miro
      issue, but please reopen if it still happens (Closes: #420144).

democracyplayer (0.9.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Night of the Living Dead" release.
  * Fix critical python/dbus errors (Closes: #429881, #418722).
    Thanks Krzysztof Sobiecki <sobkas@gmail.com> for the patch!
  * Build-depend on libboost-python-dev (>= 1.34.1-2), as that version is
    now built with Python 2.4 again, which is currently needed to make
    Democracy Player work at all (Closes: #430659, #429407).
    Note that we _have_ to build democracyplayer with Python 2.4 at this
    point in time, as several of its dependencies are not yet available
    as Python 2.5 versions in Debian.
  * Build-depend on libxine-dev (>= 1.1.6-2), as starting with that version
    xine plays sound/music in *.flv flash files (Closes: #396898, #387726).
  * Drop 30_libboost_python.patch, no longer needed.
  * Add new required dependency: python-pysqlite2.

  * New upstream release.
    + This fixes a critical dbus-python related bug (Closes: #422899).

    libboost-python1.33.1 is lo longer in the archive (Closes: #428124).
  * Fix a libboost-related FTBFS (Closes: #427912).
  * Fix FTBFS: /bin/sh: python2.5: command not found (Closes: #423754).

  * Acknowledge NMU, thanks Margarita Manterola <marga@debian.org>
    (Closes: #401569). Upstream integrated the translation updates and fixes
    AFAIK, but if not please re-open (but please submit further fixes
    upstream: https://launchpad.net/democracy/trunk/+pots/democracyplayer).
  * Re-introduce the changelog entry from 0.9.1-1 which somehow got lost
    (don't ask me how _that_ happened!). See #402262.
    Thanks Margarita Manterola <marga@debian.org>.
  * Build-Depends: python-support (>= 0.6), as we use 'Python-Depends' now.
  * Build-Depends: python-dbus (instead of python2.4-dbus).
  * Suggests: python-psyco (improves speed a bit).
  * Simplified packaging a bit.

    in the installed package, so we can save some space here.
