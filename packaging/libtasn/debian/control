Description: Manage ASN.1 structures (development)
 Manage ASN1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) structures.
 The main features of this library are:
   * on-line ASN1 structure management that doesn't require any C code
     file generation.
   * off-line ASN1 structure management with C code file generation
     containing an array.
   * DER (Distinguish Encoding Rules) encoding
   * no limits for INTEGER and ENUMERATED values
 .
 This package contains header files and libraries for static linking.
