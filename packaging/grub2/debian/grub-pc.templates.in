_Description: Chainload from menu.lst?
 GRUB upgrade scripts have detected a GRUB Legacy setup in /boot/grub.
 .
 In order to replace the Legacy version of GRUB in your system, it is
 recommended that /boot/grub/menu.lst is adjusted to load a GRUB 2 boot
 image from your existing GRUB Legacy setup. This step can be automatically
 performed now.
 .
 It's recommended that you accept chainloading GRUB 2 from menu.lst, and
 verify that the new GRUB 2 setup works before it is written to the MBR
 (Master Boot Record).
 .
 Whatever your decision, you can replace the old MBR image with GRUB 2
 later by issuing the following command as root:
 .
 upgrade-from-grub-legacy

_Description: GRUB install devices:
 The grub-pc package is being upgraded. This menu allows you to select which
 devices you'd like grub-install to be automatically run for, if any.
 .
 Running grub-install automatically is recommended in most situations, to
 prevent the installed GRUB core image from getting out of sync with GRUB
 modules or grub.cfg.
 .
 If you're unsure which drive is designated as boot drive by your BIOS, it is
 often a good idea to install GRUB to all of them.
 .
 Note: it is possible to install GRUB to partition boot records as well, and
 some appropriate partitions are offered here. However, this forces GRUB to
 use the blocklist mechanism, which makes it less reliable, and therefore is
 not recommended.

_Description: GRUB install devices:
 The GRUB boot loader was previously installed to a disk that is no longer
 present, or whose unique identifier has changed for some reason. It is
 important to make sure that the installed GRUB core image stays in sync
 with GRUB modules and grub.cfg. Please check again to make sure that GRUB
 is written to the appropriate boot devices.

 Do you want to continue anyway? If you do, your computer may not start up
 properly.

_Description: Writing GRUB to boot device failed - try again?
 GRUB failed to install to the following devices:
 .
 ${FAILED_DEVICES}
 .
 You may be able to install GRUB to some other device, although you should
 check that your system will boot from that device. Otherwise, the upgrade
 from GRUB Legacy will be canceled.

Template: grub-pc/install_devices_empty
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Continue without installing GRUB?
 You chose not to install GRUB to any devices. If you continue, the boot
 loader may not be properly configured, and when this computer next starts
 up it will use whatever was previously in the boot sector. If there is an
 earlier version of GRUB 2 in the boot sector, it may be unable to load
 modules or handle the current configuration file.
 .
 If you are already using a different boot loader and want to carry on
 doing so, or if this is a special environment where you do not need a boot
 loader, then you should continue anyway. Otherwise, you should install
 GRUB somewhere.

_Description: Remove GRUB 2 from /boot/grub?
 Do you want to have all GRUB 2 files removed from /boot/grub?

 This will make the system unbootable unless another boot loader is
 installed.

_Description: Finish conversion to GRUB 2 now?
 This system still has files from the GRUB Legacy boot loader installed, but
 it now also has GRUB 2 boot records installed on these disks:
 .
 ${DISKS}
 .
 It seems likely that GRUB Legacy is no longer in use, and that you should
 instead upgrade the GRUB 2 images on these disks and finish the conversion
 to GRUB 2 by removing old GRUB Legacy files. If you do not upgrade these
 GRUB 2 images, then they may be incompatible with the new packages and
 cause your system to stop booting properly.
 .
 You should generally finish the conversion to GRUB 2 unless these boot
 records were created by a GRUB 2 installation on some other operating
 system.
