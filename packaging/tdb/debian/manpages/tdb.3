.SH NAME
tdb - trivial database
.SH SYNOPSIS
A database similar to gdbm which allows multiple simultaneous writers.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple database API. It was inspired by the realisation that
in Samba we have several ad-hoc bits of code that essentially
implement small databases for sharing structures between parts of
Samba. As I was about to add another I realised that a generic
database module was called for to replace all the ad-hoc bits.
.sp
I based the interface on gdbm. I couldn't use gdbm as we need to be
able to have multiple writers to the databases at one time.
