Description: BitTorrent Client written in C++
 This application is written in the C++ language and doesn't
 require any graphical component, such as an X server. Original
 ctorrent's upstream has stopped its development and now it's kept 
 updated with new releases/bug fixes by a new developer.
 It's built as a console program and it can be even used remotely
 in a machine that provides outside ssh access. Other main features are:
 .
  * Support for large files (>2GB) and large torrents (>255 files).
  * Strategic selection of pieces to request for download.
  * Continuous queueing of download requests, tuned based on 
    latency and throughput for each peer.
  * Improved download performance, including parallel requests
    in initial and endgame modes.
  * Improved bandwidth regulation.
  * Improved compatibility with other peers.
  * Performance optimization and bug fixes.
  * An interface for monitoring and managing multiple clients.
  * Dynamic cache allocation and management, including prefetch.
 .
