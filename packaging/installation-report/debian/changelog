  * /proc/bus/usb/devices will no longer be available with kernel 2.6.31 due
    to the obsoletion of usbfs, so use different sources for listing USB
    devices in the hardware-summary.
    For the udeb a new script is added that walks sysfs to print the most
    relevant issues; when run on an installed system several alternatives are
    tried in sequence.
  * Move apt-install of installation-report to pre-pkgsel.d, but install with
    --no-recommends to avoid marking reportbug as 'automatically installed'.

    - Don't include dpkg's status file in installation reports as this takes
      up relatively much space and is used only rarely. Also, the syslog now
      lists which udebs are actually installed by anna, including versions.
    - Drop support for the obsolete /var/log/debian-installer dir.

installation-report (2.14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Due to scheduling/fjp-sanity issues, d-i beta2 is going to be releasing
    with version 2.12 of save-logs, so log file permissions will be wrong. At
    some point (soon) a later version of installation-report will reach
    testing and on upgrade fix installs made before that point, but then
    installs made afterwards will not run installation-report's postinst at
    the right time to receive the fix. Work around this problem by installing
    an init script that fixes the log file permissions on boot. Note that
    this init script is scheduled for removal once beta2 is obsolete.

  * Colin Watson
    - Remove dead (since r12587) copy_cdebconf_db code.
  * Joey Hess
    - Stop using package-versions in postinst too (just copy status file),
      and remove the script.
    - Remove some hardcoded /bin paths.
    - Depend on the new mountfloppy udeb, and use the mountfloppy command
      to get the floppy mounted. This means it can prompt for a floppy device
      if it doesn't find the floppy, and so there is usb floppy support,
      assuming the usb mass storage modules have been loaded by hw-detect
      or the boot floppy. Closes: #220306, #221575
    - Remove udeb extended description.
    - Minor indentation cleanups.
    - Reword the message if floppy mount fails.
    - Add "httpd", a very simple http server, and add a menu that can be used
      to start it.
    - Add support for saving debug logs to a mounted filesystem. If /hd-media
      is already mounted, offer it as the default to support USB keys,
      otherwise the user must mount the filesystem by hand. Closes: #267219
    - Use an error template for failed floppy mount.
    - Take down the progress bar if saving a log failed.
    - Save log files to an "install" subdir of the floppy or filesystem;
      if "install" exists go on to "install.2", etc.
    - Cut down on the hardcoded paths to commands.
    - Remove the hdparm stuff that has never really worked, and that 
      is dependent on kernels compiled with devfs.
    - Make report-hw work on regular Debian as well as on d-i, various
      improvements.
    - Add cardctl ident and status to report-hw.
    - Include /proc/bus/usb/devices in report-hw.
    - Add uname -a and free output to report-hw.
    - Add installation-report package, rename bugreporter-udeb to save-logs
      (more accurate), and rename source package to installation-logs.
    - installation-report package has reportbug integration to semi-automate
      a user filing an installation report.
    - Add a man page for report-hw.
    - Add myself to uploaders.
    - Most of the log saving code moved to here from prebaseconfig,
      and the logs moved to /var/log/installer.
    - Reworded and reorganised the installation report template, to
      better prompt the user for info we need. Move hardware info to end,
      and prompt for a log file.
    - Depend on prebaseconfig 1.08.
    - Add /proc/bus/input/devices to report-hw output.
    - If /etc/lsb-release exists in the installer, include it in the log
      files.
