mono (2.10.8.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * [c934e01] Remove unused File::Basename import from runtime script.
    Having this present causes failures on release upgrades where perl-base
    and perl-modules are not in a consistent state (e.g. this can happen
    when upgrading across major Perl versions). (Closes: #665335) (LP:
    #948848)
  * [9e3cc40] Remove monodoc-base trigger.
    This trigger updated the monodoc search index. It ended up calling
    /usr/bin/monodoc, which is shipped in the monodoc-browser package
    (source package mono-tools). The script attempted to check that
    monodoc-browser was configured, but didn't get this right. This led to
    numerous upgrade failures when Depends of monodoc-browser were not
    satisfied when the trigger was invoked and calling monodoc to update the
    search index bombed out due to this. It's more correct to just have
    monodoc-browser ship this trigger itself. (LP: #972751)
  * [dd2925c] Standards-Version bump to 3.9.3, no changes required
  * [8299ee0] Remove duplicate Depends in mono-complete

    changes made to 55a1a20a4d858346ed8a8d840abc3f9230ea816e.
    This branch introduced regressions which caused both nant and mono-upnp
    (at least) to FTBFS. (Closes: #666623)
  * [61fbbe4] Fix ARM printf format problems.
    When building with -Werror=format-security on ARM, mono fails to build
    due to incorrect format strings in arm-dis.c

    Ensures hardening support is enabled for this binary.
    Thanks to Simon Ruderich <simon@ruderich.org> (Closes: #657518)
  * [4bb0138] Ensure compiler flags are passed into build system.
    This issue was discovered when it was noted that Debian's hardening
    buildflags weren't being propogated to all binaries.
