libsemanage (2.0.25-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * [bab6644]: Also check for the uppoer bound on user ids in login.defs

    Some non-Debian packages (like qmail, shudder) create
    users not below MIN_UID, but above MAX_UID, in /etc/login.defs
    (non-system users are supposed to have uids between MIN_UID and
    MAX_UID.

    genhomedircon.c:gethomedirs() checks pwent.pw_uid against MIN_UID in
    /etc/login.defs to exclude system users from generating homedir
    contexts. But unfortunately it does not check it against MAX_UID
    setting from the same file. This gets us lines like the following in
    the contexts/files/file_contexts.homedirs file:
    ,----
    | #
    | # Home Context for user user_u

    * Updated default location for setfiles to /sbin to
      match policycoreutils.  This can also be adjusted via
      semanage.conf using the syntax:

  * Bug fix: "python2.4-semanage: Cannot be installed. Conflicting file
    with libsemanage-dev", thanks to Tomasz Rybak         (Closes: #348050).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Jan 2006 13:49:56 -0600

libsemanage (1.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split out python2.4-semanage into a separate package, since the python
    bindings should not be in a -dev package.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Jan 2006 09:19:05 -0600

libsemanage (1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix dependencies to facilitate backports.

libsemanage (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    * Updated version for release.
    * Changed semanage_handle_create() to set do_reload based on
      is_selinux_enabled().  This prevents improper attempts to
      load policy on a non-SELinux system.
    * Dropped handle from user_del_role interface.
    * Removed defrole interfaces.
    * Merged Makefile python definitions patch from Dan Walsh.
    * Removed is_selinux_mls_enabled() conditionals in seusers and users
      file parsers.
    * Merged wrap char*** for user_get_roles patch from Joshua Brindle.
    * Merged remove defrole from sepol patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged swig wrappers for modifying users and seusers from Joshua Brindle.
    * Fixed free->key_free bug.
    * Merged clear obsolete patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged modified swigify patch from Dan Walsh
      (original patch from Joshua Brindle).
    * Merged move genhomedircon call patch from Chad Sellers.
    * Merged move seuser validation patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged hidden declaration fixes from Ivan Gyurdiev,
      with minor corrections.
    * Merged cleanup patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
      This renames semanage_module_conn to semanage_direct_handle,
      and moves sepol handle create/destroy into semanage handle
      create/destroy to allow use even when disconnected (for the
      record interfaces).
    * Clear modules modified flag upon disconnect and commit.
    * Added tracking of module modifications and use it to
      determine whether expand-time checks should be applied
      on commit.
    * Reverted semanage_set_reload_bools() interface.
    * Disabled calls to port dbase for merge and commit and stubbed
      out calls to sepol_port interfaces since they are not exported.
    * Merged rename instead of copy patch from Joshua Brindle (Tresys).
    * Added hidden_def/hidden_proto for exported symbols used within
      libsemanage to eliminate relocations.  Wrapped type definitions
      in exported headers as needed to avoid conflicts.  Added
      src/context_internal.h and src/iface_internal.h.
    * Added semanage_is_managed() interface to allow detection of whether
      the policy is managed via libsemanage.  This enables proper handling
      in setsebool for non-managed systems.
    * Merged semanage_set_reload_bools() interface from Ivan Gyurdiev,
      to enable runtime control over preserving active boolean values
      versus reloading their saved settings upon commit.
    * Merged seuser parser resync, dbase tracking and cleanup, strtol
      bug, copyright, and assert space patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Added src/*_internal.h in preparation for other changes.
    * Added hidden/hidden_proto/hidden_def to src/debug.[hc] and
      src/seusers.[hc].
    * Merged interface parse/print, context_to_string interface change,
      move assert_noeof, and order preserving patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Added src/dso.h in preparation for other changes.
    * Merged install seusers, handle/error messages, MLS parsing,
      and seusers validation patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged record interface, dbase flush, common database code,
      and record bugfix patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged dbase policydb list and count change from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged enable dbase and set relay patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged query APIs and dbase_file_set patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged sepol handle passing, seusers support, and policydb cache
      patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged resync to sepol changes and booleans fixes/improvements
      patches from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged support for genhomedircon/homedir template, store selection,
      explicit policy reload, and semanage.conf relocation from Joshua
      Brindle.
    * Merged resync to sepol changes and transaction fix patches from
      Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged reorganize users patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged remove unused relay functions patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Fixed policy file leaks in semanage_load_module and

    * Fixed bug in semanage_direct_disconnect.
    * Merged interface renaming patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged policy component patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Renamed 'check=' configuration value to 'expand-check=' for
      clarity.
    * Changed semanage_commit_sandbox to check for and report errors
      on rename(2) calls performed during rollback.
    * Added optional check= configuration value to semanage.conf
      and updated call to sepol_expand_module to pass its value
      to control assertion and hierarchy checking on module expansion.
    * Merged fixes for make DESTDIR= builds from Joshua Brindle.
    * Merged default database from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged removal of connect requirement in policydb backend from
      Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged commit locking fix and lock rename from Joshua Brindle.
    * Merged transaction rollback in lock patch from Joshua Brindle.
    * Changed default args for load_policy to be null, as it no longer
      takes a pathname argument and we want to preserve booleans.
    * Merged move local dbase initialization patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged acquire/release read lock in databases patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged rename direct -> policydb as appropriate patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Added calls to sepol_policy_file_set_handle interface prior
      to invoking sepol operations on policy files.
    * Updated call to sepol_policydb_from_image to pass the handle.
    * Merged user and port APIs - policy database patch from Ivan
      Gyurdiev.
    * Converted calls to sepol link_packages and expand_module interfaces
      from using buffers to using sepol handles for error reporting, and
      changed direct_connect/disconnect to create/destroy sepol handles.
    * Merged bugfix patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged seuser database patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
      Merged direct user/port databases to the handle from Ivan Gyurdiev.

      Merged seuser record patch from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged boolean and interface databases from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Updated to use get interfaces for hidden sepol_module_package type.
    * Changed semanage_expand_sandbox and semanage_install_active
      to generate/install the latest policy version supported	by libsepol
      by default (unless overridden by semanage.conf), since libselinux
      will now downgrade automatically for load_policy.
    * Merged new callback-based error reporting system and ongoing
      database work from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Fixed semanage_install_active() to use the same logic for
      selecting a policy version as semanage_expand_sandbox().  Dropped
      dead code from semanage_install_sandbox().
    * Updated for changes to libsepol, and to only use types and interfaces
      provided by the shared libsepol.
    * Merged further database work from Ivan Gyurdiev.
    * Merged iterate, redistribute, and dbase split patches from
      Ivan Gyurdiev.
