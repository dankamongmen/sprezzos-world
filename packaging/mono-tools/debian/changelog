mono-tools (2.10-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * [f5fdaf0] Ignore failures in the postinst trigger. It's difficult to
    guarantee what's going to be available when the trigger is run. We might
    as well not fail if running any of the commands fails, since that's no
    worse than not registering the packages.
  * [8817190] Call gac-install instead of gac-package-install to install mono
    gac-package-install is for installing /packages/ into the GAC.
    gac-install is for initialising the gac itself. It wasn't right to call
    gac-package-install here. Also, check that required files exist before
    proceeding. (Closes: #681320)

mono-tools (2.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * [62da47c] Move update-monodoc trigger from monodoc-base (in mono)
    The commands being executed from the trigger are in monodoc-browser, so
    it makes sense for the trigger to be here too, then we don't have have
    base attempt to check if -browser is configured, which we could never
    get right.
    We need to have Replaces: and Breaks: monodoc-base (<< 2.10.8.1-3) for
    the moved update-monodoc. -3 is the version which will stop shipping
    update-monodoc; we need to make sure that users don't have this on their
    system after the trigger has moved. (LP: #972751)

      - debhelper bumped to (>= 7)
    + fixed spurious dot in long description
    + New binary packages:
      - mono-profiler, since these two related programs would have gone
                       into two different packages, and this is not nice
                       at all;
      - gendarme, because it would've been split into mono-tools-devel and
                  mono-tools-gui, like mono-profiler; because it uses 
                  System.Windows.Forms.
