Description: library to read, create, and modify mp4 files (shared library)
 The MP4v2 library provides an API to create and modify mp4 files as
 defined by ISO-IEC:14496-1:2001 MPEG-4 Systems. This file format is
 derived from Apple's QuickTime file format that has been used as a
 multimedia file format in a variety of platforms and applications. It is
 a very powerful and extensible format that can accommodate practically
 any type of media.
 .
 MP4v2 was originally bundled with mpeg4ip library, but has been moved
 into its own maintained library due to a combination of the cessation of
 support of mpeg4ip and the usefulness of this library on its own.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
