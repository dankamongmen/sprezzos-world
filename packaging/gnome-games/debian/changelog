gnome-games (2.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * upstream Ross Burton requested to use 2.0.6 or 2.1.3
    of gnome-games
    Because of my upload failure (2.1.0-1) I will stay
    on gnome-games 2.1.x because in just 2 month Gnome 2.2
    will be released (see
    http://developer.gnome.org/dotplan/schedule/ ) and
    gnome-games doesn't use anything from the new 2.1 API
    and works without any problems on 2.0 which is in sid.
    Because I think sarge will not be out quite soon
    (gcc transition didn't started afaik), Gnome 2.2 will
    go into sarge imho.
    Sorry for my mistake uploading 2.1 but this will be fixed
    with 2.2.

    version.
