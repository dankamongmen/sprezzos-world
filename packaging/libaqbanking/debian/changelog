  * Repackage source tarball to get rid of non-free binary in the pristine
    .orig.tar.gz (closes: #469131). See new file debian/README.Debian-source
    for further details.
  * Add patch 01_drop_aqyellownet_for_dfsg which changes the build system to
    build without directories removed for DFSG compliance.
  * Add script debian/make-dfsg-free-source.sh useful for easy repackaging of
    future upstream versions.
  * debian/control:
    - add version requested by ./configure to build dep on Gwenhywfar
    - add dpatch to build dependencies needed for the patch mentioned above
  * debian/rules:
    - include CDBS rules for dpatch
    - touch aclocal.m4, Makefile.in and configure in post-patches:: hook to
      avoid autotools invocation after patching the build system
    - add check for absence of aqyellownet to ensure a DFSG source tarball in
      clean:: hook.
    - remove sed invocation on Doxyfile introduced in 3.0.1-2
      (the resulting change is included upstream)
  * update doc-base file for libaqbanking-doc to be consistent with current
    doc-base sections (thanks to lintian).

libaqbanking (3.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Sun, 10 Feb 2008 16:36:10 +0100

libaqbanking (3.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - now entirely free of libofx artefacts -> remove build-dep on libofx-dev.
    - bumps soname, thus rename package libaqhbci12 -> libaqhbci13

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Tue,  5 Feb 2008 22:56:09 +0100

libaqbanking (3.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - AqBanking has now its own implementation of OFX, but unfortunately the
      file src/plugins/backends/aqofxconnect/plugin/provider.c does still
      #include <libofx/libofx.h>. Thus keep build-dep on libofx-dev until
      upstream fixed that.
  * Vcs-Svn: Switch to raw svn:// url (without ssh). For general read access
    you don't need ssh based authentication.

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Fri, 25 Jan 2008 19:41:41 +0100

libaqbanking (3.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adapt Vcs-{Svn,Browser} fields to new SVN urls (experimental -> trunk)
  * Re-introduce debian/watch file adapted to new download location
  * Add postinst script for package libaqbanking-data replacing empty
    directory /usr/share/aqhbci/xml by symlink to new location of hbci.xml on
    upgrades (closes: #458450). The directory is a possible remainder of
    AqBanking 2.x, which dpkg cannot replace automatically.

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Tue,  1 Jan 2008 15:02:39 +0100

libaqbanking (3.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to Debian unstable
  * Complete instructions for key file updates

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Sun, 30 Dec 2007 16:56:44 +0100

libaqbanking (3.0.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * bump standards version from 3.7.2 to 3.7.3 (no changes needed)
  * Make use of the new Homepage field and drop the pseudo fields.
  * Add a NEWS file giving users a hint about the moved configuration files
    and describing the steps making the old configuration files working again.
  * Add file README.keyfile-update to package aqbanking-tools, preliminaryly
    pointing to the information needed for updating key files.
  * debian/control:
    - add transitional package aqbanking-tool depending on aqbanking-tools
      making upgrades as smooth as possible (closes: #455261)
    - let package aqbanking-tools suggest package gwenhywfar-tools because
      README.keyfile-update refers to it
    - add Vcs-{Svn,Browser} fields
    - add Georg W. Leonhardt to Uploaders.
  * debian/rules:
    - clean up the clean target
    - disable doxygen's generation of mostly empty subdirs in apidoc.
  * Upstream moved downloads to a new place which isn't watch-able yet, thus
    drop the debian/watch file.
  * Delete spurious whitespace in debian/libaqbanking-doc.doc-base which would
    cause a part of the description to be unintentionally displayed verbatim
    (thanks to the lintian authors)

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Sat, 29 Dec 2007 14:07:30 +0100

libaqbanking (3.0.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Remove files SICHERHEITSHINWEISE and README from aqbanking-tools docs
    (deleted upstream).

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Wed, 28 Nov 2007 10:25:12 +0100

libaqbanking (3.0.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Make package libaqbanking-data usable by AqBanking 2 too:
    - install symlink to old path of hbci.xml
    - install missing config files from AqBanking 2 at old places
  * Split plugins linked against Qt or X libraries into separate plugin
    package libaqbanking20-plugins-qt

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Tue, 27 Nov 2007 13:05:22 +0100

libaqbanking (3.0.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This is a rewrite making use of the new Gwenhywfar
    library, switching from OpenSSL to GnuTLS and Gcrypt (closes: #340564).
    This finally allows AqBanking to stop linking against OpenSSL (finally
    closes: #372183).
  * debian/rules: ./configure with backends aqofxconnect (this introduces
    package libaqofxconnect4 and closes: #396305), aqnone and aqhbci and
    frontend qbanking. The other backends/frontends aren't working yet.
  * move all files in /usr/lib/aqbanking/plugins/ (previously cluttered around
    in diverse library packages) into new common plugin package
    libaqbanking20-plugins.
  * debian/control:
    - adapt build dependencies and build depend on libgwenhywfar >= 3.0.0-2~,
      which is the first version shipping without troublesome libgwenhywfar.la
    - drop packages for backends/frontends not being built any more
    - drop package aqbanking16-qt-wizard and move its content into the new
      package libaqbanking20-plugins
    - rename library packages due to bumped sonames
    - clean up old conflicting deps with packages available prior to Etch.
    - merge package libaqnone0 into package libaqbanking20. Upstream promised
      to keep their sonames in sync now.
    - Allow uploads by Debian Maintainers of this package.
  * rename package aqbanking-tool to aqbanking-tools because users might want
    to install the old aqbanking-tool, which contains the binary
    aqbanking-tool, which is missing in the current upstream release.
    Fortunately aqbanking-tool and aqbanking-tools have no files in common,
    thus no conflicting/replacing dependencies.
  * delete debian/TODO (all done)

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Sat, 24 Nov 2007 13:48:31 +0100

libaqbanking (2.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Drop build-dependency to libofx-dev until we re-introduce OFX support.

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Sun, 21 Oct 2007 16:39:46 +0200

libaqbanking (2.3.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * package libaqhbci10 now recommends libchipcard3-libgwenhywfar-plugins.
    This has been missed since 2.2.9-1.

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Fri, 27 Jul 2007 20:23:08 +0200

libaqbanking (2.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/control: make package binNMU safe by using ${source:Version}
    instead of ${Source-Version}

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Fri, 27 Jul 2007 17:57:44 +0200

libaqbanking (2.2.9-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This is the first (packaged) release using
    libchipcard3 instead of libchipcard2.
  * Change build-dep to libchipcard3-dev
  * Bump build-dep version on libgwenhywfar38-dev >= 2.5.4-2. That one removes
    OpenSSL from its broken libgwenhywfar.la which allows us to build a
    libaqbanking not linked against OpenSSL (closes: #372183).

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Tue, 27 Mar 2007 07:12:04 +0200

libaqbanking (2.2.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Let aqbanking-tool depend on libaqnone0 (closes: #401942). 

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Fri,  8 Dec 2006 15:40:56 +0100

libaqbanking (2.2.3-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * libaqhbci10, libaqdtaus3 and libaqgeldkarte4 now conflicts with/replaces
    libqbanking4 younger than 2.2.3-2 (closes: #393706). This should fix the
    upgrade path broken by files moved from libqbanking4 into the plugin
    packages. Fixing broken dependencies is important if not RC, thus I'm
    uploading with higher urgency.

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Wed, 18 Oct 2006 15:32:04 +0200

libaqbanking (2.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add *.so for plugins. This is important if not RC,
    thus I'm uploading with elevated urgency.

libaqbanking (2.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=normal

  * New upstream release
    - account creation wizard works now with NetBank and Sparda.
  * libaqbanking16 does not anymore depend on the plugin package, but yet
    recommends it.
  * libaqbanking16-plugins-libgwenhywfar38 has now depends generated as usual
    by dpkg-shlibdeps. This should fix a checklib error in the plugin package.
  * Make libaqbanking16-dev binNMU safe.

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Wed, 11 Oct 2006 21:04:05 +0000

libaqbanking (2.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename package aqbanking-qt-wizard to aqbanking16-qt-wizard because the
    contained binaries are located in a SONAME dependent path.
  * libaqbanking16 now recommends (not only suggests) aqbanking-qt-wizard.
  * Move qbanking's cfgmodule plugins into the corresponding backend packages.
    Upstream said they are useless without installed backend.

 -- Micha Lenk <micha@lenk.info>  Tue,  5 Sep 2006 18:13:14 +0200

libaqbanking (2.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduce package libaqnone0 (Closes: #381165).

    libaqbanking16 (closes #373912, first part)
  * Move aqhbci-qt3-debug from package libaqhbci10 to aqbanking-qt-wizard
    (Closes: #373912, second part)
  * Move openhbci1 import module from package libaqhbci10 to package
    libaqbanking16. It does not at all depend on AqHBCI.
  * Bump shlibs.
  * Simplfied debian/*.install files.

  * Dropped unneeded build-depends. No more build-depending on: libqt3-mt-dev,
    libgail-common, xvfb, xbase-clients, xfonts-base and fakeroot.
    Closes: #370455
  * Use gcc in order to benefit from symbol visibility features of gcc
  * Add AqNone backend to package libaqbanking16 (left out by mistake)
  * Move documentation and register it with doc-base.
  * With this rebuild, the transient dependency problems should be fixed.
    Closes: #372933
