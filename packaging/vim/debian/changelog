      + Disable spell checking for verbatim sections.  (Closes: #445295)
    - netrwPlugin.vim-bwipe.diff:

      + This patch was initially added to silence a GLib warning (#428854)
        which isn't occurring anymore.
  * Stop removing vimspell, vim132, and maze from the runtime tools/
    directory.  The issues leading to their removal should be addressed
    instead of removing them from the package.
    - vimspell - The tempfile vulnerability (CAN-2005-0069) has been fixed
      upstream for some time now.
    - vim132 - Add lintian overrides for "csh is harmful" and not having a
      Depends/Recommends/Suggests on tcsh | csh.  This is the only file in the
      package that would use the shell and its an example script.
    - maze - maze.c doesn't work properly and its README suggests this may be
      the case on newer compilers and to use mazeansi.c, which does work.

  * Add verilog.vim_ftplugin-cpoptions.diff, which locally enables line
    continuations for the ftplugin in order to prevent an error when being run
    in vi-compatible mode.  (Closes: #430372)
  * Build vim with the huge feature set to pull in +profile (the only
    difference between the big and huge feature sets).
  * Remove the !hurd-i386 restriction from the tcl8.4-dev Build-Depends now
    that the package exists on hurd-i386.  This allows building the vim-tcl
    package for hurd-i386.  (Closes: #434435)
  * Remove the hacks we were doing to try and build vim-tiny with extra
    features.  Simply build vim-tiny using Vim's "small" feature set.  This
    removes a number of features but allows the package to build with the
    current upstream patches.  This also lessens the maintenance burden since
    we no longer have to figure out which features to enable via trial and
    error.
  * debian/rules:
    - Separate out {clean,configure,build}-stamp-vim-tiny targets
    - Move the handling of the vimrc.tiny patch to the new *-vim-tiny targets.
    - Remove configure-stamp* files in the clean target.
    - Move the fake help files for vim-tiny from /usr/share/vim/doc to
      /usr/share/vim/$VIMCUR so the user can actually see them when invoking
      :help.
  * Add ruby.vim_indent.diff, which fixes some improper indenting for Ruby
    files.  (Closes: #431212)
  * Refresh vimrc.tiny.diff
  * Add index.txt.diff, which adds some missing cross-references to the index
    of Vim commands.  (Closes: #434447)
  * debian/control:
    - Remove Conflicts/Replaces on packages that are older than Etch.
    - Add a Replaces to vim-runtime since it ships files that overwrite files
      in vim-tiny.
    - Add a Conflicts to vim-tiny for earlier versions of vim-runtime to make
      sure we don't attempt to overwrite files in versions of vim-runtime that
      don't Replace vim-tiny.

    were uselessly setting 'textwidth' to the default value and 'viminfo' to
    an almost-default but less useful value.
  * Add Makefile_no-strip.diff, which removes the calls to strip in upstream's

    debian/vim-common.postinst as they all handled special procedures for

      not provide a GUI version of Vim.
  * debian/rules
    - Update the extract and clean targets to not fail if quilt exits with
      $? == 2.  Also, remove the .pc directory in the clean target.
    - Remove preinst from the list of per-variant files
  * Add spell.c_getc-eof.diff, which causes Vim to stop reading a truncated
    spellfile when it reaches EOF.
  * debian/runtime/debian.vim.in
    - set 'nomodeline' by default since modelines have historically been a
      source of security/resource vulnerabilities.  Users should have to
      explicitly enable the option to assume the associated risks.
  * Add gui_gtk_x11.c_g_thread_init.diff, which prevents a glib warning
    related to glib 2.10's Memory Slices and threads.  (Closes: #428854)

    old unenforced one
  * debian/runtime/debian.vim.in

      previous substitute string.
    + 6.0.125: Win32: When using the multi_byte_ime feature pressing the
      shift key would be handled as if a character was entered, thus

      mode, ":amenu" commands didn't work in Insert mode. Menu language

    + 6.0.146: When 'statusline' contains "%{'-'}" this results in a zero.
    + 6.0.147: It's not easy to mark a Vim version as being modified. The
      new license requires this.
    + 6.0.148: After "p" in an empty line, `[ goes to the second character.
