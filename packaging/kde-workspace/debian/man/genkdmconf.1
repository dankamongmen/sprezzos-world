.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgenkdmconf\fP is used to generate configuration files for \fBkdm\fP.
.br
If an older xdm/kdm configuration is found, its config files are "absorbed";
if it lives in the new target directory, its scripts are reused (and possibly
modified) as well, otherwise the scripts are ignored and default scripts are
installed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-\-in \ /path/to/new/kdm\-config\-dir
In which directory to put the new configuration. You can use this to support a $(DESTDIR), but not to change the final location of the installation \- the paths inside the files are not affected.
.br
Default is \fI/etc/kde4/kdm\fP.
.TP
.BI \-\-old\-xdm \ /path/to/old/xdm\-dir
Where to look for the config files of an \fBxdm\fP / older \fBkdm\fP. Default is to scan
.IR /etc/X11/kdm , \ $XLIBDIR/kdm , \ /etc/X11/xdm , \ $XLIBDIR/xdm ;
there in turn look for \fIkdm\-config\fP and \fIxdm\-config\fP.
.br
Note that you possibly need to use \fB\-\-no\-old\-kde\fP to make this take effect.
.TP
.BI \-\-old\-kde \ /path/to/old/kde\-config\-dir
Where to look for the \fIkdmrc\fP of an older \fBkdm\fP.
.br
.RI Default\ is\ to\ scan\  /etc/kde4 \ and\ { /usr,/usr/local ,
.RI { /opt,/usr/local }{ kde3,kde,kde2,kde1 }} /share/config .
.TP
.B \-\-no\-old
Don't look at older xdm/kdm configurations, just create default config.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-old\-xdm
Don't look at older xdm configurations.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-old\-kde
Don't look at older kdm configurations.
.TP
.B \-\-old\-scripts
Directly use all scripts from the older xdm/kdm configuration.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-old\-scripts
Don't use scripts from the older xdm/kdm configuration even if it lives in the new target directory.
.TP
.B \-\-old\-confs
Directly use all ancillary config files from the older xdm/kdm configuration. This is usually a bad idea.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-backup
Overwrite/delete old config files instead of backing them up.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-in\-notice
Don't put the notice about \fB\-\-in\fP being used into the generated README.
