Description: Advanced version control system
 Apache Subversion, also known as svn, is a centralised version control
 system.  Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
 distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (source
 code, websites, etc).  Subversion began with a CVS paradigm and
 supports all the major features of CVS, but has evolved to support
 many features that CVS users often wish they had.
 .
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn), repository
 administration tools (svnadmin, svnlook) and a network server (svnserve).

Description: Development files for Apache Subversion libraries
 This package contains the symlinks, headers, and object files needed
 to compile and link programs which use libsvn1, the Apache Subversion
 libraries.  This package is needed only in order to compile software
 that uses libsvn1.

Package: libsvn-doc
Suggests: libsvn-dev
Section: doc
Priority: extra
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Developer documentation for libsvn
 This package contains development (API) documentation for libsvn1, the

Depends: apache2.2-common, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: db5.3-util
Description: Apache Subversion server modules for Apache httpd
 This package provides the mod_dav_svn and mod_authz_svn modules for
 the Apache 2.2 web server.  These modules provide Apache Subversion's WebDAV
 server backend, to serve repositories over the http and https
 protocols.  See the 'subversion' package for more information.

Description: Assorted tools related to Apache Subversion
 This package includes miscellaneous tools for use with Apache Subversion
 clients and servers:
  * svn-backup-dumps: Incremental dumpfile-based backup script
  * svn-bisect: Bisect revisions to find a regression
  * svn-clean: Remove unversioned files from a working copy
  * svn-fast-backup: rsync-based backup script for FSFS repositories
  * svn-hot-backup: Backup script, primarily for BDB repositories
  * svn_apply_autoprops: Apply property settings from
    .subversion/config file to an existing repository
  * svn_load_dirs: Sophisticated replacement for 'svn import'
  * svnwrap: Set umask to 002 before calling svn or svnserve
  * several example hook scripts: commit-access-control, commit-email,
    log-police, mailer, svnperms, verify-po
 .
 NOTE that some of these scripts are unsupported by upstream, and may
 change radically or disappear in future releases.  Some of these
 scripts require packages on the Recommends list.
