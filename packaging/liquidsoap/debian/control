Description: audio streaming language
 Liquidsoap is a powerful tool for building complex audio streaming systems,
 typically targeting internet radios (e.g. icecast streams).
 .
 It consists of a simple script language, in which you can create, combine and
 transform audio sources. Its design makes liquidsoap flexible and easily
 extensible.
 .
 Some of the typical uses are:
  * dynamically generating playlists depending on the time or other factors
  * having smooth transitions between songs
  * adding jingles periodically
  * applying effects on the sound like volume normalization
  * reencoding the stream at various qualities
  * remotely controlling the stream
