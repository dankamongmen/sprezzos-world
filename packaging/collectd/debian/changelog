collectd (5.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - ping plugin: Don't abort if ping_send fails but report an error only;
      thanks to Bernd Zeimetz for reporting this (Closes: #630683).
    - df plugin: Ignore "rootfs" file-system type to make sure that root
      file-system statistics are only collected once; thanks to Florian La
      Roche for reporting this (Closes: #657122).
    - Fixed parse errors when using (including) empty config files; thanks to
      Reinhard Tartler for reporting this (Closes: #592881).
    New plugins:
    - Aggregate multiple values lists into one: aggregation
    - Query statistics from BSD's packet filter: pf (FreeBSD only)
  * Uploading to experimental because of the Wheezy freeze.
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
    - Build-depend on kfreebsd-kernel-headers (kfreebsd-any only) and disable
      the 'pf' plugin on non-kfreebsd systems.
  * debian/patches:
    - Removed migrate-4-5-df.dpatch; merged upstream.
    - Removed rtnl_dump_filter.dpatch; merged upstream.
    - Added myplugin_includes.dpatch -- change the example plugin include path
      to /usr/include/collectd/core/ (see below).
    - rrd_filter_path.dpatch: Also patch the migrate-4-5 script; while this is
      not required for the (optional) auto-migration when updating the package
      (the full path is passed as an argument) it helps the user to just use
      the script without the need to add further arguments; thanks to Joey
      Hess for reporting this (Closes: #689001).
  * debian/rules:
    - Fix installation paths used for Perl bindings. Upstream now passes
      INSTALL_BASE rather than PREFIX to Makefile.PL which resulted in the
      bindings being installed to different locations than before.
  * debian/collectd-utils.install:
    - Install collectd-tg(1).
  * debian/libcollectdclient-dev.install:
    - Install the libcollectdclient network*.h header files.
  * Renamed libcollectclient0 to libcollectdclient1 due to the SONAME version
    bump.
  * debian/libcollectdclient1.symbols:
    - Updated for 5.2.
  * debian/collectd-dev.install:
    - Install the collectd (daemon) headers to /usr/include/collectd/core/
      rather than /usr/include/collectd/. The latter is used by
      libcollectdclient which causes file conflicts.
  * debian/collectd.conf:
    - Let the 'df' plugin ignore 'rootfs' (else, the root file-system would
      appear twice, causing one of the updates to fail and spam the log) and
      the usual virtual / temporary file-systems (cf. #657122).
  * debian/collectd-core.postrm:
    - Source the debconf confmodule to make the db_* functions available;
      thanks to Joey Hess and YunQiang Su for reporting this
      (Closes: #680172, #688285).
  * debian/po:
    - Updated Brazilian Portuguese debconf templates; thanks to Adriano Rafael
      Gomes (Closes: #685760).

  * debian/patches/migrate-4-5-df.dpatch, debian/collectd-core.postinst:
    - Added patch to fix the migration of 'df' values in migrate-4-5.px;
      thanks to 'markuskaindl' for reporting this on IRC.
    - Pass --rrdfilter and --rrdtool parameters to migrate-4-5.px in order to
      let the script find those binaries/scripts.
    (Closes: #681363)
  * debian/collectd-core.collectd.init.d:
    - Catch disabled state in start and restart and don't exit with an error
      status. Amongst others, this fixes an upgrade of collectd when the
      daemon is disabled. Thanks to Florian Ernst for reporting this and
      Evgeni Golov for providing (an early) patch (Closes: #681216).
    - Don't use 'set -e' and 'exit 0' (at the end) in order to let return
      statuses propagate correctly. (cf. #681216)

      (Closes: #678614).
    - Updated Spanish debconf translation; thanks to Omar Campagne
      (Closes: #679281).
  * debian/collectd-core.collectd.init.d:
    - Source /lib/lsb/init-functions in order to make systemd work in
      compatibility mode; thanks to Michael Stapelberg for reporting this
      (Closes: #679544).
    - Use log_* and status_of_proc functions from LSB's init functions to
      make collectd's output look like all the other output; thanks to
      Matthias Urlichs for pointing this out (Closes: #679355).

collectd (4.10.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixed an endless loop in case the datadir is a symlink pointing to a
      non-existent target; thanks to Michael Prokop for reporting this and
      Jonathan Nieder for providing the patch (Closes: #619123).
    - Use bsd/nlist.h rather than the deprecated nlist.h on FreeBSD fixing a
      FTBFS on kfreebsd; thanks to Tobias Frost for reporting this
      (Closes: #664429).
  * debian/patches/:
    - Removed ipvs_h_include.dpatch -- applied upstream.
    - Added rtnl_dump_filter.dpatch, updating the rtnl_dump_filter() signature
      to recent versions of iproute2.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use dpkg-buildflags to determine compiler/linker flags; this also
      enables hardening build flags; thanks to Moritz Muehlenhoff for
      providing the patch (Closes: #656271).
    - Don't force building of the ipvs plugin. The ip_vs.h check has been
      fixed in configure.
    - Use /usr/share/javahelper/java-arch.sh to determine the Java
      architecture directory, thus, making sure armhf and armel are supported
      as well; thanks to peter green for reporting this and providing the
      pointer (Closes: #656274).
    - Work around #673431 (kvm.h requires sys/types.h) by forcing the processes
      plugin on kfreebsd and manually defining HAVE_STRUCT_KINFO_PROC_FREEBSD.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Added section 'Cleanup of old data' explaining how to get rid of
      out-dated data files (e.g. RRD files).

      Millan for reporting this and providing a pointer to the fix
      (Closes: #634690).
    - Explicitly build-depend on libkvm-dev on kfreebsd; this is required by
      the processes, swap and tcpconns plugins.
  * debian/collectd-core.postrm, debian/collectd-core.templates:
    - Prompt the user (debconf priority high) when purging the collected data
      providing an option to opt out. The question defaults to remove the
      data; thanks to Trent W. Buck for reporting and discussing this
      (Closes: #631167).
  * debian/collectd-core.collectd.init.d:
    - Added cpufrequtils to should-start, else collectd does not reliably
      detect all CPUs; thanks to Mathias Bauer for reporting and debugging

collectd (4.10.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Added support for Yajl version 2; thanks to John Stamp for reporting
      this (Closes: #653879).
    - collectd.conf(5) now documents the "Globals" config option and that this
      is required for the "perl" and "python" plugins; thanks to Jeff Green
      for reporting this (Closes: #612784).
    - Be more verbose about why loading a plugin fails; thanks to Martin
      Steigerwald for reporting this (Closes: #585975).
    - Don't abort if including a config file fails; thanks to Reinhard Tartler
      for reporting this (Closes: #592880).

      package.
    - Split 'build' target into 'build-arch' and 'build-indep' as recommended
      by policy.
  * debian/patches/ipvs_h_include, debian/rules:
    - Let the ipvs plugin use linux/ip_vs.h rather than net/ip_vs.h. Also,
      make sure to look for the header in /usr/include rather than the kernel
      directory (which has been deprecated).
    - Force building of the ipvs plugin since configure is not currently able
      to correctly check for ip_vs.h.
  * debian/control:
    - Updated standards-version to 3.9.2 -- no changes.

      (Closes: #569268).
  * debian/collectd-core.overrides:
    - Override 'capitalization-error-in-description python Python' -- all

collectd (4.9.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Re-enabled non-kfreebsd plugins on i386 and amd64, which had been
      disabled accidentally by using findstring (which does a substring match)
      to compare DEB_BUILD_ARCH with kfreebsd-{amd64,i386}; thanks to ilia

    - Replaced all occurrences of 'findstring' with appropriate 'filter'
      statements to make sure to match words rather than substrings.

    - Added bts566199_collection_hide_types.dpatch -- added ability to hide
      specified types in collection.cgi; thanks to Pavel Piatruk for the patch
      (Closes: #566199).

collectd (4.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Now using libtool 2.
  * Set urgency to medium because of the fix for #559801.
  * Split the "collectd" binary package into "collectd-core" and "collectd".
    The former provides the main program file and the plugins while the latter
    provides the configuration. This allows for much more flexible setups
    (e.g. providing customizations on top of "collectd-core" without modifying
    the "collectd" package) and, amongst others, removes the hard dependency
    on librrd (Closes: #495936, #544311).
  * debian/collectd-core.collectd.init.d:
    - Do not (try to) start collectd if the config file does not exist. Else,
      installation of "collectd-core" (which does not provide configuration)
      would fail.
  * debian/collectd.postinst:
    - Let the "collectd" package restart the daemon, since it provides the
      config file.
  * debian/collectd.links:
    - Symlink /u/s/d/collectd/examples to /u/s/d/collectd-core/examples.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on the right combination of libsnmp-dev and perl. Perl's
      CFLAGS (included in net-snmp's CFLAGS) introduced '-fstack-protector' in
      version 5.10.1 on some architectures (those supporting that features).
      net-snmp has been fixed to handle that correctly in 5.4.2.1~dfsg-4;
      thanks to Lamont Jones and Dann Frazier for reporting this
      (Closes: #559087).
    - Build-depend on libsensors4-dev rather than libsensors-dev. libsnmp-dev,
      starting with version 5.4.2.1~dfsg-5, supports libsensors4, thus making
      that possible. This restores the full functionality of the "sensors"
      plugin, which does not work well with libsensors3 and lm-sensors-3;
      thanks to Anssi Kolehmainen for reporting this (Closes: #538795).
    - Build-depend on libltdl-dev to make it possible to use the system-wide
      libltdl.
    - No longer conflict/provide/replace the pre-Lenny "collectd-$plugin"
      packages.
    - Update the list of collectd-core's suggestions: added various services
      providing data that may be collected by collectd. Downgraded lm-sensors
      from a recommendation to a suggestion.
  * debian/patches:
    - Removed gmond-fix-compile-error.dpatch -- included upstream.
    - Added bts561577_collectd2html_recursive_fix.dpatch -- fixed
      collectd2html.pl's recursive mode and improved some defaults; thanks to
      Yuri D'Elia for reporting this and providing a patch (Closes: #561577).
    - Added bts557599_powerdns_fix.dpatch -- fixed communication to pdns
      versions 2.9.22 and above; thanks to <tm@iprog.com> for reporting this
      and Luke Heberling for providing the patch (Closes: #557599).
    - Added bts559801_plugin_find_fix.dpatch -- make collectd resistant
      against copies of libltdl affected by CVE-2009-3736. This fixes a
      potential but very unlikely security issue, e.g. found in the embedded
      copy. For details about how collectd might be affected, see
      <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=559801#15>; thanks to
      Michael Gilbert for reporting this (Closes: #559801).
  * debian/rules:
    - Pass --without-included-ltdl to configure to tell libtool 2 to not use
      the shipped libltdl but rather the one available in the system. Thus,
      in the future, libltdl related issues do no longer require updated
      collectd packages.
    - Pass --disable-static to configure to tell libtool 2 to not build any
      static libraries.
    - Install debian/collectd.conf as an example into "collectd-core".
    - Output the content of config.log if configure fails -- this might help
      debugging.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Added a short explanation of the package split.

collectd (4.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Disabled the "java" plugin on hppa for now to work around a backlog in
      the buildds that currently prevents a transition to testing.
  * debian/control:
    - Do not build-depend on openjdk-6-jdk on hppa.

 -- Sebastian Harl <tokkee@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Nov 2009 10:55:33 +0100

collectd (4.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a build issue with libiptc that caused a segfault in the iptables
      plugin; thanks to Rodrigo Campos for reporting this (Closes: #535786).
    - Updated the powerdns plugin to support pdns 2.9.22 (and above) as well;
      thanks to Thomas Morgan for reporting this and Luke Heberling for
      providing a patch (Closes: #535787).
    New plugins:
    - Parse JSON files: curl_json
    - Query data from Java processes using JMX: GenericJMX (Java based plugin)
    - Atheros wireless LAN chipset statistics: madwifi
    - Optimized Link State Routing daemon statistics: olsrd
    - Tokyo Tyrant server statistics: tokyotyrant (disabled in Debian,
      libtokyotyrant is not available)
    - Send collected values to a web-server: write_http
    - ZFS Adaptive Replacement Cache statistics: zfs_arc (disabled in Debian,
      libkstat is not available)
    New matches:
    - Match zero COUNTER values: empty_counter
  * Set urgency to medium because of the fix for #535786.
  * debian/rules:
    - Install contrib/GenericJMX.conf to /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/.
    - Disabled the tokyotyrant and zfs_arc plugins - their dependencies are
      not available.
  * debian/patches:
    - Removed bts535787-powerdns-fix-localsocket.dpatch - included upstream.
    - Removed bts541953-curl-followlocation.dpatch - included upstream.
    - Removed bts542859-df-fix-ignorelist.dpatch - included upstream.

      error in the gmond plugin.
  * debian/control:
    - Build depend on libyajl-dev, which is required by the curl_json plugin.
  * Added debian/README.source:
    - The file includes a pointer to /usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source.gz.
  * New debconf template translations:
    - ja.po, thanks to Hideki Yamane (Closes: #550968).

 -- Sebastian Harl <tokkee@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Oct 2009 20:54:46 +0200

collectd (4.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #541887).
    - collectd2html.pl now supports the creation of SVG images; thanks to Ivan
      Shmakov for providing a patch (Closes: #482185).
    New plugins:
    - Connection tracking table size: conntrack
    - Linux file-system based caching framework statistics: fscache
    - Receive and interpret Ganglia multicast traffic: gmond
    - Embedded Java Virtual Machine: java
    - Query and parse data from a memcache daemon: memcachec
    - Information about network protocols: protocols
    - Parse table-like structured files: table
    - Power consumption measurements from "The Energy Detective" (TED): ted
    - System uptime: uptime
  * debian/rules:
    - Install collectd-unixsock.py to /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/.
    - Pass CPPFLAGS and CFLAGS as arguments to configure instead of setting
      them in the environment - this is the recommended way.
    - Pass appropriate JAVAC, JAVA_CPPFLAGS and JAVA_LDFLAGS variables to
      configure, using OpenJDK found in /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk. The
      archdir mapping used by the openjdk-6 Debian package is used to find
      libjvm.so in JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ARCHDIR/server.
    - Use -rpath to tell the "java" plugin where to find libjvm.so.
    - Pass --enable-all-plugins to configure to make sure that the build fails
      if any prerequisites are missing.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on openjdk-6-jdk.
    - Build-depend on libganglia1-dev (>= 3), required by the gmond plugin.
    - Build-depend on libgcrypt11-dev, used by the network plugin.
    - Updated Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes).
    - Changed build-dependency libmysqlclient15-dev to libmysqlclient-dev -
      this allows transitions to be handled thru binNMUs if possible.
  * debian/collectd.install:
    - Install collectd-java.5.
  * debian/patches:
    - Removed libcollectdclient_static_sstrerror.dpatch - included upstream.
    - Added network-fix-cacheflush.dpatch - upstream patch to fix the handling
      of the 'CacheFlush' config option of the "network" plugin.
    - Added libvirt-reconnect.dpatch - upstream patch to let the "libvirt"
      plugin re-connect to libvirtd if connecting fails.
    - Added plugin-fix-unregister.dpatch - upstream patch to make
      'plugin_unregister_read()' functional again, thus fixing a failed
      assertion in some cases.
    - Added java-fix-jvm-start.dpatch - upstream patch to fix the JVM startup.
    - Added bts541953-curl-followlocation.dpatch - upstream patch to let
      plugins using libcurl follow HTTP redirects; thanks to Joey Hess for
      reporting this (Closes: #541953).
    - Added bts535787-powerdns-fix-localsocket.dpatch - upstream patch fixing
      the handling of the 'LocalSocket' config option of the "powerdns"
      plugin; thanks to Thomas Morgan for reporting this and Luke Heberling
      for providing a patch (references: #535787).
    - Added bts542859-df-fix-ignorelist.dpatch - upstream patch to fix the
      handling of the ignorelist in the "df" plugin; thanks to Joey Hess for
      reporting this (Closes: #542859).
  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Removed the note about how to get collectd2html.pl working with
      version 4 of collectd - the script now supports the --recursive option
      which takes care of that.
  * debian/collectd.overrides:
    - Documented the 'binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath' warning - the rpath is
      required by the "java" plugin.
  * New debconf template translations:
    - cs.po, thanks to Martin Sin (Closes: #534206).
    - ru.po, thanks to Yuri Kozlov (Closes: #539467).
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
    - No not limit the "libvirt" plugin to amd64, i386, powerpc - libvirt-dev
      seems to be available on all architectures now.
    - Reintroduced a work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) by
      providing a fixed version of OpenIPMIpthread.pc in debian/pkgconfig and
      adding that path to PKG_CONFIG_PATH. Removed the version from the
      libopenipmi-dev build dependency for now.
  * debian/collectd.conf:
    - Set the "apache" plugin's URL according to the default used by Debian's
      Apache; thanks to Joey Hess for reporting this (Closes: #541888).
  * debian/libcollectdclient-dev.install, debian/rules:
    - Do not install libcollectdclient's .la file in favor of the Squeeze
      release goal to remove those files (for details see
      <http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/08/msg00783.html>).

      not allow to link non-PIC code into shared objects, thanks to Peter De
      Schrijver for reporting this (Closes: #524593).
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on iptables-dev (>= 1.4.3.2-2) to link against the packaged
      libiptc which is available as shared library since iptables 1.4.3.
      Depend on versions >= 1.4.3.2-2 because of #524766.

collectd (4.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixed the use of struct in6_addr (Closes: #521748).
    - Added a filter infrastructure based on "matches" and "targets".
    - Added support for vmem graphs to collection.cgi (Closes: #521993).

    - es.po, thanks to Francisco Javier Cuadrado and Erika Chacón Vivas
      (Closes: #520988).
  * debian/patches:
    - Removed perl-uninitialized-var.dpatch - included upstream.
  * debian/control:
    - Added new binary packages libcollectdclient0 and libcollectdclient-dev
      for the newly added client library.
    - Added new binary package collectd-utils for optional utilities that pull
      in additional dependencies. Currently, this only includes
      collectd-nagios. The new package replaces collectd (<< 4.6.1-1~),
      because it overwrites /usr/bin/collectd-nagios.
    - Added libdbi0-dev to the build dependencies - this is required by the
      dbi plugin.
    - Moved collectd-dbg from section "utils" to the newly added "debug".
    - Updated Standards-Version to 3.8.1.
  * debian/rules:

  * debian/collectd.init.d:
    - Start the daemon using start-stop-daemon's --oknodo option to exit
      successfully if the daemon is already running as requested by section
      9.3.2 of the Debian Policy 3.8.1.
  * debian/copyright:

    New plugins:
    - Count the number of files in directories: filecount
    - Send desktop notifications to a notification daemon: notify_desktop
    - Send notification E-mails: notify_email
    - One-wire sensors information: onewire (experimental, disabled in Debian)
    - PostgreSQL database statistics: postgresql
    - Linux ACPI thermal zone information: thermal (Closes: #492580)
  * Uploading to experimental because of the Lenny freeze.
  * debian/control:
    - Added build dependency on libglib2.0-dev and libnotify-dev required by
      the notify_desktop plugin.
    - Added build dependency on libesmtp-dev required by the notify_email
      plugin.
    - Added build dependency on libpq-dev required by the postgresql plugin.
    - Let collectd-dbg and collectd-dev depend on ${misc:Depends} - this is
      required when using debhelper.
  * debian/rules:
    - Disabled onewire plugin - owfs is not yet available in Debian.
    - Install contrib/snmp-probe-host.px to /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/.
    - Set CONFIGFILE to /etc/collectd/collectd.conf.

collectd (4.4.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the work around for #474087 (broken openipmi .pc files) introduced
    in 4.4.1-1 and instead build depend on libopenipmi-dev (>= 2.0.14-1~)
    which includes fixed .pc files. This fixes an undefined symbol error when
    loading the ipmi plugin caused by that work around (Closes: #494665).
  * debian/collectd.init.d:
    - The "status" command now exits with 1 if collectd is not running.
    - Do not suppress output when checking the configuration with the -t
      command line option. This will also show errors that don't cause
      collectd to abort, e.g. failure to load plugins (Closes: #499232).
  * debian/control:
    - Added librrd-dev as the preferred option to the librrd2-dev build
      dependency - the latter one is a virtual package since rrdtool 1.3.
  * Added debian/patches/perl_deadlock.dpatch - upstream patch to fix a
    possible deadlock in the perl plugin (Closes: #499179).
  * Added debian/patches/memory_libstatgrab.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix a typo in the libstatgrab code of the memory plugin.
  * Added debian/patches/collectd_memleak.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix a possible memory leak.
  * Added debian/patches/snmp_memleak.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to fix a
    possible memory leak in the snmp plugin.
  * Added debian/patches/memcached_fdleak.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix a possible file descriptor leak in the memcached plugin.
  * Added debian/patches/memcached_timeout.dpatch - trivial upstream patch to
    fix the timeout passed to poll(2).

collectd (4.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed librrd0-dev and libmysqlclient14-dev from the build-dependencies -
    those package are no longer available since Etch.
  * Removed byacc from the build-dependencies - collectd now requires bison.
  * Removed libupsclient-config.sh - upstream now supports pkg-config for
    libupsclient.
  * Include collection3 in /usr/share/doc/collectd/examples/:
    - Updated README.Debian to point the collection3's README.
    - Added libconfig-general-perl to the suggested packages.
  * README.Debian: Added a note about how to get collectd2html.pl working with
    version 4 of collectd.
  * Added debian/patches/myplugin_strcpy.dpatch - use sstrncpy() instead of
    strcpy() which is poisoned in collectd.h.
  * collectd.overrides: Removed shlib-with-non-pic-code for nut.so - the
    plugin now links against the shared libupsclient.
  * Do not compress any example files, so they may be used directly.

collectd (4.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restrict libcurl4-gnutls-dev build dependency to versions which are not
    affected by #488701 (Closes: #489091).
  * Added linux-libc-dev (<< 2.6.25-1) as an option to the linux-libc-dev
    (>= 2.6.25-4) build dependency - those versions are not affected by
    #479899.
  * Added build dependency on pkg-config - this is used by collectd's
    configure script to check for a couple of libraries.
  * Added libupsclient-config.sh to imitate libupsclient-config which is no
    longer available. libupsclient-config.sh is a simple wrapper around
    pkg-config. This is a workaround until upstream supports pkg-config for
    libupsclient.
  * Replaced nut-dev build dependency with libupsclient1-dev:
    Reenabled the "nut" plugin on all architectures.
