This package was initially debianised by Ian Lynagh <igloo@debian.org> on
Thu, 08 Nov 2007. All of the Debian packaging scripts are released into
the public domain.

Further packaging by Erik de Castro Lopo <erikd@mega-nerd.com> on 12 July 2009,
which added libghc6-hscolour-(dev|doc|prof) binary packages. The *-doc package
was rather tricky as explained in the debian/rules file. This packaging stuff
is also released into the public domain.
