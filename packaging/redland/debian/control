Description: Redland Resource Description Framework (RDF) library
 Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface for RDF
 (Resource Description Framework) implemented in an object-based API.
 It is modular and supports different RDF/XML parsers, storage
 mechanisms and other elements. Redland is designed for applications
 developers to provide RDF support in their applications as well as
 for RDF developers to experiment with the technology.
 .
 This package includes the core file-based storages.  To get database
 backed storages, the librdf-storage-postgresql, librdf-storage-mysql
 or librdf-storage-sqlite packages should be installed.
