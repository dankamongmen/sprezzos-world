erlang (1:15.b.3-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (upload to experimental because of freeze).
  * Removed debian/patches/m68k.patch which doesn't work anymore anyway.
  * Created a separate manpage for to_erl(1) by copying the relevant info
    from /usr/share/doc/erlang-doc/doc/embedded/embedded_solaris.html.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 08 Jan 2013 13:11:35 +0400

erlang (1:15.b.2-dfsg-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added link for to_erl communication program to /usr/bin. Also linked its
    manpage to run_erl.1 because there's no direct documentation on to_erl and
    it's intended to use in cooperation with run_erl.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Oct 2012 13:04:16 +0400

erlang (1:15.b.2-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

erlang (1:15.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved kernel and stdlib include files from erlang-dev to the erlang-base
    and erlang-base-hipe packages, and snmp include to erlang-snmp because
    they are needed to run escripts. This makes two recommended dependencies
    on erlang-dev unnecesary.
  * Moved sources of the erl_docgen application to the erlang-src package.
  * Switched to xz compression of binary packages to save mirror disk space
    and network bandwidth.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sat, 02 Jun 2012 01:02:17 +0400

    flavor. This helps to use M-x describe-function for erlang mode in Emacs
    (closes: #670345).
  * Removed stale symlink to /usr/lib/erlang/usr/include/driver.h.
  * Fixed a few errors in manpages and added missing whatis entries.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Thu, 31 May 2012 16:13:21 +0400

  * New upstream release.
  * Added new package erlang-eldap with Erlang LDAP library.
  * Added eldap application license to debian/copyright.
  * Use (debian-pkg-add-load-path-item <path>) instead of manipulating

  * Included all HiPE application sources into erlang-src package
    (closes: #653417).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jan 2012 17:10:17 +0400

erlang (1:15.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Upload to experimental because this release breaks external drivers
    API along with ABI, so several applications are to be fixed.
  * Removed SSL patch because the old SSL implementation is removed from
    the upstream distribution.
  * Removed never used patch which added native code to erlang beam files.
  * Removed the erlang-docbuilder binary package because the docbuilder
    application was dropped by upstream.
  * Documented dropping ${erlang-docbuilder:Depends} substvar in
    erlang-depends(1) manpage.
  * Made erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe provide virtual package
    erlang-abi-15.b (the number means the first erlang version, which
    provides current ABI).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Dec 2011 19:20:10 +0400

erlang (1:14.b.4-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Apr 2011 07:42:46 +0400

erlang (1:14.b.2-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed FTBFS because of missing snmpc.1 manpage when building architecture
    dependent packages only.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 01 Apr 2011 15:12:10 +0400

erlang (1:14.b.2-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #607233, #619857).
  * Removed patches which are no longer needed.
  * Created symlink to snmpc escript from /usr/bin directory. Added erlang-dev

  * Applised patch by upstream which fixes wx application crash
    (closes: #592821).
  * Switched to the old OpenSSL-based SSL implementation by default (it is
    still less buggy then the new one written in Erlang).
  * Enabled IPv6 for odbcserver and prefer IPv4 in odbc.erl to make odbc
    application working in IPv6-only environment (closes: #598525).
  * Overridden lintian error mesage about embedded pcre3 library because it
    is patched and cannot be replaced by a system one.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Nov 2010 12:25:50 +0300

    all versions of XEmacs because they don't contain flymake
    (closes: #588474).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.1.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 01 Aug 2010 15:08:02 +0400

erlang (1:14.a-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Refreshed patches.
  * Removed fix for re:compile/2 crash for a long regular expression because
    it is already included into the upstream source.
  * Since run_test is now a binary change the way it's put into the
    erlang-common-test package.
  * Split out architecture-independent erlang-ic-java package with Java
    classes. This also moves Java build-dependencies to build-depends-indep.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Jun 2010 17:39:38 +0400

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bashism in debian/rules (closes: #581450).
  * Added conflict of erlang-doc package with older erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages to prevent broken situation with erlang-base
    from stable (1:12.b.5) and erlang-doc from testing (1:13.b.4).
  * Added sun-java6-jdk as an alternative build dependency to make backporting
    to lenny and building on a headless machine possible.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Jun 2010 16:28:42 +0400

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Apr 2010 21:33:51 +0400

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed generation of ${erlang-base:Depends} and ${erlang-x11:Depends}
    substitution variables.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Mar 2010 09:02:05 +0300

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Manpages in section 1 are needed even if only arch-dependent packages are
    built. So, re-enabled them.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 09 Mar 2010 17:34:57 +0300

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed HiPE architecture recognition for powerpc Debian architecture.
  * Moved xsltproc and fop to build-depends-indep and do not build
    documentation if only architecture-specific packages are built.
  * Refreshed all patches.
  * Made Emacs look in man5 and man7 for Erlang manpages and added code
    skeleton files to erlang-mode package.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Mon, 08 Mar 2010 21:15:39 +0300

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Moved manpages from incorrect sections 4 and 6 to correct 5 and 7
    (closes: #498492).
  * Made manpages regexp in Emacs mode match only 3erl pages in section 3.
  * Removed docb_gen script which is no longer needed to build manpages.
  * Added erlang-doc package which contains documentation in HTML and PDF
    formats. This package replaces erlang-doc-html package and it's easier
    to synchronize it with the main Erlang packages as it's built from
    a single source package (closes: #558451).
  * Removed RPATH from ssl and crypto application binaries as required by
    Debian policy.
  * Added libwxgtk2.4-dev and libwxgtk2.6-dev to build conflicts.
  * Added a few dependencies for erlang-dialyzer, erlang-et, erlang-observer
    and erlang-examples packages which now call functions from more modules
    than in 1:13.b.3.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 05 Mar 2010 09:37:11 +0300

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a workaround which disables vfork() for hppa architecture
    (closes: #562218).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Feb 2010 10:49:00 +0300

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strictened check for JDK 1.5 adding a call to String(int[], int, int)
    because GCJ 4.4 doesn't implement it and OpenJDK isn't available for all
    architectures.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Feb 2010 10:28:44 +0300

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-manpages package section.
  * Made erlang-depends add only substvars which are requested in
    debian/control file. This minimizes number of warnings from dh_gencontrol.
    Also, improved descriptions of the functions in erlang-depends escript.
  * Added erlang-erl-docgen package to erlang-nox dependencies.
  * Made dummy packages erlang-nox and erlang-x11 architecture all.
  * Cleaned up working with custom substitution variables in debian/rules.
  * Reorganized debian/rules to ensure that manpages aren't built twice, and
    aren't built at all if only architecture-dependent packages are requested.
  * Fixed project links in README.Debian.
  * Added a new package erlang-jinterface which provides tools for
    communication of Java programs with Erlang processes. This adds build
    dependency on default-jdk and as a result enables Java module for IDL
    compiler.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.4.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 07 Feb 2010 15:01:16 +0300

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dialyzer(1) manpage which was placed into section 3 and conflicted
    with dialyzer(3erl).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Dec 2009 09:03:40 +0300

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refreshed patches, removed most of emacs.patch which is applied upstream.
  * Linked run_test binary from erlang-common-test package to /usr/bin.
  * Fixed VCS headers in debian/control.
  * Moved from prebuilt manpages to generated from sources. This adds
    erlang-manpages binary package and xsltproc build dependency.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Dec 2009 19:44:54 +0300

erlang (1:13.b.2.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #539269).
  * New maintainer's email address pkg-erlang-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
    mailing list.
  * Overridden another lintian warning about image file in /usr/lib.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Sep 2009 23:45:31 +0400

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored debug info in beam files for default build. It's better to use
    more space than to ship broken modules (debugger, dialyzer). The patch
    is simply commented out in debian/patches/series, so if someone has to
    strip debug info, he can simply uncomment it.
  * Disabled SMP support for hurd-i386 architecture, because of FTBFS in case
    when SMP is enabled.
  * Added debian/README.source file with a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.3.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Aug 2009 01:29:25 +0400

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed parentheses in Emacs mode (closes: #536891).
  * Removed unnecessary conflicts with erlang-manpages package.
  * Added workaround for #475459: disabled threads on sparc architecture.
    This breaks wxErlang, so it's only a temporary solution.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Wed, 05 Aug 2009 20:54:29 +0400

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made mutual dependencies of Erlang packages more parsimonious (removed
    unnecessary dependencies following erlang-depends advise).
  * Added several new options to erlang-depends tool (-v, -P, --ignore).
  * Made erlang-nox and erlang-x11 transitional packages (which will be
    removed after squeeze release).
  * Guarded change in the m68k patch for non-m68k architectures.
  * Fixed building Erlang VM with debug information compiled in. Added a few
    words about debug build to README.Debian.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Jul 2009 15:02:33 +0400

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed Torsten Werner from the uploaders list as per his request.
  * Removed full path from epmd calls in erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    prerm scripts.
  * Added ${erlang:Depends} substvar which expands into a list of Erlang
    packages which modules are actually used in application.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.2.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Jun 2009 14:13:14 +0400

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated manpages for section 1.
  * Applied patch by James Henstridge, which sets ERL_COMPILE_FLAGS based on
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. By default slim runtime without debug info is built.
    To remove slim option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'nostrip', to add debug_info
    compiler option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'debug'. Or it may be set to
    'nostrip,debug' to return to the previous level of debug information
    (closes: #532757).
  * Added a few words about building Erlang packages with debug info included
    to README.Debian.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Jun 2009 08:49:38 +0400

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed unnecessary dependency of erlang-os-mon on erlang-observer and
    erlang-tools and added missing dependency of erlang-nox on erlang-os-mon
    (closes: #529512).
  * Removed a patch to eunit application because the bug was fixed upstream.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Jun 2009 12:18:07 +0400

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed another bunch of non-free RFCs from original tarball
    (closes: #527053).
  * Fixed build-dependencies list by adding missing comma. This requires
    libsctp-dev again. Also, added libsctp1 dependency to erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages because the shared library is loaded via
    dlopen now and cannot be added using dh_slibdeps (closes: #526682).
  * Weakened dependency of erlang-webtool on erlang-observer to recommends
    to avoid circular dependencies (closes: #526627).
  * Added solaris-i386 to HiPE enabled architectures.
  * Made script sources in /usr/lib/erlang/erts-*/bin directory executable,
    which is more convenient if a user wants to create a target Erlang system.
  * Shortened extended description line for erlang-dev package to make it
    fit 80x25 terminals.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Thu, 07 May 2009 15:07:37 +0400

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up patches: removed unneeded patch which helped to support
    different SCTP library versions, made sure that changes for m68k
    architecture applied only when building on this architecture.
  * Removed duplicated information from binary packages descriptions.
  * Don't require libsctp-dev build-dependency on solaris-i386 architecture
    which allows to build Erlang on Nexenta (thanks to Tim Spriggs for
    the suggestion).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 01 May 2009 10:14:38 +0400

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Reduced number of packaged in build dependencies (removed unnecessary
    freeglut3-dev).
  * Added all new packages to erlang-depends script.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.
  * Temporarily changed architecture of erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages
    from all to any. Otherwise they will be broken during transition period
    when the new split Erlang is uploaded but isn't built on all architectures
    yet.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Added a patch by upstream to eunit application. It makes eunit compatible
    with Erlang R13B.

  * New upstream beta release.
  * Added packages libwxgtk2.8-dev, freeglut3-dev to build dependencies to make
    wxErlang buildable.
  * Split erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages into a bunch of smaller packages
    for individual Erlang/OTP applications. erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are still
    exist and depend on the correspondent packages.
  * Overridden lintian error 'embedded-zlib' because zlib included into Erlang
    VM is patched, so using system-wide zlib will lead to unknown consequences.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Apr 2009 16:32:04 +0400

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which fixes HTTP URI decoding if {packet, http} socket
    option is used.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-depends script to add optional dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    to ${erlang-base:Depends} substvar for all architecture-independent
    packages. Otherwise building them on different architectures will lead to
    different dependencies.
  * Added Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser headers to debian/control.
  * Removed package libgd2-xpm-dev from build dependencies which is not
    necessary anymore.
  * Added a patch which fixes detaching of erlang process from a controlling
    terminal (closes: #463538).

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed patches to re-enable building erlang regexp driver for common_test
    application on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Refreshed patches and made their description more clear.
  * Made dependencies of architecture-independent packages erlang,
    erlang-examples and erlang-src the same regardless of whether they are
    built on HiPE-enabled architecture or not.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jul 2008 09:18:15 +0400

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted erlang-base-hipe package priority to extra as it conflicts with
    erlang-base.
  * Added several substitution variables in debian/control to remove
    dependencies on hurd and erlang-base-hipe for architectures where these
    packages don't exist.

  * Removed perl from build dependencies because it is build-essential.
  * Added checks for error code 2 after quilt invocation which means that all

  * Relaxed suggested packages (removed versioned suggests) in debian/control.
  * Adjusted HiPE architecture from ppc64 to ppc if 32-bit code is generated

    package is useful even without X-Window system.
  * Weakened dependencies of erlang on erlang-src, erlang-examples and
    erlang-mode to make the package more robust in unstable during build
    cycles.
  * Moved several forgotten source directories to erlang-src.
  * Rewritten clean target in debian/rules to ignore only missing Makefile
    error.
  * Made clean-patched target in debian/rules depend on patch-stamp.
  * Moved erlang-nox and erlang-x11 menu items from Apps to Applications
    section.
  * Overridden lintian warning desktop-command-not-in-package since
    /usr/bin/erl is included into a package on which erlang-nox depends.
  * Fixed cleanup patch.
  * Added patch which defines MAXHOSTNAMELEN. It is harmless on all Linux
    architectures, but fixes orber building on hurd-i386.

    in ABI made by upstream. Also added ${erlang-abi:Depends} substitution
    variable to erlang-depends script.
  * Added Erlang homepage to debian/control.
  * Removed lintian override files for erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    since they are no longer needed. Also, removed override for
    binary-without-manpage from erlang-x11.lintian-override.
  * Converted erlang-nox and erlang-x11 to architecture-any packages and
    moved all relevant binaries from erlang-base to these packages.
  * Made erlang-base (and erlang-base-hipe) suggest erlang-nox and erlang-x11
    instead of recommending because the default aptitude behavior is to
    install recommended packages. This avoids installing X window system when

erlang (1:10.b.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Francois-Denis Gonthier ]
  * Disables HiPE build for hppa64 and m68k.
  * Upgraded policy version.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * disabled HiPE build an arm (not only armv4l)

erlang (1:10.b.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes: #366398: Same has #358410.
  * Closes: #357134: NMU of Luk Claes.  Most of those errors were already
    fixed in the new package.  Thanks.
  * Closes: #358179: Removed the copy of the LGPL in the copyright file.
    I've put the required shorter text.
  * Disabled HiPE build for mips, arm, mipsel, s390 and sparc, in hope
    that it fixes FTBFS on those platforms.
  * Closes: #358410.  erlang-src and erlang-mode are now Architecture:
    all.
  * erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are now built as arch-dependent targets
    since, practically, they depend on one of erlang-runtime to be
    built.
  * Added a link from /usr/lib/erlang/usr/include to /usr/include/erlang
    to fix potential FTBFS of dependencies of Erlang.
  * cant install erlang package (dependencie problem) (Closes: #366398)

erlang (1:10.b.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes: #333853, moved driver_int.h and erl_driver.h to
    /usr/include.
  * Closes: #331817, added debconf-2.0 alternative to erlang
    dependencies.
  * Closes: #344118, added a missing "," in Depends in the
    control file.
  * Removed dependency to bash v3, which means Erlang 10.b.9-2 is
    backportable to Sarge thanks to Sergei Golovan.
  * 10.b.9-1 was a test version that was announced on the erlang-
    questions mailing list.
  * erlang-manpages: Manpages are not where erl -man looks for them
    (Closes: #348333). erl -man is now using the standard manual path
    and MANSECT=1:3erl:4:6.
  * /usr/bin/ear is a dangling symlink (Closes: #346548)
  * Removed ear, ecc, elink, escript, which are bad links produced even
    by the standard erlang install (I sure should ask erlang-questions
    about those).
  * FTBFS: build-depends on removed xlibs-dev (Closes: #346655)

erlang (1:10.b.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * HiPE-enabled binaries are now put in their own package.
  * Source files (*.erl, *.hrl, *.c and *.h) are now put in their own
    package since they are not required to use the system.
  * Well, I have dpatch'ified the thing but since I now use svn-
    buildpackage locally, the patches are not rather useless.
  * Closes: #333853
  * Closes: #331817
  * Major rules overhaul.  I've had some problems getting some targets
    to run twice but I worked around them.

erlang (1:10.b.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version
  * fully dpatch'ified.
  * Emacs editing mode pulled from the main package and put into it's
    own erlang-mode package.
  * As it was suggested a few times, I've split the main arch-
    independent package in two.  There is now an erlang-nox package
    which include the base applications that don't require tk8.4 to
    work.  The applications that depend on gs and thus on tk8.4 and now
    in erlang-x11.
  * The files that go in the 3 packages are now determined using regular
    expressions.  See analyse.sh for details.

erlang (1:10.b.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now using autooconf2.5x
  * The whole package is now dpatch'ified.
  * I've simplified the aggressive cleaning done in the clean phase of
    debian/rules.  It doesn't mean that it was wrong, but right now I
    don't fully understand the need for it.  I take care of preserving
    the pristine content of the bootstrap directory instead of using the
    weird preservebeam script.  I suspect that might be causing some
    problems on some platforms although I don't really know why.

    - Emulator crash with bignums corrected.
    - HIPE updated to correct a bug that caused the emulator to crash.
  * Added a 'conflicts' with libxmerl-erlang, since 'xmerl' is now
    distributed with Erlang OTP.  Perhaps we need some way to allow this
    to be upgraded if xmerl has interim releases...

erlang (1:9.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Erlang won't build on other architectures because of my monkeying
    around with 'ecc'.  Too many scripts depend on it being named
    'ecc' and located in /usr/bin/ecc.  And I'm not sure how many
    external Erlang programs make this assumption.  Going back to

  * Move all Java stuff into erlang-base, declare as binary-indep, and
    remove build-depends on Java (since autobuilders don't need to build
    these parts.)  Since the java-stuff is not critical to the function
    of Erlang, modify build rules to ignore failure if 'javac' does not
    exist, for example.
