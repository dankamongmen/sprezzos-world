      invasive than the 0.8.x iterations of this, since it was run on the same
      machine as the upstream tarballs were generated from.  I'm not applying
      this upstream, since it has no business here.  If anything should be
      patched, it should be autoconf.

    only x-dev and libx11-dev are installed (which are the only XFree86
    packages that Xrender needs to actually build).   Re-run aclocal &&
    automake --foreign && autoconf to resynchronize with change to
    configure.ac.  Fixes FTBFS; thanks to Jurij Smakov for this patch.
    (Closes: #233969)

xrender (0.8.3-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency due to fix for grave bug.

  * Each of libxrender1, libxrender1-dbg, and libxrender-dev now conflict with
    their xlibs counterparts versioned less than 4.2.1, because the Xrender
    shared objects and related files in xlibs 4.1.0 are named
    "libXrender.so.1.0", not "libXrender.so.1.1" as the dpkg-divert commands
    in the xrender package's maintainer scripts expect.  This prevents
    libxrender1 from being removed.  We also can't add conditionals to handle
    this because the user might upgrade xlibs to 4.2.1 in the meantime.

xrender (0.8.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean up package's build-dependencies and dependencies.
    - debian/control:
      + drop versioning of build-dependency on xlibs-dev; all that is needed
        is libX11.so.6, and any version of xlibs-dev provides that
      + drop libxrender1's dependency on xlibs (>> 4.2.1); dpkg-shlibdeps adds
        an adequate dependency on xlibs
      + drop libxrender1-dbg's dependency on xlibs-dbg (>> 4.2.1); this isn't
        a true dependency, so let's get rid of it
      + drop versioning of libxrender-dev's dependency on xlibs-dev; all that
        is needed is libX11.so.6, and any version of xlibs-dev provides that
      + and dependency of libxrender-dev on render-dev

  * Clarify wording in packages' extended descriptions.
    - debian/control:
      + Remove redundant-through-implication sentence from libxrender1's
        description.
      + Simplify the message to non-programmers in libxrender1-dbg's
        description.
      + Simplify the wording regarding what is provided by the libxrender-dev
        package.

  * Stop using DEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS entirely in the rules file;
    AC_PATH_XTRA does indeed seem to work adequately.
    - debian/rules

  * Stop using DEB_DH_MAKESHLIBS_ARGS_ALL entirely in the rules file; since
    libXrender has retained forward-compatibility since its first package
    release, it's fine to let dh_makeshlibs operate in its default manner.
    - debian/rules

  * Change maintainer to Debian X Strike Force, and add uploaders field to
    include myself.
    - debian/control

  * Steal patch from upstream CVS that works around breakage in the Xinerama
    implementation in the XFree86 X server, which only reports depths with an
    associated visual, when it should return all available depths.  Thanks to
    Marc Wilson for help tracking down the problem and the solution, and Nate
    Turner for confirming the fix.  (Closes: #215845)

xrender (0.8.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium because the problem fixed by this release bites a lot of
    KDE users who are using XFree86 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 Debian packages.

  * Add new diversion of the actual old libXrender shared object (as opposed
    to diverting only the symlinks).  This is necessary because ldconfig will
    recreate the libXrender.so.1 symbolic link in /usr/X11R6/lib, which causes
    major confusion (and possibly errors from the dynamic loader) for anything
    that searches /usr/X11R6/lib before /usr/lib.
    /usr/X11R6/lib/libXrender.so.1.1 is now being diverted to
    /usr/X11R6/lib/xlibs.libXrender-1.1.so.1.1.  The diversion's name has to
    have "xlibs." preprended because ldconfig will attempt to operate on
    any plain file matching "lib*.so*".
    - debian/libxrender1.preinst
    - debian/libxrender1.postrm

  * Under duress, ship a symlink from /usr/X11R6/lib/libXrender.la to
    /usr/lib/libXrender.la.  There appears to be a bug in libtool that that
    compels it to place absolute paths to .la files in other .la files.
    This symlink should allow a transition to a non-broken libtool (or the
    eventual recompilation of all libraries that transitively depend on
    libXrender, which is a lot of them) and will be removed in the future.
    - debian/libxrender-dev.links

  * Set AM_MAINTAINER_MODE because we do not want automake running during
    Debian package builds.
    - configure.ac

  * Run aclocal && automake --foreign && autoconf to resynchronize with
    change to configure.ac.
    - Makefile.in

    - debian/control: add build-dependency on cdbs (>= 0.4.12)
    - debian/rules: translated to CDBS-speak
    - debian/*.install: update to be correct with the way CDBS uses dh_install

  * Move files from /usr/X11R6 to /usr where possible.  (The only exception is
    the Xrender.h, which is expected to be found in
    <X11/extensions/Xrender.h>, so has to be shipped in
    /usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions.)
    - debian/*.install: update paths
    - debian/rules: stop passing --includedir and --libdir to configure
    - debian/control: update instructions for using LD_LIBRARY_PATH

xrender (0.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

xrender (0.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

      application crashes with BadValue X protocol errors, particularly in
      gnome-terminal and mozilla-xft (Closes: #181815)

  * {Makefile.am,xrender.pc.in}: Upstream hasn't quite gotten rid of its
    libXext dependency yet; Xrenderint.h still makes reference to
    XMissingExtension().  Therefore, Xrender itself, and objects that link
    against libXrender, should also link against libXext.
  * {Makefile.in,aclocal.m4,config.guess,config.sub,configure}: regenerated
    with automake 1.7.4 and friends

  * Until XFree86 4.3.0 is released to Debian unstable:
    - the libxrender1 package will depend on xlibs (>> 4.2.1) and dpkg-divert
      its libXrender.so.1 symlink

      dpkg-divert its libXrender.so.1 symlink
