Description: GObject based collection library
 libgee is a collection library providing GObject-based interfaces and
 classes for commonly used data structures.
 .
 libgee provides the following interfaces:
  * Iterable
   * Collection
    * List
    * Set
  * Iterator
  * Map
 .
 The ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap classes provide a reasonable sample
 implementation of the List, Set, and Map interfaces. ReadOnlyCollection,
 ReadOnlyList, ReadOnlySet, and ReadOnlyMap are read-only wrapper classes
 that prevent modification of the underlying collection.
 .
 libgee is written in Vala and can be used like any GObject-based C library.
 It's planned to provide bindings for further languages.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.
