mutt (1.5.21-2) experimental; urgency=low
  mailto-mutt has been replaced by a wrapper as per #576313, because mutt is now
  able to handle the mailto: urls; additionally it will also do some checks on
  attachments and it will allow us to be as close to upstream as possible

mutt (1.5.20-6) unstable; urgency=low
  The behavior of the write_bcc option has changed, now write_bcc is only
  used to decide if an Fcc message should have its Bcc header written;
  if the message is sent outside using SMTP the Bcc header will never be
  written, see the description of debian-specific/467432-write_bcc.patch
  for details

mutt (1.5.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As result of http://bugs.mutt.org/3097 getopt() is now used in a way that
  behaves consistently on all POSIX systems, unfortunately this has broken
  the way attachments are added from the command line.
  Now "--" is mandatory *before* any address if a file is attached from CLI,
  the mutt manpage correctly documents this behavior.

mutt (1.5.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  There is now a "mutt-patched" package that will contain some more
  experimental patches. For now that is the "sidebar" patch. See
  README.Patches for details.

mutt (1.5.14+cvs20070301-1) experimental; urgency=low

  We no longer unset write_bcc in /etc/Muttrc. If your MTA does not strip Bcc:
  headers, edit /etc/Muttrc. (exim4 and postfix strip them, exim(3) does not.)
  We also no longer unset use_from and use_domain. Mutt will use the contents
  of /etc/mailname to determine the domain part of the From: header.

  This release adds ESMTP support to mutt. To use, set smtp_url to your
  smarthost, e.g. smtps://mail.company.com/.

  The gpgme crypt backend is now enabled.

mutt (1.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  In this release the alternates, lists, and subscribe configuration
  variables have been turned into regular expression lists.
  Additionaly, alternates is now an option, not a  variable.
  This means that you should change:

  set alternates="foo|bar"

  into

  alternates "foo|bar"

  in your .muttrc file. See muttrc(5) for details.
