xine-lib (1.1.16.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Darren Salt ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Fix another possible int overflow in the 4XM demuxer.
      (ref. TKADV2009-004, CVE-2009-0698) (Closes: #517792)
    - Fix an integer overflow in the Quicktime demuxer.
    - Fix audio/video desynchronisation issues. (Closes: #521269)

  * Post-release patches from upstream:
    - Correct invalid MIME info in the MOD demuxer.
    - Fix a resource leak in libdvdnav.
    - Properly NUL-terminate when reading ID3v2.2 tag content.
    - Fix calculation of length of UTF-16 content sourced from, e.g., ID3 tags.

  * Update the home page link in debian/control.
    xinehq.de is missing presumed 410, and we now have www.xine-project.org.
  * Update debian/copyright.
    The authors list is probably not complete, and is certainly not wrt
    AUTHORS, but the removed entries are relevant only to front ends.
  * Update copyright information somewhat.
    [WIP.]
  * Sync Section information with the archive – mostly. libxine1-console
    belongs in section "libs" since, like libxine1-x, it's required by some
    front ends; and libxine1-bin belongs there too, as it's required by other
    libxine1* packages.
  * Add dh_xine, for use when building front ends.
  * Don't build-depend on libmagick-dev since it can pull in
    graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat, which causes the image decoder
    plugin not to be built → FTBFS.

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]

    The problem was an incorrect debian/shlibs.local.	(Closes: #457328)
  * Use a symlink for libxine1-dbg's documentation (this got missed in -4).
  * libxine1-bin (-4) should have contained AUTHORS. This is fixed.

  * libxine1-dbg was missing some debug symbols. Fixed by building it after
    xine-lib's other arch:any packages.
  * Introduce a new package, libxine1-bin, which contains the binaries
    formerly in libxine1. Dependencies are moved and updated accordingly.
    thanks to Bill Allombert.  (Closes: #454267)
  * Except for libxine1-doc, libxine1-bin and libxine-dev, symlink to
    libxine1-bin's documentation. (AUTHORS is now in libxine1-bin.)
  * Backported patches from upstream 1.1 branch:
    - Fix compilation of DXR3 support with external ffmpeg.
      This is currently only needed for compilation against libavcodeccvs-dev
      (from debian-multimedia). Untested with actual DXR3 hardware since I
      have none.                                           (cset e55bc398cc7c)

xine-lib (1.1.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [Reinhard Tartler]
  * use dh_listpackages instead of hardcoded list for determining the
    provided binary packages.
  * Bug fix: "Depends->Recommends dependency change breaking other
    packages", thanks to Christoph Pfister and Sune Vuorela
    (Closes: #439389)
    - introduce new package libxine1-misc-plugins, which contains
      (nearly) all plugins formerly found in the package libxine1.
    - promote all dependencies of libxine1-misc-plugins to Depends.
    - Make libxine1 depend on libxine1-plugins | libxine1-misc-plugins.
      Apt will prefer the first alternative, which results many
      plugins installed by default. Caveat: If one plugin package has
      unsatisfiable dependencies, the user will end up with only
      libxine1-misc-plugins installed.
    - Make libxine1-plugins depend on libxine1-misc-plugins.
    - Make libxine1-plugins not depend on libxine1-console.
    - NB: From now on, frontends need to explicitly depend on either
      libxine1-x or libxine1-console, depending on whether they are
      console based (like cacaxine or fbxine) or X11 based (like gxine).
      libxine1-plugins will not depend on libxine1-x or libxine1-console.
  * Make libxine1-dev Arch:any. Being arch:all makes a lot of trouble
    building frontends on architectures that are out of sync.
  * Remove alternative depends on libz-dev (not found even in oldstable)
    and slang1-dev (not found in stable, only oldstable) from libxine1-dev.
  * Add Homepage field to debian/control

  [Darren Salt]
  * Add patches from upstream:
    - DVD MRL title.chapter fix
  * Move libxine1-doc into section "doc".
  * Improve package descriptions a bit; in particular, a grammatical
    correction for libxine1-console, and an extra sentence describing common
    uses of libxine1-ffmpeg.
  * New package libxine1-x, which contains the X-based video output plugins.
    These were previously in libxine1.
  * Move the fb video output plugin into libxine1-console.

         patch by Chris Brien
         1) Return the stream length correctly. This fixes a FIXME.
         2) Set the width and height metadata.
         3) Reset the demuxer status to DEMUX_OK on seek.

        Update API for libcaca 0.99. Patch by cjacker huang.
        Update libcaca check to use the pkg-config file shipped with libcaca
        0.99, and change --disable-caca to --without-caca (to conform with
        other external libraries).
        Remove reference to removed caca.m4 (libcaca 0.99 will use
        pkg-config).
        Removed m4/caca.m4 (Closes: #386745)
  * Dropped Replaces on xine-dvdnav (only in woody) and xine (only in
    potato!)
  * Dropping Conflicts on sinek and xine-ui (<< 0.9.10) (all only woody)
  * cleaning m4/caca.m4, no longer used
  * removing doc/faq/faq.html doc/faq/faq.txt doc/hackersguide/hackersguide.html 
    on clean, missed by build system
  * include some targets to build 'orig' tarballs from the current branch.
    This mainly for my convinience for bootstrapping cvs versions of xine and
    preparing tarballs for the 'main' section of ubuntu, which I carry here in
    order to minimize divergence

xine-lib (1.1.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * build against external liba52
  * Bug fix: "libxine1: Please use the Debian ffmpeg version", thanks to
    Josselin Mouette. Please note that the ffmpeg version used has WMV3
    support. Unfortunately, this version of xine cannot use that support
    yet. This is 1.1.3 stuff. (Closes: #367095).
  * Bug fix: "libxine1: Please support m4b files", thanks to Johannes
    Adams. Bugfix by copying src/demuxers/demux_qt.c from CVS
    version. (Closes: #384435).
  * Build against internal libvcdinfo for now and add libvcdinfo-dev to
    build-conflicts. This is a workaround for Bug: #364837, using internal
    libvcdinfo makes the segfault go away.
  * install a note for reportbug users
  * cleanup (actually remove) confusing and unnecessary documentation.
  * fetch bug from upstream cvs to fix bug where incorrect aspect ratio was
    being passed to post plugins up (src/post/planar/expand.c, rev 1.16)
  * add build dependency on sgmltools-lite to build faq
  * add build dependencies transfig and gs to correctly build the
    hackersguide
  * bump shlibs to this revision because of changes in libcaca output plugin

  * New upstream release: 1.1.2
  * use internal ffmpeg for upload to unstable, we will reinvestigate again
    in experimental later..
  * [sparc] Upstream fixed '--enable-vis'. So if compiling with vis, we are
    using -mcpu=v9. This creates binaries, which probably segfault on 'true'
    sparc32, but these poor old machines are not going to have much fun with
    xine anyway... If there is an increasing demand for non-vis sparc
    binaries, please contact me
  * updated README.Debian

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]

  * Use external libmad, acknowledging NMU (Closes: #336437)
  * enable support for libxvmc1, now that we have xorg in debian
    (Closes: #281572)
  * Conflict/Replaces obsolete package 'xine' (Closes: #300852)
  * Incorporated Darren's changes into a new maintainer upload.
  * medium urgency, although security fixes a lot of other functionality
    changes
  * Some more fixages to inline usage in internal copy of ffmpeg, continuing
    the patch from Darren Salt.
  * Verified that this upload fixes build on mips, and other build failiures
    look pretty similar. Therefore (Closes: #354436)
  * Verified that /usr/share/doc/libxine1/faq/faq.{html,txt} is now installed
    correctly (Closes: #369658)
  * fix gnome-vfs plugin to allow play back of http URLs again. Patch from
    upstream CVS, thank you for pointing this out, Sam Morris (Closes: #369974)

  [ Darren Salt ]

   * SECURITY FIXES (closes: #369876):
    - Possible buffer overflow in the AVI demuxer, caused by
      specially-crafted files or streams;
    - Possible buffer overflow in the HTTP header-fetching code.
      (CVE-2006-2802)

  * Tidy up the FAQ list and README installation to quieten dh_install.
  * Re-update the FSF address in debian/copyright. It got lost in 1.1.1-1.
  * Add build-dep alternatives for those of us who do backports to sarge.
  * Tidy up the package descriptions a little.
  * Bump shlibs to >= 1.1.0 due to new functions. (Closes: #358429, #368247)
  * Empty config file no longer prevents the config from being saved.
    (Fixed in upstream 1.1.1) (Closes: #320164)
  * Pulled in some patches from CVS:
    - the above security fixes;
    - fix ALSA resume-from-suspend;
    - fix incorrect size calculation in interlaced Matroska demuxing;
    - various uninitialised variables, some of which should be non-zero;
    - HTTP MRLs requiring authentication would only work when using a proxy;
    - fix possibly-broken locale handling in the SMB input plugin;
    - avoid problems where the ffmpeg audio decoder can't find a codec;
    - avoid a couple of compiler warnings (libavutil);
    - fix up some typecasting in the win32 codec interface;
    - avoid problems with negative sizes (general demuxing);
    - some plugin cache reading code should also be used on ia64;
    - fix a couple of printf warnings on 64-bit;
    - add some locking around playback speed change code;
    - incorrect default CPU acceleration setting on powerpc;
    - fix crash at startup if VO deinterlacing is enabled, onefield_xv is
      selected and the image format is YV12;
    - avoid possible segfault with 1x1 PNGs when handled by the ffmpeg plugin;
    - wrong names used for libX11 and libXv in the health check code (we now
      detect the correct names at build time);
    - add a missing -I to src/libffmpeg/libavcodec/sparc/Makefile.am (should
      fix an FTBFS on sparc);
    - alter configure.ac to avoid FTBFS when configure is regenerated with
      autoconf 2.59c or later.
  * Add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE.
  * Fix usage of inlined functions in libffmpeg before they're defined. This is
    not implemented for all architectures in gcc 4.0.x and was causing FTBFS.
  * Kill some pointer<->int casting warnings on 64-bit architectures. (Taken
    from CVS HEAD)

xine-lib (1.0.1-1.3) unstable; urgency=low
  * Non-maintainer upload.

  * Backport patch from 1.0.2 that fixes hard hang-ups when a plugin listed in
    ~/.xine/catalog.cache becomes unloadable (closes: #328454). Plugins can   
    become unloadable if DT_NEEDED libraries get uninstalled, which is
    possible because the package lists many of these libraries in the 
    Recommends or Suggests fields only. With this fix, amarok should not
    freeze with the XINE engine anymore (closes: #327203), and totem either
    (closes: #328265).

    Patch included in debian/patches/fix-hangs-at-load-time.diff, but since
    there's no patch applying code in debian/rules, it's present in the
    .diff.gz as well.

  * Fix the script that invokes dpkg-shlibdeps to split dependencies among
    Depends, Recommends, and Suggests: it generated empty fields if one of the
    expected plugins was not actually available. (Closes: #328184)

    This means that now the package now suggests libgnomevfs2-0 (closes:
    #326935) and libflac7 (closes: #328168). Submitters may wish to reopen if
    they want a discussion with the maintainer about the need of these being 
    strong Depends instead of Suggests.

  * xineplug_flac.so now links against libflac7 instead of libflac6, which
    closes: #325960 (the FLAC transition bug).

xine-lib (1.0.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Medium-urgency upload for RC bugfixes.
  * Multiple fixes for compatibility with gcc 4.0 strictness
    (closes: #288189, #318838)
  * This rebuild also gets rid of the dependency on libslang1
    (closes: #315986); it only trades it for libslang2 unfortunately, 
    since libcaca is a static lib.
  * Build-Depend on libaa1-dev instead of the removed aalib1-dev
    (closes: #320317).
  * Build-Depend on libxinerama-dev instead of on xlibs-static-dev,
    which no longer provides this lib; it should be rolled back into
    xlibs-dev as a dependency eventually, but build-depending on it 
    directly is sensible anyway.
  * Disentangle xine from libraries it doesn't actually use directly, so
    that the dependency tree is less brittle and requires fewer rebuilds
    in the future (e.g., it currently has a dependency on libstdc++5
    that it shouldn't need at all); this is doubly important since some
    plugins aren't mentioned at all in the dependencies, and so can be 
    left unusable by library changes:
    - relibtoolize the package to use the Debian version of libtool,
      with support for pruning indirect dependencies from the linker
      commandline
    - as part of the above, add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to configure.ac to
      avoid any need for autotools build-dependencies
    - hard-code -lmodplug, -lartsc, and -lgnomevfs-2, because pkg-config,
      artsc-config, etc. spit out lib dependencies that are spurious on  
      GNU/* systems.
