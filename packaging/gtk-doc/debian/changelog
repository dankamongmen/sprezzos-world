  * debian/patches/10_cvs_allow-colon-in-sgml-ids.patch: allow colons in SGML
    ID/IDREF attributes, hence permit the usage of ":CAPS".  Jade was correct

    attributes for macros starting with "_".  It seems jade doesn't accept ":"
    in ID/IDREF, so we workaround it.  Upstream seems to agree with this
    renaming.
