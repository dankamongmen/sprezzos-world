base-passwd (3.5.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on dpkg (>= 1.16.4) | sgml-base (<< 1.26+nmu2) to ensure
    that #675613 does not cause incorrect generation of documentation
    (closes: #678570).

base-passwd (3.5.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * users-and-groups: Document historical meaning of sys user/group (thanks
    to Mantas M. for the tip).
  * Use dpkg-buildflags to enable hardening options (based on a patch from
    Moritz Muehlenhoff; closes: #655501).
  * Update users-and-groups documentation of the sudo group to describe
    current behaviour and mention pkexec (thanks, Luca Capello; closes:
    #650553).

base-passwd (3.5.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mark base-passwd Multi-Arch: foreign.

base-passwd (3.5.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert to source format 3.0 (native).
  * Update to current DEP-5 copyright proposal (thanks, Kyle Nitzsche; part
    of LP #610108).
  * Remove unused Lintian overrides.
  * Add translations of update-passwd(8):
    - Spanish (thanks, Omar Campagne; closes: #604455).
    - Japanese (thanks, KURASAWA Nozomu; closes: #614377).
    - German (thanks, Helge Kreutzmann; closes: #625898).
  * Allocate gid 64040-64044 (grsec-tpe, grsec-sock-all, grsec-sock-clt,
    grsec-sock-srv, grsec-proc) for linux-grsec-base, by request of
    Yves-Alexis Perez.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Jul 2011 12:52:47 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compress files using gzip -n (cf. debhelper 6.0.6).
  * Remove explicit calls to install-docs (cf. debhelper 7.2.3).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 07 Sep 2009 00:07:19 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set up the root user without a password by default, rather than giving
    it an empty password. In this day and age the latter is not really a
    defensible default (LP: #296841).
  * Update description of dip group, based on a suggestion by Osamu Aoki
    (closes: #512938).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Mar 2009 13:37:23 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.20) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Document that the staff group is typically root-equivalent (thanks, Guy
    Hulbert).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 06 Feb 2009 16:20:12 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allocate uid/gid 64035 for hacluster/haclient (Horms, closes: #494070).
  * Moved to bzr.debian.org; add Vcs-Bzr control field.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 06 Sep 2008 15:27:12 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.18) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 07 Jul 2008 15:11:07 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * hal was renamed to haldaemon in hal 0.5.7.1-1 (closes: #452631).
  * Make the description of plugdev in users-and-groups slightly more
    generic; I don't want to end up having to list all the programs that
    implement it, but "can access removable devices" should be good enough
    (closes: #285732).
  * Add Russian translation of update-passwd(8) (thanks, Yuri Kozlov;
    closes: #461732).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Jan 2008 14:43:50 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Register users-and-groups with doc-base (closes: #451680).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Nov 2007 00:44:46 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use autotools-dev's recommended ./configure --build and --host options
    (closes: #451123).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Nov 2007 20:00:42 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allocate uid/gid 64030 for slurm (Gennaro Oliva, closes: #444412).
  * Update to Autoconf 2.61.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Nov 2007 10:40:26 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * users-and-groups improvements from Justin Pryzby (closes: #440306):
    - jabberd no longer runs as daemon.
    - www-data no longer owns log files as of apache2.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 31 Aug 2007 13:58:21 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change section to admin, matching the override file.
  * Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip (closes: #436542).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 08 Aug 2007 11:44:44 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update GPL notices with the FSF's new address.
  * Add po4a infrastructure and French translation of update-passwd(8)
    (thanks, Nicolas François; closes: #326550).
  * Fix syntax error in ssh group documentation.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Dec 2005 10:51:34 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove preinst, for several reasons:
    - the 'dpkg --assert-support-predepends' check isn't guaranteed to be
      effective anyway (it tests the current version of dpkg on the system,
      not the one that's performing the upgrade);
    - dpkg has supported Pre-Depends since 1996;
    - it unnecessarily required dpkg to have been configured when running
      base-passwd.preinst (#316084).
  * users-and-groups improvements from David Mandelberg (closes: #290237):
    - Document messagebus, postfix, hal, gdm, saned, klog, and syslog users
      and groups.
    - Document sshd, fetchmail, and cupsys users.
    - Document lpadmin, sasl, scanner, and ssh groups.
    - Correct "writeable" to "writable" throughout.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Jun 2005 15:01:00 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add and document static group plugdev, gid 46, for use by pmount and
    similar tools to allow local users to mount removable devices without
    the need for entries in /etc/fstab (closes: #283233).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Dec 2004 10:15:06 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix typoes in README.
  * Clarify in README that packages may not make use of ids in the
    60000-64999 range without *first* having them allocated by this package.
  * Allocate static uid/gid 64025 for vpopmail/vchkpw (Pawel Wiecek,
    closes: #270719).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Sep 2004 00:06:00 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve documentation of 'operator' (Peter Benie).
  * In fact, remove the 'operator' user (not group) entirely from new
    installations. It will not be automatically removed from existing
    installations. Its uses are historical and not well-supported by Debian
    anyway, and a local administrator can easily set up something
    appropriate without it having to be in everyone's /etc/passwd file
    (closes: #198943).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Jan 2004 14:40:21 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Show names of groups when changing users' group ids (closes: #217511).
    This incidentally means that group has to be updated before passwd,
    since groups might be changed in the same update-passwd run.
  * Update Standards-Version: to 3.6.0. Higher policy versions require
    prompting via debconf, which is a major code change that hasn't been
    done yet.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Jan 2004 11:58:19 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add md5sums control file.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue,  9 Dec 2003 02:24:15 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move the man pages into their own directory in the source package.
  * Change irc's home directory to /var/run/ircd, which seems to exist in
    most ircd-providing packages (closes: #198913).
  * Update Standards-Version: to 3.5.10.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Jun 2003 23:45:58 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The noautoadd flag has been broken since 3.2.0: update-passwd was
    looking at the wrong id. Fortunately, since noautoadd entries aren't in
    the master files, this didn't matter except that it caused a segfault on
    empty system files (closes: #189196).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Apr 2003 13:44:55 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix groff problems, mainly the use of "-", throughout update-passwd(8).
    I've attempted to keep the Polish translation in step.
  * Allocate static uid/gid 64020 for asterisk (Jeff Noxon).
  * Update Standards-Version: to 3.5.9.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Apr 2003 15:14:49 +0100

base-passwd (3.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * For consistency with the rest of group.master, don't put the lp user in
    its group explicitly. We pick that up from passwd.master already.
  * Avoid using the 'users' group for any system users (part of #25882):
    - Change the sync user's group to nogroup.
    - Change the games user's group to be the already-existing games group.
    - Create a man group (gid 12) and set that as the man user's group.
  * Don't use 'command -v' in postinst; include a pure shell implementation
    instead.
  * Make '[' argument syntax in postinst strict enough that posh can cope
    with it.
  * Change nobody's home directory to /nonexistent (the name is mostly for
    documentation purposes), following the BSDs (closes: #135732).
  * Strip update-passwd after installing it into the temporary tree, not
    before.
  * Fix a segfault while removing accounts.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Feb 2003 01:35:18 +0000

base-passwd (3.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the postgres user and group for new installations, although not
    on upgrades. postgresql 7.1release-3 and up will create a user and group
    for itself in the system range (closes: #81222, #95557).
  * When using fget*ent_r(), we're supposed to reallocate larger and larger
    chunks of memory until we find one in which each passwd/group/shadow
    line fits, and there's an arbitrary limit on the length of lines because
    we don't. Since update-passwd is single-threaded, this is unnecessary;
    just use fget*ent() and copy the returned structures (closes: #109038).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Feb 2003 00:25:32 +0000

base-passwd (3.4.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clarify description (thanks, Filip Van Raemdonck; closes: #178170).
  * Make -v/--verbose, and thus the postinst, a little less verbose. A
    second -v option restores the previous level of verbosity.
  * Build with -Wall. Implement DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt.
  * users-and-groups:
    - Add Robert Bihlmeyer's comments about daemon, sys, tty, lp, and
      nogroup (closes: #178460).
    - Improvements to nobody/nogroup and operator documentation suggested by
      Tony Finch.
    - Include LSB 1.3 comments on bin and daemon.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat,  1 Feb 2003 18:01:49 +0000

base-passwd (3.4.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build users-and-groups.txt as well as users-and-groups.html.
  * Clarify the purpose of group mail a little.
  * Per Debian policy, utmp can write to /var/log/wtmp and /var/log/lastlog
    as well, so document this.
  * Update Standards-Version: to 3.5.8.
  * Correct "changing shell" message to print both the original and new
    values (thanks, Joost van Baal; closes: #178057).
  * Include Polish translation of update-passwd(8) (thanks, Marcin Owsiany;
    closes: #160146).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Jan 2003 19:27:09 +0000

base-passwd (3.4.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix a thinko that caused update-passwd never to add new passwd/group
    entries unless a NIS compat entry was present (closes: #174187).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Dec 2002 17:46:39 +0000

base-passwd (3.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Downcase the short description, apart from "Debian" (closes: #134614).
  * Add initial informative documentation of the global static users and
    groups (closes: #50304). This is a work in progress, so feel free to
    send suggestions and corrections.
  * Ensure that new entries are added before "+" entries (which ignore the
    rest of the file and switch to NIS) (closes: #166756). Existing entries
    are reordered if and only if they're in the master files. See #130735.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Dec 2002 13:21:46 +0000

base-passwd (3.4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. Thanks, Wichert.
  * Don't fail to configure if nscd isn't running (closes: #166606).
  * Fix typo in update-passwd's usage output (closes: #139981).
  * Print old value of gecos / home directory / shell as well as new value
    (closes: #136227).
  * Fix strip argument typo in debian/rules.
  * Change gecos for list to "Mailing List Manager" (closes: #149466).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Nov 2002 03:15:06 +0000

  * Change directory for gnats to /var/lib/gnats on new installs. Do
    not change it for existing systems. Closes: Bug#133121

 -- Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 19:44:57 +0100

  * Fix typo in postinst prompt. Closes: Bug#130662
  * Remove ancient code from Galen from the source
  * Relicense under just version 2 of the GNU GPL
  * Check for noninteractive debconf frontend and handle redirected
    input in the postinst. Closes: Bug#130362
  * Correct extension of backup file in postinst. Closes: Bug#130366
  * Remove all Linux references
  * Be even more paranoid in fputpwent so we can handle syntactically
    incorrect entries as well. Closes: Bug#130192
  * Remove bashisms from debian/rules
  * Do a better job at stripping update-passwd

 -- Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jan 2002 16:44:28 +0100
 
base-passwd (3.2.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Major paper brown bag release
  * Do not swap uid and gid in putpwent. Closes: Bug#130032
  * If we are upgrading from 3.2.2 explain the uid/gid problem and
    offer to restore the previous passwd file

 -- Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Jan 2002 17:08:01 +0100

base-passwd (3.2.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Implement our own putpwent since the GNU libc version will happily 
    give root access to everyone when encountering NIS compat entries.
    Closes: Bug#123345
  * Fix typo in error message when reading group files
  * Remove majordomo user and group from master passwd and group files
    Closes: Bug#108071,#87214
  * Change mail homedirectory to /var/mail. Closes: Bug#95670
  * Improve test for nscd presence. Hopefully Closes: Bug#95479
  * Include section and priority in control file

 -- Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Jan 2002 18:18:17 +0100

base-passwd (3.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use a 8192 byte buffer for reading passwd and group entries. If
    someone has a group with over 8kb of group members we will still
    break (libc has no way to prevent that), but such a system will
    be so rate I doubt we will even run into it.
    Closes: Bug#51577,#51692,#69819
  * Tell nscd to invalidate the user and group cache if we make any
    changes. Closes: Bug#51943
  * Fix a typo in the update-passwd manpage. Closes: Bug#53857,#75791
  * Don't create the msql user and group anymore by default.
    Closes: Bug#55878,#87213
  * Don't create the dos user and group anymore by default. Closes: Bug#69485
  * Note that tac-plus uses the static uid and gid 64005. Closes: Bug#63759

 -- Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Apr 2001 20:30:49 +0200

base-passwd (3.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.2.1
  * Modify update-passwd to use seperate flag lists for users and
    groups
  * Actually honour noautoadd flag
  * Use asprintf so we are no longer bound by PATH_MAX limits. This
    has the unfortunate side effect of making update-passwd dependent
    on glibc. We'll deal with that when somebody files a bugreport.

 -- Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Oct 2000 14:09:52 +0200

  * Leave a backup file for modified files. Closes: Bug#72916
  * Update code to atomically replace a file to be more modular

    detailed actions. This makes the postinst output simpler.
  * Abort on errors in the postinst
  * Update texts in postinst to better explain what we are doing

 -- Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Oct 2000 23:58:59 +0200

base-passwd (3.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove qmail accounts, but mark them as special in update-passwd so
    we don't automatically remove them
  * Reserve uids 64010-64016 and gid 64010 for qmail
  * Update README to reflect that we don't always reserve uid&gid pairs

base-passwd (3.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.1.1 (nicely in sync with our own version :)
  * Add missing fallback-return for scan_users
  * Index special users by id instead of name so we can handle strangely
    named entries (like proftp'd anonftp or root-aliases) 
  * Update the README

  * autoconfed the source so we can detect systems without putgrent()
    and provide use our own implementation of putgrent

    cases for root and ftp and keep the homedirectory for www-data.

 -- Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Nov 1999 15:59:34 +0100

base-passwd (3.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * We no longer need to add the utmp-group manually in the postinst,
    update-passwd will do that for us.
