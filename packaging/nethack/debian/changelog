  * Joshua Kwan <joshk@triplehelix.org>:
    - More build system cleanups.
    - Remove x11/Makefile.src, missed last time.
    - Remove old warnings and caveats in README.Debian that are obsoleted
      with 18_overridewin.dpatch. (i.e., stick windowtype:tty into your
      $NETHACKOPTIONS if you intend to set it)
    - Applied a really great debian/rules simplification from
      Aaron Lehmann <aaronl@vitelus.com>
    - 13_simple_mail.dpatch: allow our nethack patches to function
      with dgamelaunch (not in the Debian archive -- yet). Does not
      affect gameplay.
    - Delete nh10.pcf.*, somehow during one build nh10.pcf.gz snuck in.

      Was actually in CVS but not applied to the uploaded source.
    - Lose t32-1024.xpm because it belongs to jnethack and doesn't work
      with gnomehack.
    - Clean up the build system by removing redundant Makefile.src's.
      + 05_build_cflags.dpatch replaced by 05_makefile_logic.dpatch;
        thanks Aaron Lehmann <aaronl@vitelus.com>

      + Bustling Town level generation may cause weird store 'entering'
        announcements and inaccessible stairs (closes: #216386)

    - Use perror() and change some wording in recover.c to make error
      messages useful. (Closes: #72582)
    - Set 'ignintr' in the GNOME default nethackrc to work around GNOME
      library bug #216454. Will not close until the bug is resolved in a
      non-hackish way.
    - As per discussion on debian-devel, turn off number_pad by default
      so as not to deviate from upstream.
    - 16_pixmapdir.dpatch: move all pixmaps into /usr/share/pixmaps/nethack/
      and make all graphical nethacks work with this
    - Keep logfile, record, and perm when backing up old save games,
      because they are backwards-compatible with older versions.
      (Closes: #141843)
    - Remove the redundant 'Drop Many' entry from the GNOME Action menu.
      (Closes: #154750)
    - Use dpkg-statoverride(1) for storing recover setgid information if
      enabled.
    - Add French Debconf template translation by Nicolas Bertolissio
      <nico.bertol@free.fr>. (Closes: #218729)
    - Document QT_FONTSIZE, QT_TILEWIDTH, QT_TILEHEIGHT in Qt nethackrc
      (Closes: #141245)
    - Remove the old /etc/init.d/nethack and its symlinks with a manual
      call to update-rc.d on postinst, due to a sneaky name change that
      crept in during 3.4.2 package work. (Closes: #223496)
    - Fix a few warnings in patches.
    - Make sure nethack-common and all the FE packages always have the
      same version using ${Source-Version} dependencies both ways.

      copyright file.
    - Really include LISP windowing system patch from 0.9.2 upstream.
      (Closes: #215899)
    - Add 07_explore_mode_save.dpatch to use correct temporary 
      buffer in sys/unix/unixmain.c when munging save file in 
      explore mode. (Closes: #203229)
  * Joshua Kwan <joshk@triplehelix.org>:
    - Add 92_enh_paranoid_hit.dpatch to force user to say 'yes' when
      asked to hit a peaceful monster; disabled by default, in-game
      option. (Closes: #62361)

nethack (3.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NetHack is now comaintained by Ben Gertzfield and Joshua Kwan.

      which closes: #184855
  * Acknowledge NMUs/patches, thanks all around to:

      - Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org> (Closes: #184173, #180215)
  * Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>:
    - Merge LISP window system patch into dpatch patches.
    - Merge LISP window system copyright into main copyright file.

    - Update 12_lisp_windowing.dpatch to upstream nethack_el-0.9.2.tar.gz.
    - Add Joshua Kwan to uploaders list for co-maintainership.
  * Joshua Kwan <joshk@triplehelix.org>:
    - Fix FTBFS caused by 'Invisible' being a youprop.h #define
      and used in a QListViewIterator enumerated type. (Closes: #213874)
    - Fix char signedness issue in gnbind.c (Closes: #170531)
    - Build nethack dummy package in binary-indep target. (Closes: #186619)
    - Steal t32-1024.xpm from jnethack - it's missing from NetHack upstream.
      This allows nethack-gnome to use the larger tileset. (Closes: #140398)
    - Now using dh_installinit; use defaults, so we don't go to
      /etc/rcS.d and start before NIS. (Closes: #164132)
    - No clue how this is meant to help, but it doesn't break anything,
      so let's wrap all our menu stuff in sh -c '' and see what happens.
      (Closes: #168385, #168386, #152232)
    - Allow the administrator to decide whether recover should be setgid
      games. (Closes: #148983)
    - Add a menu item to GNOME menu for readying/quivering. (Closes: #154627)
    - Also fix many qt_win.{cpp,h} warnings.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.1.0:
      o Use our own CFLAGS, this allows us to use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt
      o Use /var/mail instead of /var/spool/mail (although both worked as
        the two are still symlinked to each other)
      o Question about old savegame backup becomes a debconf question,
        and moved meat of the logic into postinst
    - Use debian/compat instead of DH_COMPAT, bump it to V4.
    - Use 'ln -sf' and 'gzip -f' so that multiple calls of binary-arch
      work without cleaning.
    - Fixed upstream URL to one that works
    - Fix clean target so that pristine config.h is restored upon clean
    - Removed redundant call to update-rc.d.
    - Compress the nethack-common changelog.Debian.
    - Migrate source modifications to dpatch patches and build-depend on
      dpatch.
    - Consolidate massive amounts of nearly duplicate config.hs into one
      common configuration patch for include/config.h and add additional
      -Ds to CFLAGS for each build.
    - Add some enhancement patches (Save/bones are NOT affected):
        + 90_enh_hpmon.dpatch: HP monitor which visually alerts you when
          HP goes below 2/3, 1/3, and 1/10 of total.
        + 91_enh_menucolors.dpatch: Enables you to specify regular
          expressions to highlight in your inventory (for example,
          cursed/uncursed/blessed items.)

    (custom to Debian) in nethack manpage. (Closes: #153738)
  * Okay, okay, I made a nethack-console package that has no
    dependancies on any X11 libs or other big packages. 
    (Closes: #140303, #142018)
  * Move dependancy on xbase-clients to nethack-x11.  It's the only
    one that needs font making.
  * Note: We define __USE_GNU in sys/unixres.c; looks like the
    constant RTLD_NEXT is only defined if __USE_GNU is defined.
  * Use Guidebook.txt for docs.  For some reason, plain 'Guidebook'
    is full of garbage now after 'make Guidebook'.

nethack (3.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change DEFAULT_WINDOW_SYS to "tty" unconditionally for all
    GUI frontends.  This fixes the case where a user sets
    NETHACKOPTIONS to customize just the dog/cat name or what have you,
    but doesn't set a windowtype:tty flag.  Then, the /usr/bin/nethack
    script will not touch NETHACKOPTIONS, and it will give a strange
    error when it starts up the Qt/Gnome version if X is unavailable.
    (Closes: #142055)
  * Patch unixconf.h to use /usr/bin/mail instead of /bin/mail.
    (Closes: #142000)
  * Fix nethackrc.qt -> .nethackrc.qt typo in README.Debian.
    (Closes: #141244)
  * Not defining SCORE_ON_BOTL for the time being -- it introduces
    a save-game file incompatibility, so I will do that for the next
    upstream release.

nethack (3.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Fix recover to use VAR_PLAYGROUND, not HACKDIR. (Closes: #140701)
  * Fix menu entries.  Now nethack-common has the /usr/games/nethack
    entry (assumed to be text; if the user overrides it, they can
    override the menu entry too), nethack-x11 has /usr/games/xnethack,
    etc. etc. (Closes: #140704)
  * Fix a security bug in recover; other users could "recover"
    save games belonging to users besides themselves.  However,
    they could not load the generated save file unless they could
    also change their UID, as the save file name is always ###playername,
    where ### is the UID allowed to open saved game.
  * Now, recover will only "recover" crash files belonging to the
    same user (or any user, if run by root).  Also, it chowns the
    resultant save file to the original owner of the crash files.
    (Closes: #104247)
  * Add hints "Roguelike,Maze,Dungeon" to menu entries Just For Fun.

  * Split into nethack-common, nethack-x11, nethack-gnome, nethack-qt
    packages. (See README.Debian for details.)

  * nethack package is now a dummy package that depends on nethack-common
    and nethack-x11 for backwards compatibility.
  * /usr/games/nethack now managed by update-alternatives; can be
    set to either tty or graphical version.
  * Save files changed format again; prompt to back up and wipe
    /var/games/nethack and/or /var/lib/games/nethack on upgrade.
  * Use dh_installman instead of dh_installmanpages.
  * Use dh_installxfonts to register X fonts, etc.
  * Install dlb utility in /usr/lib/games/nethack. (Closes: #129741)
  * Make sure NetHack.tile_file is not commented out in app-defaults
    file. (Closes: #119673)
  * config files moved to /etc/nethack/nethackrc.* for various
    windowing types.  Config files in ~/.nethackrc.* now supported
    per-windowing type.  (HACKOPTIONS still overrides them, though.)
  * Fixed numpad issue many moons ago in xterm: (Closes: #52744)
  * Unable to reproduce old ?a ?b bug in xnethack. (Closes: #86959)
  * (Oops, typo when fixed manpage in last version.) (Closes: #111097)
  * desparate -> desperate in package description (Closes: #125180)
  * Using --prefix for tempfile now. (Closes: #54586)
  * Shipping with NetHack*autofocus: False in X11 application-defaults
    file to work around odd Xaw bugs that pop up now and again; the
    patch supplied in #94298 no longer applies to 3.4.0, but the
    crashes still show up with NetHack*autofocus: True once in
    a while.

  * Sorry for being out of touch for a while. I'm back in business
    now that I'm settled down in Tokyo, and have my own desktop computer
    again.
  * Work-around for Xt-related segfaults. May be fixed upstream in
    next release. (Closes: #94298)
  * Use upstream NetHack application-defaults file, and merge in changes
    from upstream nethack.rc for X11 with our customized Debian one.
    (Closes: #95533)
  * Check for existence of old /var/lib/games/nethack dir before
    warning about its possible existence (covers when a user installs
    a pre 3.3.1-5 nethack, purges it, then installs a newer one).
    (Closes: #95536)

    from /var/lib/games/nethack -> /var/games/nethack.
    Do so carefully, then remove the old directory. (Closes: #92501)
  * postrm/preinst still had old dir in there. Oops. 
    So did /etc/init.d/nethack..  I'm very embarassed. Fixed.
  * The preinst does still look in /var/lib/games/nethack for
    pre-3.3.1 versions to archive them.

nethack (3.3.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix FHS bug (/var/lib/games -> /var/games). (Closes: #92501)
  * Just a note, I'm not working on building gnomehack as of yet,
    because with GTK+ 1.2.9 and later, it's quite useless, since
    nethack has to run set-GID and GTK+ >= 1.2.9 forbids this 
    (with good reason.)
  * A lot of bugs were reassigned from gnomehack to nethack that
    are not nethack bugs.
    - Nethack is in .orig.tar.gz+.diff.gz format. (Closes: #62976)
    - No alsa deps for nethack. (Closes: #56738)
    - The stairs bug mentioned is unreproducable in stock Nethack.
      (Closes: #72202)
    - Menu entry for creating new game bug?  Seems gnome-specific.
      (Closes: #79771)
    - Options dialog bug is gnomehack-specific. (Closes: #64944)
    - Gnomehack used a different recovery script that was broken.
      Not applicable to nethack. (Closes: #69080, #71193)

  * Buh.  Stupid typo in /etc/init.d/nethack; doesn't actually run.
    Fixed.  Also implemented stop|reload|restart|force-reload (which
    do nothing, as this is a rcS.d-only script) for policy reasons.
  * Lintian fix: make symlink for license file relative.
  * Lintian fix: don't use menu icon "none".

  * Fixed LOGDIR typo long ago. (Closes: #65486)

  * Wow. I don't have to build with special patches any more; just
    about *everything* was accepted upstream. Go DevTeam! You guys
    rule. :) (One thing I noticed wasn't patched upstream was
    disabling IBMgraphics on the Rogue level. If people still notice
    problems, let me know; the historic problems with IBMgraphics

nethack (3.3.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

    Nethack players at once' hack.
  * Change /etc/init.d/nethack to work on *any* lock files in
    /var/lib/games/nethack (use *.0 instead of *lock.0)
  * Patch to fix nasty bugs introduced by separating lock/savefiles
    into /var/lib/games/nethack. (Forgot some /s to a few sprintfs,
    ouch!)
  * Patch to fix recover to work with separate /var/lib/games/nethack

    of /etc/rc.boot/nethack. Fixes: #32441
  * Spoilers split off into separate nethack-spoilers package. (Note:
    spoilers may be out of date now for 3.3.0!)
  * NOTE NOTE NOTE: Save files from 3.2.2 are *NOT COMPATIBLE* with
    3.3.0 so the preinst will prompt the user and archive the old
    save directory, or abort.
  * Now depends on debianutils (>= 1.13) because we use 'tempfile'
    program in the preinst to get a safe filename for archiving
    into for the above NOTE NOTE NOTE. This sucks, though, because
    slink's debianutils is 1.10, but it doesn't support the
    --suffix we need to make a tempfile with .tar.gz as the extension.

    what version we're upgrading from crash. (Fixes: #27101)

  * Enabled tiles by default when running with X enhancements.
  * Created xnethack script to run the X-based nethack.
