@ The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a

@ client and the client-invoked scientific applications depend on. With
@ the number of cores per machine growing, and with scientific apps
@ commonly started for every core, it is essential to have memory
@ shared as much as possible between binaries of all projects.

#Description: screen saver auto-controlling volunteer computing
# The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
# software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
# various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
# desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
# Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
# projects.
# .
# The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
# manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
# available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
# some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
# a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
# with their accustomed priciple for setting and choosing a screen
# saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
# again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
# the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
# the manager.
# .
# This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
# effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
# Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
# it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
# processes running on the same core.

@Description: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
@ The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
@ software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
@ resources.
@ .
@ This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
@ control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
@ overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
@  * attached projects
@  * running tasks
@  * file transfers between the client and project servers
@  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
@  * constraints on CPU usage
@ The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
@ it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
@ in which all information and all control elements are available.
@ .
@ For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
@ boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
@ machine contributing.
