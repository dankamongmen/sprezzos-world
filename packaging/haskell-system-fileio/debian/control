Description: consistent filesystem interaction across GHC versions
 This is a small wrapper around the "directory", "unix", and "Win32"
 packages, for use with "system-filepath". It provides a consistent
 API to the various versions of these packages distributed with
 different versions of GHC.
 .
 In particular, this library supports working with POSIX files that
 have paths which can't be decoded in the current locale encoding.
 .
 This package contains the normal library files.
