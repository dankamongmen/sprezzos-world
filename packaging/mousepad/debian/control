Description: simple Xfce oriented text editor
 Mousepad is a graphical text editor for Xfce based on Leafpad.
 .
 The initial reason for Mousepad was to provide printing support, which would
 have been difficult for Leafpad for various reasons.
 .
 Although some features are under development, currently Mousepad has the
 following features:
   * Complete support for UTF-8 text
   * Cut/Copy/Paste and Select All text
   * Search and Replace
   * Font selection
   * Word Wrap
   * Character coding selection
   * Auto character coding detection (UTF-8 and some code-sets)
   * Manual code-set setting
   * Infinite Undo/Redo by word
   * Auto Indent
   * Multi-line Indent
   * Display line numbers
   * Drag and Drop
   * Printing
