libmikmod (3.1.12-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge the NMU, thanks Simon!
  * Make the nosound driver have higher priority than the disk
    writers. (Closes: #690943)
  * Demote the pulseaudio-esound-compat | oss-compat recommendation to
    Suggests, now that the fallback is not the disk writer.
    (Closes: #696013)
  * Build with hardening=-fortify, as enabling fortification breaks the
    driver loading.

libmikmod (3.1.12-4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Apply patches from Hans de Goede and Pantelis Koukousoulas to enable
    the ESD driver, so we can interoperate with PulseAudio (Closes: #385844)
  * Recommend pulseaudio-esound-compat | oss-compat because if we don't have
    one of those, the fallback path is to write output to ./music.raw, which
    is unlikely to be what you want!

libmikmod (3.1.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop the dependency on oss-compat. Programs that use libmikmod should
    recommend it instead. (Closes: #647686)

libmikmod (3.1.11-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer  (Closes: #628162).
  * Updated to use short-form dh(7).
  * Switch to format: 3.0 (quilt).
  * Use dh-autoreconf to freshen the autotools stuff. (Closes: #536000)
  * Add lintian overrides (with comments), to silence false alarms.
  * Include the upstream README under /usr/share/doc/libmikmod2, as this
    is where driver options are documented. (Closes: #423027)
  * Disable the esd driver. (Closes: #123150)
  * Depend on oss-compat, to be able to assume an OSS compatible /dev/dsp.
    (Closes: #385844). This is done on Linux too, because the ALSA driver
    is broken too.

  * Applied upstream patch 3.1.11-a which fixes automake warnings and
    ought to fix amd64 arch.
  * Also modified debian/rules to add the -a to the binary packages
    only, so no new .tar.gz is required.
  * Added some more checks for amd64 arch, thanks to Hans-Frieder Vogt
    to point it out.
  * Added missing build-dep on texinfo, since the upstream patch touches
    mikmod.texi and triggers a rebuild of mikmod.info.

 -- Ingo Saitz <ingo@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Jul 2004 14:59:28 +0200

libmikmod (3.1.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

    it also overoptimizes the test programm which really should not link in
    that case (Closes: #128779).

    use libmikmod without running devfsd (Closes: #106168).

    not support ALSA 0.5 currently (this caused the above bug to happen)
  * Changed configure to check for /dev/dsp instead /dev/sndstat for OSS
    presence. Fixes building on 2.4 kernels/ALSA with OSS emulation enabled:
    debian/patches/configure_oss.patch

    (Closes: #84051)
