fltk1.1 (1.1.10-14) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules:
    - Keep hardening flags out of the installed fltk-config by adding an
      extra configure run with them disabled and using the resulting
      fltk-config.  (See #677705.)
    - Explicitly use hardened CPPFLAGS.

    - Pass hardened LDFLAGS to configure as DSOFLAGS too.  (Closes: #663278.)
    - Enable full hardening.

    source patches from NMUs will wind up in separate files.
  * src/Makefile: substitute -fPIC for -fPIE in C(XX)FLAGS.
  * test/Makefile: link the threads demo with LDFLAGS, not CXXFLAGS!

fltk1.1 (1.1.10-9) unstable; urgency=low

fltk1.1 (1.1.10-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Make libfltk1.1-dbg Multi-Arch: same, as it will only cover libraries;
      eliminate a stray newline in its description.
    - Drop fluid, which the fltk1.3 source package is taking over.

  * debian/rules:
    - Stop installing any fluid-related files.
    - Don't bother keeping debugging symbols for games.

fltk1.1 (1.1.10-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Revert overzealous Multi-Arch: same setting for libfltk1.1-dbg, which
      also ships debugging symbols for executables in non-multiarch paths.
    - Prepare for the libjpeg 8 transition by build-depending on, and
      having libfltk1.1-dev suggest, the virtual libjpeg-dev package.
  * debian/changelog: Correct Danish translator's name in previous entry.

fltk1.1 (1.1.10-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build for multiarch, both on principle and per historical interest
    (as demonstrated by ia32-libs bug #441406):
    - debian/compat: Advance to 9.
    - debian/control: Advance build dependency on debhelper to (>= 8.1.3).
      Add Multi-Arch: same and Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends} for libfltk1.1,
      Multi-Arch: same for libfltk1.1-dbg, and Multi-Arch: foreign for fluid.
    - debian/libfltk1.1(-dev).install: Match multi-arch paths.
    - debian/rules: Pass a multi-arch libdir to configure, and substitute it
      in FLTKConfig.cmake (which however remains in /usr/lib/fltk for now).
    - debian/FLTKConfig.cmake: Rename to FLTKConfig.cmake.in and
      un-hardcode the library directory.
  * debian/po/da.po: Add, thanks to Joe Dalton.  (Closes: #621359.)
  * debian/fltk1.1.symbols: Add symbols introduced by GCC 4.5 or 4.6, but
    mark them as optional for the sake of architectures (ia64, sparc)
    that still default to 4.4.
  * debian/control: Standards-Version: 3.9.2.  (No changes needed.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libfltk1.1.symbols: tag one symbol emitted *only* by GCC 4.3.x
    and 4.4.x (but not 4.5.x or up) as optional.  (Closes: #609245.)
  * debian/compat: advance to 8, as it is safe to do so.
  * debian/control:
    - Advance debhelper requirement to (>= 8) per the above.
    - Advance dpkg-dev requirement to (>= 1.15.7) for dpkg-buildflags.
    - Generally clean up relationships; don't worry about anything pre-etch,
      and wildcard the build-dep on libasound2-dev to [linux-any].
    - Set Vcs-* fields to point to (new) personal git.d.o repository.
    - Declare compatibility with Policy version 3.9.1.
  * debian/rules:
    - Obtain baseline {C,CXX,LD}FLAGS from dpkg-buildflags rather than
      relying on them to be in the environment courtesy of dpkg-buildpackage.
    - Stop passing -D_REENTRANT, which is not only obsolete but redundant.
  * debian/source/{format,options,patch-header}: advance to 3.0 (quilt),
    albeit in single-debian-patch mode per VCS use, for .orig.tar.bz2 support.
  * fluid/fluid.desktop: replace the Exec command (which used cd) with a Perl
    one-liner for compatibility with more desktop environments. (LP: #569518.)
  * debian/fluid.lintian-overrides: adjust accordingly.
  * fltk-config.in: strip -[gO]* from --c(xx)flags output. (LP: #606032.)
  * (debian/).gitignore: Direct git to ignore content generated during build.

fltk1.1 (1.1.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/Makefile: link libfltk.so.1.1 against -lpthread, as fluid now
    otherwise fails to link on the Hurd (with complaints that libfltk.so.1
    contains undefined references to pthread_mutexattr_*).
  * debian/source.lintian-overrides: retire per Lintian 2.3.1.  (See #553264.)

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Wed, 06 Jan 2010 22:05:04 -0500

fltk1.1 (1.1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * {fluid,test}/Makefile: link against all directly referenced libraries,
    even if they are also indirect dependencies, to fix build errors with
    binutils-gold, which defaults to --no-add-needed.  (Closes: #554365.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.10~rc2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/FLTKConfig.cmake: belatedly advance FLTK_VERSION_PATCH to 10.
  * debian/{fluid,source}.lintian-overrides: override spurious Lintian
    diagnostics; fluid.desktop's command is legitimate, as is the
    artificial debian/CMakeCache.txt discussed in #553264.

fltk1.1 (1.1.10~rc2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libfltk1.1.symbols: prepare for the GCC 4.4 transition by

    as optional.  (Closes: #551612; LP: #455418.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.10~rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate.
  * debian/copyright: extend date range through 2009.
  * fluid/*: revert i18n patch (#333401); although I still support the
    general idea, it proved problematic in practice.  (Translated strings
    weren't always properly isolated to the GUI, and the only translation
    wasn't actively maintained anyway.)
  * debian/fluid.install: update accordingly.  (No more fluid.mo.)
  * Update Spanish Debconf translation, thanks to Franciso Javier Cuadrado.
    (Closes: #513692.)  Apologies for the delay; the submission was slightly
    late for lenny, and as such no longer merited an upload on its own.
  * debian/control:
    - List ${misc:Depends} in Depends across the board, as future Debhelper
      versions could conceivably generate content for it.
    - Clean up Section fields: libfltk1.1 is already implicitly in libs, and
      libfltk1.1-dbg is in the newfangled debug section nowadays. ;-)
    - Advance Standards-Version to 3.8.3.  (No further changes required.)
    - Require debhelper (>= 7.0.50) for further rules simplification.
  * debian/rules:
    - On alpha, lock in a version of 1.1.10~rc2 for symbols introduced when
      building with GCC 4.3, which is now the default on that platform too.
    - Simplify further per debhelper 7.0.50+'s override_dh_* support.

fltk1.1 (1.1.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian still defaults to GCC 4.2 on alpha at present (2008-06-11);
    strip symbols introduced when building with 4.3 regardless of actual
    compiler version so that when the transition occurs, the generated
    dependencies will be suitably tight.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jun 2008 18:12:25 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fl_Choice's post-1.1.7 policy of insisting on a white background in
    the default scheme doesn't work so well when the user has requested a
    white (or nearly white) foreground; revert to honoring the user's
    background choice as well in such cases.  (Closes: #484660.)
  * Update symbols file, as building with GCC 4.3 appears to have
    introduced a handful of new symbols.
  * Declare compliance with Policy 3.8.0.  (No changes required.)

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:12:09 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

fltk1.1 (1.1.9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release after all, with bug fixes that didn't quite
    manage to make 1.1.8.
  * Migrate from CDBS to Debhelper 7, adding a build dependency on
    dpkg-dev (>= 1.14.17) for baseline CFLAGS determination.

fltk1.1 (1.1.8~rc3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate.
  * Drop debian/rules logic to fix games' .desktop Categories, which

    FindFLTK.cmake's expectations.  (Closes: #437967.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.8~rc2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Restore single-line fltk-config --libs output for compatibility with
    callers that expected such, even though they probably meant to use
    --ld(static)flags anyway.  (Closes: #470327.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.8~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reformat copyright file slightly to ensure legal validity (per Lintian).
  * Readjust fltk1.1-doc's doc-base section to Programming/C++ per
    doc-base 0.8.10.
  * Add a libfltk1.1.symbols file to permit looser reverse dependencies in
    many cases.
  * Formally move to Debhelper 6, bumping the cdbs requirement to 0.4.51
    to avoid #462130.
  * Update watch file to handle release candidates correctly.

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream fix (to be included in 1.1.8 if and when it ever
    materializes) for "fluid -c"'s inappropriate X usage when generating
    code for Fl_Help_View widgets.  (Closes: #455232.)
  * Adjust shared library linkage per dpkg-shlibdeps's new warnings.  The
    only remaining warnings concern libm, which g++ pulls in even when not
    explicitly asked to.
  * Belatedly modernize fltk1.1-doc's doc-base section (Apps -> Applications).
  * Declare compliance with Policy 3.7.3.
  * Debconf templates and debian/control reviewed by the debian-l10n-
    english team as part of the Smith review project.  (Closes: #452494.)
  [Debconf translation updates]

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turn fl_xfont into a smart pointer capable of on-demand
    (re)initialization so that future releases with improved core-font
    selection logic need not run it on every single font change.
  * Correct debian/watch.  (Closes: #449636.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship binaries of the example games, with ALSA enabled on Linux, in a
    new fltk1.1-games package.  (NB: although upstream's names for the
    games do not appear to conflict with anything currently in Debian,
    they are sufficiently generic that the Debian packages err on the side
    of caution by prepending fl.)
  * Further streamline all executables' shared-library dependencies.
  * Move .desktop files to /usr/share/applications, as /usr/share/applnk
    is deprecated and KDE-only.  (Closes: #444063)
  * Run dh_icons for fluid and fltk1.1-games, also per #444063.
  * Modernize games' .desktop files' Categories settings as well.
  * Drop gratuitous (and typo-ridden) DEB_DH_SHLIBDEPS_ARGS setting.
  * fltk-config(.in) --compile: link FLTK dynamically.  (Closes: #441141.)
  * Declare home page centrally (per dpkg 1.14.6) rather than in descriptions.
  * Accommodate the (atypical) possibility of multi-word CC and CXX settings.
  * Declare those inter-package dependencies that need to be tight with
    ${binary:Version} rather than the deprecated ${Source-Version}.
  * Modernize fluid's Debian menu section (Apps -> Applications).
  * Expand debian/copyright; in particular, clarify that licensees have
    the option of applying newer LGPL versions (than v2.0).
  * Drop old workaround for #365085 in favor of simply requiring a new
    enough cdbs.

    patch; inaugurate libfltk1.1-dev's NEWS.Debian with a suitable entry.
    (Closes: #405233.)
  * debian/po/es.po: new Spanish translation for libfltk1.1-dev, courtesy

  * Merge in more fixes from the 1.1 branch, whose likelihood of seeing
    another upstream release is highly uncertain; bump shlibs requirement
    because these add two new public methods.
  * (Build-)depend directly on libgl(u)1-mesa-dev by default (but keep
    the alternate [build-]dependencies on virtual packages, of course).
  * Install fluid-32.xpm, and use it as fluid's menu icon.
  * Move up to debhelper compatibility level 5, and make use of cdbs
    0.4.37's automatic -dbg package handling.

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; among many other things:
    - Fixes nonsensical sentence in documentation.  (Closes: #341747.)
    - Documents new foreground()/background() paradigm.  (Closes: #343550.)
  * Enable (newly added) Xinerama support and add an appropriate build
    dependency.
  * Build with the default GCC version on all architectures, as g++-4.0 no
    longer suffers from bug #336463 as of revision 4.0.2-4.  (Closes: #342965.)
  * Generally resynch and tidy up debian/rules.
  * Rework installation slightly, and install fluid's new .desktop files.
  * Update version info in pregenerated FLTKConfig.cmake, and stop shipping
    a redundant copy of FLTKUse.cmake now that it's materialized upstream.
  * Extend fluid's internationalization to the two new fluid-generated
    modules (print_panel and template_panel) and attempt (rather
    conservatively, as I know extremely little Spanish) to bring its
    Spanish translation up to date.  Further assistance, and for that
    matter a Spanish Debconf translation, would be appreciated.
  * Resynch with upstream SVN as of Jan. 31, which just adds some belated
    bugfixes.
  * Make fltk-config(.in) list indirect dependencies only for
    --ldstaticflags (vs. --ldflags), and accordingly downgrade most of
    libfltk1.1-dev's dependencies to suggestions.

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: drop long-obsolete alternate (build-)dependencies on
    ancient versions of xlibs-dev.
  * debian/po/*: force an update to ensure a proper Report-Msgid-Bugs-To field.
  * debian/po/sv.po: new Swedish translation, thanks to Daniel Nylander
    <po@danielnylander.se>.  (Closes: #331473.)
  * BTW, libfltk1.1-dev's merged templates file should now be encoded in
    UTF-8 throughout rather than in a hodgepodge of national encodings.

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Clean up build-dependencies now that the dust from the libglu1c2
    fiasco has settled.
  * Give Fl_Check_Browser an appropriate destructor to keep it from
    leaking memory.  (Closes: #321285, but affected programs may need to
    be recompiled to get the fix.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/po/vi.po: add a Vietnamese translation, thanks to Clytie
    Siddall <clytie@riverland.net.au>.  (Closes: #314172.)
  * debian/*: C++ transition.  (Closes: #317539.)
    - libfltk1.1c102 renamed back to libfltk1.1, as no package by that
      name ever appeared in a release; redundant conflicts dropped.
    - Make sure to use a post-transition libglu1c2 such as libglu1-xorg.
  * debian/control: standards-version 3.6.2 (already compliant).

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Jul 2005 17:36:12 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Revert previous change, which seems to have been ineffective for some
    reason, in favor of commenting out the problematic Makefile rule
    altogether.  (Closes: #310151.)
  * debian/control: Go back to specifying the URL as part of the
    description rather than via a non-standard field that doesn't seem to
    have caught on.  (Closes: #310240.)

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules: touch configure to avoid trying to run autoconf as part
    of the build.  (This got lost when converting to CDBS years ago; I
    don't know why it didn't bite any of the many intervening releases.)

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Fri, 20 May 2005 17:40:16 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-3) unstable; urgency=medium

fltk1.1 (1.1.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * test/*.cxx: Apply patch from Andreas Jochens <aj@andaco.de> to fix
    bogus pointer->int casts, which GCC 4.0 rightly treats as errors on
    64-bit systems.  (Closes: #284168.)

  * debian/po/pt_BR.po: add a Brazilian Portuguese Debconf translation,
    thanks to Tiago Bortoletto Vaz <tiagovaz@im.ufba.br> (Closes: #281459.)
  * src/fl_font_xft.cxx: kludge in support for using the Xlib code in
    fl_font_x.cxx as a fallback, for instance to work around bugs such as
    #277602 and #281203.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Nov 2004 10:44:06 -0500

fltk1.1 (1.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release; Debian patches merged forward as usual.

    - stop setting DEB_MAKE_INSTALL_TARGET now that upstream supports DESTDIR.
    - resync OPTIM setting with configure(.ac).

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Oct 2004 22:30:05 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.4+1.1.5rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate; Debian patches merged forward as usual.
  * debian/watch: new, in hopes of making DEHS somewhat happier; only
    marginally useful due to lack of support for release candidates, though.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Jul 2004 21:12:39 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.4+1.1.5rc1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Make libfltk1.1-dev's description slightly more detailed.
  * debian/libfltk1.1-dev.config: determine header-links's default by
    inspecting /usr/include/FL.
  * debian/libfltk1.1-dev.postrm: remove gratuitous and potentially
    fragile use of debconf.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Jul 2004 21:08:49 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.4+1.1.5rc1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/{control,rules}: add a (new-style) libfltk1.1c102-dbg package.
  * New Debconf translations (debian/po/*.po):
    - nl [Dutch] by Luk Claes <luk.claes@ugent.be>.  (Closes: #251243.)
    - de [German] by Erik Schanze <mail@erikschanze.de>.  (Closes: #252724.)

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Jun 2004 19:35:37 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.4+1.1.5rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate, incorporating the fix for #226014.
    Remaining patches ported forward (usually trivially).
  * FL/Makefile.in: revert changes (now handled more cleanly).
  * debian/libfltk1.1-dev.links: new, for the two header-related links we
    actually want.
  * debian/rules:
    - don't let CDBS pass CFLAGS to configure; FLTK's build system is
      somewhat idiosyncratic and prefers such settings in OPTIM.
    - take advantage of configure's new --without-links option.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Apr 2004 21:55:19 -0400

  * Urgency medium due to fix for FTBFS.
  * aclocal.m4: Supply Jurij Smakov's AC_PATH_X_CORRECTED et al. from
    #233969, since FLTK does not use Xt.
  * configure(.in): Use it.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Mar 2004 19:48:07 -0500

fltk1.1 (1.1.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

    rules, not changelog!)
  * debian/control:
    - adjust X (build-)dependencies per 4.3 reorg.
    - add libz-dev and libgl(u)-dev as alternatives for the relevant packages.
    - rework descriptions.
  * debian/menu: quote all values, restoring Lintian cleanliness.

fltk1.1 (1.1.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Feb 2004 09:54:11 -0500

fltk1.1 (1.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - (Build-)depend on libxft-dev (>> 2.1.2) rather than libxft2-dev,
      which is now just a virtual alias.  (Closes: #227309.)
    - Bump build-dependency on debhelper to 4.1.46 per cdbs's advice.
  * debian/copyright: spell everything out as required.
  * debian/rules: install CREDITS per above.
  * documentation/intro.html: remove links to dead mirrors.  (Closes: #216039.)
  * src/Fl_Preferences.cxx: don't bother calling makePathForFile until we
    actually want to write something.  (Closes: #226014.)

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jan 2004 18:17:33 -0500

fltk1.1 (1.1.3+1.1.4rc2-2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Wed, 30 Jul 2003 14:32:56 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.3+1.1.4rc1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libfltk1.1-dev.config: increase priority of question to medium,
    since it seems to be more controversial than anticipated.  (See #196003)
  * debian/rules: clear DEB_MAKE_CHECK_TARGET to avoid breaking with
    cdbs >= 0.4.3.
  * src/fl_font_xft.cxx: make sure to set fl_xfont to something valid,
    albeit not generally the actual requested font, in fl_font().  

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Jun 2003 12:41:36 -0400

fltk1.1 (1.1.3+1.1.4rc1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

fltk1.1 (1.1.3+1.1.4rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (1.1.4 release candidate 1).
  * FL/Makefile.in, debian/libfltk1.1-dev.{config,postinst,postrm,templates}:
    make deprecated *.h headers optional, via Debconf.  (Closes: #179503)
  * Makefile, makeinclude.in: revert DESTDIR hack.
  * configure: regenerate with Autoconf 2.57 rather than 2.13, since
    upstream uses 2.53 and the diff ends up much smaller.
  * debian/control: bump cdbs build-dep to >= 0.2.8.
  * debian/rules:
    - make sure to build libfltk1.1c102's shlibs file before calculating
      fluid's dependencies.
    - set DEB_MAKE_INSTALL_TARGET per cdbs 0.2.8.
    - set version in shlibs file automatically again.
  * debian/rules.manual: retire.
  * src/fl_font_xft.cxx:
    - upstream's fix for gl_font() is Xft1-specific; substitute a much
      cruder version that at least keeps it from segfaulting.
