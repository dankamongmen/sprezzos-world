  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Stop shipping bssh and bvnc; these are meant as examples, but would
    require a replace if libavahi-ui would change SONAME; also these show up
    in the menus while we have nicer alternatives now (e.g. vinagre); finally
    these require additional deps which wouldn't be fit for libavahi-ui (bvnc
    requires xvncviewer); see also Launchpad #194749; closes: #461693.
  * Add armel to architecture list; closes: #469854.
