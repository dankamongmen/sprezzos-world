xft (2.1.10-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Remove that explicit shlibs file added in the last upload. The only
    symbols that are hidden are private, so if your app is using those symbols
    it's being very naughty. Go back to just generating shlibs using
    dh_makeshlibs.

    idempotency fix.
  * Fix changelog to not make lintian upset.

    a .pc file.  Make the dep on libx11-dev versioned so that we're sure
    to have an xproto.pc file (from xorg 7.0 or higher).

    properly. Thanks Drew Parsons and Steve Langasek. (closes: #363922)
  * Run dh_install with --list-missing
  * Fix package name in rules file so that the debugging symbols go to the
    right place. Thanks Tim Johann. (closes: #365341)
  * Remove useless instaces of x-dev in dependencies. Thaks Ross Burton.
    (closes: #363507)

xft (2.1.8.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable
  * Move the header files back to /usr/include/X11/Xft to bring them in line
    with X11R7
  * Add versioned pre-depends on x11-common to match X11R7. Do this for all
    packages shipped by this source package.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Mar 2006 22:44:40 -0500

xft (2.1.8.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Actually install the header files to /usr/X11R6/include/Xft. Thanks Steve
    Langasek.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Mar 2006 00:33:46 -0500

xft (2.1.8.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make libxft-dev pre-depend on x11-common so as to make sure that the
    symlink for /usr/include/X11 is already in place when we install the
    package. (closes: #358254, #358260, #350298, #358308)

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Mar 2006 00:06:39 -0500


xft (2.1.8.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include freetype headers in cflags in the xft.pc file. This is an edit to
    001_no_export_freetype.diff. The freetype headers are included in xft's
    headers, so these are necessary. Also, don't use variables in the .pc file
    that haven't been defined anywhere. Thanks to Roger Leigh, Decklin Foster,
    Eric Dorland, and Steve Langasek (who wrote the patch). (closes: #350458)

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Feb 2006 12:59:29 -0500

xft (2.1.8.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add 002_no_xproto_dep.diff so that the .pc file doesn't depend on xproto,
    which doesn't yet have a .pc file in Debian (to be removed when 7.0 enters
    the archive). Thanks Mike Hommey. (closes: #349678)
  * Include patch from Steve Langasek in full from previous upload. This
    should work around the issue properly. (closes: #349318)

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Jan 2006 21:52:01 -0500

xft (2.1.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add build-dep on quilt
  * Add 001_no_export_freetype.diff. This is a modified patch from Steve
    Langasek that causes xft.pc not to export freetype or xrender as part of
    the interface, but hide them in Requires.private instead (closes: #349318)
  * Remove versioned build-deps on libx11 and libxrender.
  * Move preinst to preinst.in so it doesn't get deleted by clean target. We
    really need a better way to deal with these things...

xft (2.1.7-1ubuntu2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add Pre-Depends on x-common to libxft-dev, so its files don't get caught
    in /usr/X11R6 thanks to symlink treachery.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 May 2005 00:48:57 +1000

xft (2.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Keith Packard attests, and Branden Robinson verified as far as he is
      able, that no interface changes have been made since 2.1.2.
    + Highlights of upstream changes:
      - Change FC_CHARCELL and FC_MONO interpretation.  FC_MONO no longer
        clips glyphs to charcell, you must specify FC_CHARCELL for that.
      - Add support for FT_GlyphSlot_Embolden where it exists (which it
        usually doesn't).
      - Avoid crashing when using FT_Face objects.
      - Deal with broken FreeType 2.1.7 BDF/PCF loaders by trying both
        y_ppem/x_ppem and width/height values.
      - Work with older versions of Fontconfig by using various pattern
        elements only when defined.
      - Change Freetype includes to new syntax.
      - Search for nearest bitmap for bitmap-only fonts.
      - Support fontconfig 2.2 release which doesn't include FC_HINT_STYLE.

  * Update Debian copyright file with URL to new tar archive, and identify
    Keith Packard as the upstream maintainer, not the upstream author
    (upstream now provides an AUTHORS file to clarify the latter).

  * Correct and enhance xft-config's usage message:
    + No non-option arguments are allowed.
    + At least one option argument must be specified.
    + Use ellipsis notation to indicate that more than one option is allowed.
    + Provide one-sentence summary of the command's purpose.
    + Sort option names in lexicographic order.

  * Write and ship manual page for xft-config.

  * Drop libxft2.docs debhelper file; CDBS is now brainy enough to identify
    and tell dh_installdocs to ship a non-empty README file, so libxft2.docs
    has become redundant.

  * Add debian/compat file to declare debhelper version 4 compatibility.

 -- Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org>  Fri,  1 Apr 2005 13:13:48 -0500

xft (2.1.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

    - debian/control:
      + package build-depends on x-dev and libx11-dev instead of xlibs-dev
      + libxrender-dev depends on x-dev and libx11-dev instead of xlibs-dev
      + make libxft-dev conflict with xlibs-dev (<< 4.3.0) due to (now
        undiverted) file overlaps
    - debian/libxft-dev.preinst: remove diversions made by previous versions
      of package if present
    - debian/libxft-dev.postrm: deleted

 -- Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Mar 2004 02:13:15 -0500

xft (2.1.2-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency due to fix for FTBFS problem introduced by new FreeType library.

  * Clean up package's build-dependencies and dependencies.
    - debian/control:
      + Drop versioning of build-dependencies on libxrender-dev and xlibs-dev.
        All officially released versions of these Debian packages are
        sufficient to build this package.
      + Drop package dependencies on debhelper's "${misc:Depends}" construct;
        this package is too simple to need it.
      + Drop versioning of libxft-dev's dependencies on libxrender-dev and
        xlibs-dev.  All officially released versions of these Debian packages
        should be sufficient to objects using this package.
      + Drop libxft-dev's dependency on pkg-config; pkg-config is supported
        but not mandated.

  * Document more functions in the Xft(3) manual page.
    - Xft.3.in

  * Set package maintainer to the Debian X Strike Force and put myself in the
    Uploaders field.
    - debian/control

  * Do not include <freetype/freetype.h> directly; use the macro FT_FREETYPE_H
    to include it instead, as required by freetype 2.1.7 (fixes FTBFS when
    FreeType 2.1.7 is on the system; thanks, Tore Anderson).
    (Closes: #221129)
    - Xft.h

  * Stop passing --x-includes and --x-libraries flags to
    DEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS; AC_PATH_X suffices to locate the X include
    files and libraries.
    - debian/rules

  * Pass --disable-rpath flag to DEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS; consequently, drop
    invocation of chrpath from common-install-arch target.
    - debian/rules
    - debian/control: drop build-dependency on chrpath

  * In the pre-installation script, only remove diversions from old
    libxft2-dev package if that package has those diversions; dpkg-divert will
    barf if you try to remove a nonexistent diversion when a different package
    is diverting the same file.  This enables libxft-dev to be upgraded from
    the previous version, and installed over the same version.

xft (2.1.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set AM_MAINTAINER_MODE because we do not want users of the Debian source
    package to have to have automake installed.
    - configure.ac

  * Run aclocal && automake --foreign && autoconf to resynchronize with
    changes to Makefile.am and configure.ac.
    - Makefile.in
    - aclocal.m4
    - configure

  * Make libxft-dev conflict with and provide libxft2-dev to help apt figure
    out an upgrade path.  Deliberately *not* making libxft-dev replace
    libxft2-dev, even though it would be correct to do so, because doing that
    plays such havoc with dpkg-divert that libxft-dev will fail to install on
    upgrades from libxft2-dev.  This way libxft2-dev will be properly removed
    first.

 -- Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org>  Wed,  8 Oct 2003 18:09:37 -0500

xft (2.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Migrate dpkg diversions from libxft2-dev to libxft-dev, which was
    neglected in the previous release.
    - debian/libxft-dev.preinst:
      + remove all previous diversions created by libxft2-dev on all installs
        and upgrades (libxft-dev's preinst script will not be passed a $2
        corresponding to the most-recently-configured version of libxft2-dev)
      + add diversions using new package name
    - debian/libxft-dev.postrm: remove diversions using new package name

 -- Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Oct 2003 15:02:06 -0500

xft (2.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Take a hatchet to the RPATH that libtool insists on putting into the
    libXft shared object by using chrpath.
    - debian/control: add build-dependency on chrpath
    - debian/rules: add common-install-arch double-colon rule to invoke
      chrpath on the libXft shared object

 -- Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Oct 2003 00:00:13 -0500

xft (2.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version
    - debian/copyright:
      + updated URL of upstream release
      + resync copyright and license notice with upstream

  * Rename source package to "xft" from "xft2".
    - debian/control

  * Rename libxft2-dev package to libxft-dev.  Consequently, drop conflict and
    provide relationship with (formerly virtual) libxft-dev package.
    - debian/control
    - debian/libxft-dev.install: renamed from libxft2-dev.install
    - debian/libxft-dev.postrm: renamed from libxft2-dev.postrm
    - debian/libxft-dev.preinst: renamed from libxft2-dev.preinst

  * Add versioning (>> 4.2.1) to libxft-dev's dependency on xlibs-dev.
    - debian/control

  * Ship upstream README in libxft2's documentation directory.
    - debian/libxft2.docs

  * Correct libxft2-dbg's extended description to mention the correct path
    where the debugging library is installed.
    - debian/control

  * Migrate from CBS to CDBS.
    - debian/control: add build-dependency on cdbs (>= 0.4.12) (thanks to
      Colin Walters for adding debugging package support I can use with a
      clear conscience :) )
    - debian/rules: renamed from debian/rocks and translated to CDBS-speak

 -- Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Oct 2003 20:55:54 -0500

xft2 (2.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure: re-run autoconf to expose the fix to configure.ac from 2.1.1-1
    (thanks, Robert Millan) (Closes: #185536)

  * debian/control:
    - tweak packages' short descriptions
    - make libxft2 depend on ${misc:Depends} so debhelper can do its thing
    - add libxft2-dbg binary package
  * debian/rocks:
    - new rule, deb-makeshlibs-libxft2-dbg, which is a no-op to prevent CBS
      from running dh_makeshlibs on this package
    - new rule, deb-strip-libxft2-dbg, which is a no-op to prevent CBS from
      running dh_strip on this package
  * debian/libxft2-dbg.install: ship the shared object(s) in
    /usr/X11R6/lib/debug/

  * Version the build dependency on xlibs-dev to specify version 4.2.1 or
    later; xft2 will not build successfully with woody-era (4.1.0) versions of
    xlibs-dev.
    - debian/control

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.1; no changes necessary.
    - debian/control

  * Source package build-depends, and libxft2-dev depends, on libxrender-dev
    (>> 0.8.1).
    - debian/control

  * Drop README.Debian file; xft will be separately packaged from XFree86 for
    the forseeable future.
    - debian/README.Debian: deleted

  * Ship libXft.la file in libxft2-dev.
    - debian/libxft2-dev.install

  * Ship library files in /usr/lib instead of /usr/X11R6/lib, and debugging
    library files in /usr/lib/debug instead of /usr/X11R6/lib/debug, per
    policy 11.8.7.  Continuing to ship include files in /usr/X11R6/include/X11
    until upstream default changes.
    - debian/libxft2{,-dbg,-dev}.install

  * Ship Xft.3 manpage (in /usr/share/man/man3, so it does not conflict with
    the XFree86-provided Xft manpage, which is being renamed to Xft1.3x in
    4.3.0 anyway).

  * debian/rocks:
    - drop deb-common-build and deb-extra-clean rules per Colin Walters
    - pass --x-includes and --x-libraries to configure script, since the
      AC_PATH_X autoconf macro is highly suboptimal
    - don't be so crazy about the versioning in the shlibs file (i.e., drop
      Debian package component)
  * debian/libxft2-dev.preinst: sense of the version comparison when removing
    the obsolete diversion of XftFreetype.h was wrong; fixed

    + xft-config --cflags and --libs now give more correct output
      (Closes: #179942, #179944)

  * configure.ac: add -lXext and -lX11 to XRENDER_LIBS
  * xft-config.in: add -lX11 to --libs output
  * xft.pc.in: add -lX11 to Libs line

  * the above changes ensure that libXft.so.2.1.1 has proper linkage, declares
    needed shared objects correctly, and thus enables dpkg-shlibdeps to find
    what it's looking for (Closes: #186042)

  * debian/*: various cosmetic cleanups
  * debian/control:

      library dependencies
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.5.9.
