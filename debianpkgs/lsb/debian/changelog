lsb (4.1+Debian7) unstable; urgency=low

  * lsb-desktop: Demote Qt3 dependency to a Recommends. Closes: #604360
    - Add a README.Debian to lsb-desktop to document the possibility to
      install Qt3 from snapshot.debian.org;
    - Add a NEWS.Debian to lsb-desktop to document the derogation to the
      LSB 4.1 specification.

  * Accept utf-8 in `apt-cache policy` and `dpkg-query` outputs; add
    test-case. (Closes: #675618)

lsb (4.1+Debian6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert "Allow FANCYTTY to be sourced from /etc/default/rcS." This
    avoids one ugly `set +u` in the $() subshell and avoids the hijack
    of /etc/default/rcS. (Reopens: #673207, Closes: #675162, #675197)

lsb (4.1+Debian5) unstable; urgency=low

  * lsb-base; init-functions:
    - Correct comment about hooks.
    - Enhance doc about files sourced from init-functions
    - Allow FANCYTTY to be sourced from /etc/default/rcS. (Closes: #673207)
    - Safe-guard calls to echo with `|| true`; this helps towards making
      sure init.d scripts called with `set -e` continue to work, see
      #661002.

  * lsb-release; python code:
    - In guess_debian_release(), avoid calling guess_release_from_apt()
      and hence the slow `apt-cache policy` if a codename is already
      provided. Patch by Francois Gouget. (Closes: #674143)
    - Add unittests for all lsb_release.py functions.
    - Upgrade to python3-compatible syntax.
    - Deprecate the lsb_release.compare_releases() function.

  * lsb-invalid-mta;
    -  Add the /usr/lib/sendmail symlink to /usr/sbin/sendmail.

lsb (4.1+Debian4) unstable; urgency=low

  * In init-functions, include hooks from /lib/lsb/init-functions.d
    - Source any file in there.
    - Document that in lsb-base.README.
    - Put the Ubuntu logging functions in there; remove the now-obsolete
      configuration file with dpkg-maintscript-helper.
    - Move the "Fancy output left info blocks" in there.

  * Python code: Add an initial (but incomplete) unittest framework for python
    2.7 and 3.2.

  * Properly document the first version with init_is_upstart.
  * Avoid writing the now useless lsb-qt4.substvars file.

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * Add the "lsb-invalid-mta" package, with a fake sendmail. This allows
    the installation of LSB packages to not pull in an MTA any more,

    (core LSB dependency for LSB 1.x); remove obsolete lsb-qt4 from its
    dependencies.
  * lsb-desktop now provides lsb-qt4*, essentially making lsb-qt4 a dummy
    package.
  * lsb-cxx: Don't depend on libstdc++5 on armel.

  * Fix crash when the Debian release is identified from
    /etc/debian_version and there is no corresponding codename (reported

    should be supplied by derived distributions.  (Closes: #396853)

  * Stop using basename: patch from Tore Anderson <tore@debian.org>
    (closes: #354028)
  * Move return code evaluation out of if $specified block in killproc, so
    that evaluation is dependant on whether or not process is running, not on

  * log_end_msg no longer returns non-zero.  It's a log function, after all
    (closes: #381687)
  * log_use_fancy_output is now overridable by admin (closes: #374780)
  * pidofproc actually checks if process is running (closes: #381684)

lsb (3.1-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Remove /usr/X11R6/bin from lsb-core, since I'm pretty sure it's not
    strictly necessary for LSB compliance and it breaks x.org 7.0.
    (Closes: #365264)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Apr 2006 17:33:15 -0400

lsb (3.1-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Depends: ia32-libs -> libc6-i386, lib32z1 on AMD64.  (Closes: #355388)
  * On purge or upgrade from < lsb-release 3.0-8, remove /etc/lsb-release
    if its md5sum is the same as that shipped in sarge.  (Closes: #355377)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Mar 2006 01:14:05 -0500

lsb (3.0-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Test $TERM in log_use_fancy_output; if it is "dumb" we don't have a
    fancy TTY.  (Closes: #350291)
  * Better heuristics in lsb_release to guess whether we're running on
    testing or unstable.  (Closes: #95824, #341231)
    Note that /etc/lsb-release, if present, will override these results,
    and /etc/debian_version has priority.
  * Fix lsb_release to allow multiple fields to be displayed (i.e.
    lsb_release --id --codename).

  * The "answer all the questions in the changelog" release.
  * Skip empty headers when parsing RFC822 headers for init scripts.
    (Closes: #343310)
  * The versioned dependency on dpkg-dev is due to the use of
    DEB_*_ARCH_CPU in debian/rules, which only became available in dpkg
    1.13.2.  Feel free to submit a patch to facilitate a sarge backport.
    (Closes: #344392)
  * Since the lsb family of packages track an upstream specification with
    "non-native" version numbering, the use of a hyphenated version number
    for these native packages is justified.  (Closes: #344384)
    (Note that although it does violate policy for a non-native package to
    lack a hyphen in its version number, the contrapositive case does not
    violate policy.)
  * Deal with missing /etc/debian_version.  (Closes: #341719)

    detected information in its place.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Sep 2005 19:16:00 -0400

lsb (3.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bring in lsb-release (binary) package; rewritten to handle -v properly
    for LSB 2.x and beyond.
  * /etc/lsb-release is no longer provided by the lsb-release package;
    it is probably best managed in base-files (which derived distros are
    probably branding anyway).

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Sep 2005 20:53:37 -0400

lsb (3.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

      cupsys-client | lprng (for /usr/bin/lp)
      mailutils | mailx (for /usr/bin/mailx)
    These are required in the final LSB 3.0 spec.

    (Closes: #321260)
  * Maintainers who are using the lsb-base logging facilities should
    *strongly* consider using log_daemon_msg() instead of log_start_msg();
    the new log_daemon_msg() is designed to meet both Debian and Ubuntu
    logging requirements.  Customization should come in a subsequent 3.0-x
    release.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Oct 2004 09:16:46 -0500

lsb (2.0-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix x86-64 ls-lsb symlink.  (Closes: #278093)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Oct 2004 19:50:00 -0500

lsb (2.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Upload to experimental so we don't break lsb 2.0-1 in unstable as it
    tries to migrate to sarge.
  * Split into lsb-core, lsb-graphics, and lsb-cxx packages, leaving lsb
    as a metapackage (lsb-graphics and lsb-cxx are also metapackages).
  * Include /lib64 in the AMD64 package rather than running mkdir in the
    postinst.
  * Revise README.Debian for LSB 2.0 and the package split; ensure LSB
    package install instructions are in the first page of text.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Sep 2004 21:38:36 -0500

lsb (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add lsb-core-{noarch,[arch]} Provides.
  * Symlink ld-lsb.so.2 to appropriate dynamic linker.
  * Add Japanese translation of debconf template.  (Closes: #270926)
  * Depend on ia32-libs on amd64.  (Closes: #259976)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Sep 2004 18:01:07 -0500

lsb (1.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Danish po file.  (Closes: #234406)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Feb 2004 15:04:37 -0600

lsb (1.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added German po file.  (Closes: #223120)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 31 Jan 2004 20:49:47 -0600

lsb (1.3-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Conflict with libutahglx1 instead of depending on xlibmesa3-gl.
    This will allow XFree86 4.3.0's libgl1 to be installed on the system.
  * Move conflicts with Python to 2.5, since 2.4 is not expected to be
    backwards incompatible with anything in the lsb package.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Nov 2003 12:02:01 -0600

lsb (1.3-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Depend on xlibmesa3-gl instead of libgl1.  (Closes: #220523)

    relative to the cwd, use it rather than prepending /etc/init.d.
    (Closes: #207851)
  * Added notes for backporting to woody to README.Debian.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Nov 2003 10:05:29 -0600

lsb (1.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note in README.Debian that the --lsbsysinit option in /etc/crontab is
    required for strict LSB compliance.  (Closes: #214896)
  * Re-enable $netdaemons facility in the "internal registry" again, as
    gLSB 1.1 included it and some packages appear to still use it.
    (Closes: #210578)
  * Use ld.so.1 symlink instead of the glibc-version-dependent location
    for s390.  (Closes: #216824)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Oct 2003 13:17:25 -0500

lsb (1.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  "cobaco":
  * Add Dutch translation of debconf template.  (Closes: #204921)
  Matt Taggart:
  * Add ia64 to description.  (Closes: #207694)
  Tobias Burnus:
  * Provide a skeleton LSB init script.  (Closes: #207715)
  * Numerous improvements to init-functions.  (Closes: #207639)
  Me:
  * Support broken uses of install_initd and remove_initd.
    (See #207851; still pondering on start_daemon's behavior.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Sep 2003 17:40:24 -0500

lsb (1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on pax.  (Closes: #203545)
  * Add ld.so symlink for ia64.  (Closes: #203541)
  * Improved French translation.  (Closes: #202692)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Aug 2003 18:13:08 -0400

lsb (1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use iteritems instead of the default iterator when saving the
    init script dependency dictionary.  (Closes: #202012)
  * Add a link to Matt Taggart's DebConf2 talk to README.Debian.
    (Closes: #198600)
  * Add French translation of debconf prompts.  (Closes: #201626)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Jul 2003 12:19:34 -0400

lsb (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release of LSB 1.3 for Debian.
  * Convert everything to Python 2.2+ style.
  * Clean up the parsing of header lines to be fully compliant.
  * Add po-debconf patch.  (Closes: #186853)
  * Don't retry if a signal specified in killproc.  (Closes: #167759)
  * Revise pidofproc to return a failure code if no pid found.
    (Closes: #190719)
  * Properly treat Required-Start and Required-Stop as strict dependencies
    (install_initd will now fail if they cannot be fulfilled.)
  * remove_initd will now fail if removing the init script would cause
    another LSB package to be missing a dependency.  (However, the
    tracking for these dependencies was not done in the past.  As this is
    part of gLSB 1.9, this should not be a problem.)
  * The previous two items were in a single report.  (Closes: #198293)
  * Support Should-Start and Should-Stop from gLSB 1.9.  (Closes: #198277)
    (A warning message will be output if a facility requested is unavailable.)
  * Support -p argument to killproc, pidofproc and start_daemon, per gLSB 1.9.
    (Closes: #197794)
  * Set up the ld-lsb symlink in the postinst, so it can vary between
    architectures, and remove in the prerm.  (Closes: #183617)
    Currently only defined for IA32 (i386), PPC32 (powerpc) and S390
    (s390); please let me know the correct link for IA64 (ia64) and any
    other ports that may be floating out there.  (I'm only interested in
    architectures that appear at http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/.)
  * Purge the lsb registry on package removal.
  * Depend on mawk | gawk; original-awk may not be SUS-compliant.
    (See http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/refspecs/LSB_1.3.0/gLSB/gLSB/awk.html)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Jun 2003 03:06:37 -0500

lsb (1.2-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix call to shadowconfig in postinst.  (Closes: #166041)
  * Add text to the debconf template that lets the user know that shadow
    passwords are not needed by most LSB applications.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Oct 2002 07:20:54 -0500

lsb (1.2-5) unstable; urgency=medium

lsb (1.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support more specifications for the signal in "killproc".
    (Closes: #163109)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Oct 2002 07:09:22 -0500

lsb (1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Return non-zero exit status if "pidofproc" can't find the process.
    (Closes: #157314)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Aug 2002 13:20:09 -0500

lsb (1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix silly typos in install_initd.  (Closes: #152544)
  * Fix duplicated --retry 5.  (Closes: #152552)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Jul 2002 15:48:10 -0500

lsb (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * ADV: Matt Taggart will be giving a presentation on LSB in Debian at
    Debconf2 on Sunday afternoon; your attendence and attentiveness is
    strongly encouraged :-)

  * First release of LSB 1.2 (hopefully-)compliant package.
  * Added link to joeyh's LSB testing page to README.Debian.
  * Revised README.Debian in light of LSB 1.2's improved verbiage.
  * Added support for facilities introduced in gLSB 1.2.  (Closes: #148568)
    - $time: start >= S24, stop <= K21
    - $portmap: start >= S19, stop <= K34
  * Removed support for the $netdaemons facility, which vanished from the
    specification.  Hopefully nobody is using it...
  * Call pidof if it's available and /var/run/$1.pid doesn't exist.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Jul 2002 19:48:35 -0500

lsb (1.1.0-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note that Debian's run-parts ignores certain lsb cron.* scripts, in
    violation of the LSB specification.  See #118646.
    (If necessary, run-parts may be diverted by this package to conform.)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Apr 2002 02:25:51 -0500

lsb (1.1.0-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force removal of rc.d links in remove_initd.  (Closes: #139400)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Mar 2002 22:43:01 -0600

lsb (1.1.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve error handing in {install,remove}_initd when no argument is
    specified.
  * Fix minor syntax error in outputing the facilities file.
  * Move facilities file handling into the initdutils module.
  * Changed facilities file format to allow multiple init scripts to
    provide the same facility w/o crashing.
  * These changes should solve all the init script handing bugs; thanks to
    Tobias Burnus <tburnus@physik.fu-berlin.de> for his testing.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Mar 2002 20:40:50 -0600

lsb (1.1.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix typo in debian/rules.  (Closes: #138945)
  * Rewrite the init script handling to improve modularity.
  * Fix typos in regexes in init script handling.  (Closes: #138946)

    the LSB spec.  (Closes: #138789)

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Mar 2002 18:27:42 -0600

lsb (1.1.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include /usr/X11R6/bin to make the LSB test suite happy.  Document
    LSB's lack of specification of an X server or any clients as required
    for compliance (hence making it odd that /usr/X11R6/bin would be
    needed, as it could conceivably be empty).  (Closes: #136713)
  * Prompt on installation if shadow passwords appear to be disabled, and
    enable them if requested.  (Closes: #136806)
  * Fix the spelling of Matt Taggart's name in README.Debian.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Mar 2002 23:19:39 -0600

  * Convert to arch-independent package.
  * Add lsb(8) manpage.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Feb 2002 21:42:26 -0600

lsb (1.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update README.Debian and install_initd to implement a few changes:
    - uid/gid for bin is documented.
    - treat RL 2-5 as the same, because nothing else sensible seems
      available.

 -- Chris Lawrence <lawrencc@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Feb 2002 20:08:23 -0600

lsb (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
