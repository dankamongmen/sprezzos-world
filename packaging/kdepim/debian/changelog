    - reenable kpilot;

    - remove ktnef;
    - libkabcommon4 - a common KDE address book library widely used by other
      KDE PIM packages. Add strict (=) shlibs for this library;
    - kdepim-groupwase - bundle all groupware related stuff into this
      package. Previously, groupware stuff was scattered all over application
      KDE PIM packages which resulted into complex and wrong interdependencies.
      kdepim-groupware package is self-contained dependency-wise;
    - libkontactinterfaces4 - split off this kontact interface library to the
      separate package. This allows to move kontact plugins to appropriate
      owner packages with them getting dependency on this package instead of
      the whole 'kontact'.
