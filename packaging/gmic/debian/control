Suggests: gimp-gmic, gmic-zart
Description: GREYC's Magic Image Converter
 G'MIC is an interpreter of image processing macros whose goal is to
 convert, manipulate and visualize generic 1D/2D/3D multi-spectral
 image files. This includes classical color images, but also more
 complex data as image sequences or 3D volumetric images.
 .
 This package contains the stand-alone gmic binary.

Description: GREYC's Magic Image Converter - ZArt
 G'MIC is an interpreter of image processing macros whose goal is to
 convert, manipulate and visualize generic 1D/2D/3D multi-spectral
 image files. This includes classical color images, but also more
 complex data as image sequences or 3D volumetric images.
 .
 This package contains ZArt, a program whose purpose is to demonstrate
 the possibilities of the G'MIC image processing language by offering
 the choice of several manipulations on a video stream acquired from a
 webcam. In other words, ZArt is a GUI for G'MIC real-time manipulations
 on the output of a webcam.
