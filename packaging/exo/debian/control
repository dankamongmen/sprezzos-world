Description: Library with extensions for Xfce
 libexo is a library for Xfce that contains a bunch of additional widgets and

 present in GNOME), light-weight session management support, functions to
 automatically synchronize object properties (based on GObject Binding
 Properties) and several miscellaneous utility and helper functions for
 application developers.

 desktop development, libexo is targeted at application development, with a
 focus on applications for Xfce.
