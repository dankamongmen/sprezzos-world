Description: heterogeneous set of I2C tools for Linux
 This package contains a heterogeneous set of I2C tools for Linux: a bus
 probing tool, a chip dumper, register-level access helpers, EEPROM
 decoding scripts, and more.

Description: userspace I2C programming library development files
 I2C devices are usually controlled by a kernel driver. Using this
 library it is also possible to access all devices on an adapter 
 from userspace and without the knowledge of Linux kernel internals.

Description: Python bindings for Linux SMBus access through i2c-dev 
 This Python module allows SMBus access through the I2C /dev interface on 
 Linux hosts.  The host kernel must have I2C support, I2C device interface
 support, and a bus adapter driver.
