Description: Red Hat cluster suite - metapackage
 RHCS is a cluster management infrastructure, for building
 high-availability multi-node clusters with service and IP failover on
 top of shared Fibre Channel/iSCSI storage devices.
 .
 The only scope for this package is to install the full Red Hat Cluster Suite
 in one operation. It is safe to remove it.

Description: Red Hat cluster suite - cluster manager
 This package is part of the Red Hat Cluster Suite, a complete
 high-availability solution.
 .
 CMAN is a symmetric general-purpose cluster manager. It provides a
 service manager that handles service groups, plus a connection
 manager that handles cluster membership management, messaging among
 the cluster nodes, event notification, quorum and state transitions.
 .
 This package contains only tools for controlling the cluster manager
 itself.
