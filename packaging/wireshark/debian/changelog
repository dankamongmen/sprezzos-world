    - Make tshark list interfaces for non-root user (Closes: #582298)
    - Fix duplicate inconsistent attributes in RADIUS dictionary.
      (Closes: #570132)
  * New libwireshark0, libwireshark-dev, libwiretap0, libwiretap-dev
    packages that reorganize libraries, header files, etc. as follows:
    - Moved libwireshark.so.* from package wireshark-common to package
      libwireshark0.
    - Moved libwsutil.so.* from package wireshark-common to package
      libwireshark0.
    - Moved libwiretap.so.* from package wireshark-common to package
      libwiretap0.
    - Moved header files, .so symlinks, and static libraries from package
      wireshark-dev to libwireshark-dev and libwiretap-dev, depending on
      the case.
    - Moved plugins in /usr/lib/wireshark/ from package wireshark-common
      to package libwireshark0.
    This provides more package granularity and allows easier use of
    libraries provided by the Wireshark project by applications that

    appears to use services offered by libwiretap, and upcoming package
    netexpect will use libwireshark services [see ITP bug #587056]).
