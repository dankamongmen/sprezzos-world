Description: multiple precision floating-point computation
 MPFR provides a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation
 with correct rounding.  The computation is both efficient and has a
 well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the
 ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic
 (53-bit mantissa).

Description: multiple precision floating-point computation (debug symbols)
 MPFR provides a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation
 with correct rounding.  The computation is both efficient and has a
