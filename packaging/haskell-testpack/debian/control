Description: Haskell Test Utility Pack for HUnit and QuickCheck
 testpack provides utilities for both HUnit and QuickCheck.  These include
 tools for running QuickCheck properties as HUnit test cases, allowing you to
 combine both approaches in a single program.  It also includes tools for more
 helpful displays of running progress in both HUnit and QuickCheck, additional
 generators for other types for QuickCheck, and shortcuts for quickly defining
 new test cases.
 .
 This package contains the development libraries.
