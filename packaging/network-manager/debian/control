Description: network management framework (daemon and userspace tools)
 NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices
 and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when
 available. It manages ethernet, WiFi, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE
 devices, and provides VPN integration with a variety of different VPN
 services.
 .
 This package provides the userspace daemons and a command line interface to
 interact with NetworkManager.
 .
 Optional dependencies:
  * policykit-1: Required for reading and writing system connections.
  * ppp: Required for establishing dial-up connections (e.g. via GSM).
  * dnsmasq-base/iptables: Required for creating Ad-hoc connections and
    connection sharing.
  * avahi-autoipd: Used for IPv4LL, a protocol for automatic Link-Local IP
    address configuration.
