libtorrent-rasterbar (0.14.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - new package libtorrent-rasterbar4 (bump up library soname).
  * debian/control:

    docs/libtorrent_plugins.rst was added upstream.

libtorrent-rasterbar (0.14.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version
    - new package libtorrent-rasterbar3 (bump up library soname).
  * debian/control:
    - add Vcs-* stuff (switch to git-buildpackage) and bump up
      Standards-Version to 3.8.1 (no changes required);
    - build-depends on debhelper (>= 7.0.50) and use override_dh_command;
    - move -dbg package to the new 'debug' section;
    - build-depends on autotools-dev and overwrite config.{sub,guess} with a
      recent version in debian/rules.
    - build-depends on quilt and python-docutils:
      + debian/patches/fix_html_docs.patch: fix html documentation for offline
        browsing and add another missing doc file;
      + rebuild docs at build time in debian/rules;
  * debian/example.makefile: install a simple makefile for example programs
    included in -doc package.
  * debian/rules, debian/python-libtorrent.install: don't rely on hardcoded
    python version, use --install-layout=deb when building python bindings,
    and install to '*-packages' instead of 'site-packages' (this should
    prepare for python2.6 and minimize Ubuntu diff).

libtorrent-rasterbar (0.14.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

    reverse depends clients and backporting to stable is not really needed
    (too much maintenance work) at the moment.
  * debian/README.source: deleted.

    to provide compatibility with boost1.34.1 for backports (adding some notes).
  * debian/control: fix lintian I:binary-control-field-duplicates-source.
  * Moving section from 'Programming' to 'Programming/C++' for the doc-base
    files in libtorrent-rasterbar-doc.
  * Closing a bug already fixed in 0.14-1: fixed documentation about
    storage_mode_allocate (Closes: #502241).

    supported by the library (added notes on README.Debian).
  * Install .cpp examples using dh_installexamples and a .examples file.

  * New upstream version.

      + new package python-libtorrent which contains python bindings
        for the library.
    - debian/rules:
      + use multi-threaded boost libraries (--with-boost-system=mt, ...);
      + add --disable-examples and --disable-tests options;
      + delete specific information about debian revision in dh_makeshlibs
        (i.e., use only dh_makeshlibs -V).
    - debian/control, debian/rules, debian/README.source, debian/patches:
      build-depends on quilt patch system and install a patch of mine

      bindings; use a temporary fix for the 'clean' target.

libtorrent-rasterbar (0.13.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - build with --disable-debug option because enabling debug seems to cause
    some clients to crash, and most upstream authors prefer a release build of
    the library.
    - added specific version information to dh_makeshlibs so that reverse
    dependencies will depend on this particular version.
  * README.Debian: updated with info about --disable-debug.
