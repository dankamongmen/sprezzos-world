 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Sat, 08 Oct 2011 18:03:06 -0400

opensp (1.5.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug reading locale files (closes: #611710).  Required changes to
    autotools scripts:
  - Use AX_DEFINE_DIR instead of AC_DEFINE_DIR.
  - Define SP_LOCALE_DIR as value of "localedir" rather than "datadir/locale".
  * Other autotools changes indirectly required by the above:
  - Added --warnings=no-portability to automake call.
  - Added AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS.
  * Updated standards version to 3.9.2.0 (no changes, but filed bug 628588
    for policy recommendation regarding .la files).

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Mon, 30 May 2011 11:48:25 -0400

  * Fix man page by removing gap. (Closes: #530962).
  * Updated standards version (no changes).
  * Updated to debhelper compat level 7.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Tue, 08 Jul 2008 21:39:08 -0400

opensp (1.5.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use pdftops instead of pdf2ps in the hope that it works on hppa and
    sparc. pdf2ps has lots of bugs filed for problems on that
    architecture. Correspondingly depend on xpdf-utils instead of
    gs-common.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Apr 2008 23:26:11 -0400

opensp (1.5.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Verified OpenSP builds with gcc 4.3.
  * Added comment to README.Debian about needing to explicitly specify
    declaration in some cases due to dropping DTDDECL support.  (Closes:
    #345478, #350797).

    Eisentraut. (closes: #353078)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Jun 2006 03:02:32 -0400

opensp (1.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: autoinit.sh is in top level dir, not debian dir.
  * Fix bug "segfaults in OpenSP::ParsedSystemId::unparse" submitted by
    Filipus Klutiero with patch submitted by Samuel Bronson, thanks to
    both. (closes: #361894)
  * Fixed bug "wrong dependencies" by removing dependencies of libosp-dev
    on packages that are part of build-essential: libc6-dev (directly) and
    libstdc++-dev (indirectly, but explicitly mentioned as unnecessary);
    thanks to Matthias Klose. (closes: #352944)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Jun 2006 13:53:10 -0400

opensp (1.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Use new --disable-dtddecl option to turn off DTDDECL support and get
    decent performance - finally! (closes: #138924, #208042)
  * New release now automatically builds docs.  Updated Build-Depends to
    suit.
  * New package name for library (libosp5) because of soname change.
  * Upstream man pages were modified to fix "onsgmls.1.gz etc.: NAME
    section too long" (closes: #341644)
  * The bug "opensp: strange error when parsing an HTML file with onsgmls
    using stdin" was present through the last release, and there does not
    appear to be any explicit bug fix upstream that fixed this, but
    testing shows it is fixed in this release. (closes: #170795)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Dec 2005 11:22:16 -0500

opensp (1.5.1.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix French translation, thanks to Yann Dirson. (closes: #240996)
  * Fix German translation, thanks to Jens Seidel (closes: #313938)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Aug 2005 22:54:28 -0400

opensp (1.5.1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added autoinit.sh from SourceForge web site, missing from package.
  * Acknowledge NMU. (closes: #260797, #311967)
  * Removed /usr/local/lib/sgml (removed /usr/lib/sgml in -2).
  * rules: Added dh_buildinfo.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jul 2005 22:42:05 -0400

opensp (1.5.1.0-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU for C++ transition.
    - Changed libosp4 into libosp4c2
    - Make libosp4c2 conflicts with libosp4
    - Make libosp4c2 replaces libosp4
  * Fixed build with gcc-4.0. Thanks to Andreas Jochen for the patch (closes:
    bug#260797).
  * Updated libtool to make sure the library depends on libstdc++. That also
    fixes the build on GNU/kFreeBSD (closes: bug#311967).

 -- Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jul 2005 18:24:48 +0200

opensp (1.5.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /usr/share/sgml to default sgml search path. (closes: #231594)
  * Removed /usr/lib/sgml from default sgml search path; it is
    deprecated. The old sp program has not had this path for a while, with
    no bugs reported, so I concluded this is safe to do.
  * Changed list of default catalogs, all of the form */catalog, to single
    entry, "/etc/sgml/catalog".  Any system catalog not found this way is
    broken.
  * /usr/share/doc/opensp/sysid.htm has an explanation that makes clear
    why the above changes are valid.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Mar 2004 14:44:09 -0500

opensp (1.5.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (no change from pre1)
  * Fix FTBFS due to documentation building tools which are not needed for
    normal package builds (docs ship with package).

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Oct 2003 16:05:01 -0400

opensp (1.5.1pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (almost):
  - Fixes "opensp: Segmentation fault with osx" from Philippe Batailler
    (closes: #198641)
  - New ABI, so replaced libosp3c102 with new library package
    libosp4. Upstream incorporated my changes to configure.in and gettext
    so that libosp4 can coexist with older versions of libosp, if
    necessary (see 1.5release-4 changelog).
  - Added build dependency on openjade | openjade1.3, jadetex,
    xmlto and docbook-xsl for documentation building.
  - Change of libosp3c102 to libosp4 neatly sidesteps the problems that
    arose in dist-upgrading from libosp2 or libosp3 to libosp3c102. With
    this release, dist-upgrading from any of libosp2 (stable), libosp3
    (old testing), and libosp3c102 (recent testing) to libosp4 (unstable)
    all work properly. (closes: #204219)
  * Cleaned up debian/rules by replacing many commands with debhelper
    equivalents.
  * Upgraded to Standards-Version 3.6.1: no changes.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Sep 2003 14:51:19 -0400

opensp (1.5release-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made earliest libosp version that opensp can depend on 1.5release-0.1
    (closes: #170253)
  * Changed section of libosp-dev to libdevel to match current override.
  * Changed use of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to conform to policy:
    - set -g by default instead of -O2
    - add -O2 if "noopt" is present, else -O0
    - do nothing if "debug" is present rather than add -g
  * Fixed failure to dist-upgrade.  Required allowing libosp3c102 to
    coexist with libosp2, upon which new and old versions of opensp
    depend.  These changes had the side effect of undoing the change that
    closed 186051 and fixing it properly. (closes: #184645)
    - Set Conflicts:, Replaces: and Provides: for libosp3c102 to libosp3.
    - Moved libosp version info to configure.in.
    - Versionized the gettext files with libosp version info, so sp.mo becomes
    sp3.mo for each locale.
  * Added call to dh_makeshlibs followed by call to dh_shlibdeps, exactly
    like the example in man page for dh_shlibdeps.
  * Upgraded to Standards-Version 3.6.0

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Fri,  1 Aug 2003 17:05:35 -0400

    html; fixes lintian error due to policy change.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Mon, 19 May 2003 17:35:11 -0400

opensp (1.5release-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #165810).
  * Ignored all modifications to upstream code, most of them being in

  * Commented out regeneration of autotools files, do not build-depend on
    them any more.  Run distclean instead of maintainer-clean.
  * libosp soname bumped to 3, changed package name in accordance, and
    replaced references to libosp2 in docs with generic libosp.
  * Configure with --enable-xml-messages.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Oct 2002 08:33:43 +0100

opensp (1.5pre5-5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU

opensp (1.5pre5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * ship PO files in libosp package

    call itself 1.5pre6, however
  * nsgmls: apply a patch which should enable compilation on gcc 3.0
    closes: #103791
  * debian/rules: make maintainer-clean upstream is incredibly fragile,
    so tolerate errors there until that gets fixed
  * debian/rules: during build, run libtoolize --force to replace this

    libtool stuff OpenSP ships with
    closes: #101837, #104126
  * debian/rules, control: use dh_shlibdeps, remove some hand-rolled stuff
    here which was unnecessary and in fact adding two libosp deps on the
