    sets it to 512. It was intended to increase the limit from its historical
    value of 32. However, since 2007 the default limit has been 8192, so this
    is actually a reduction. (Closes: #678965)

    (Closes: #672963)
  * debian/network-manager.maintscript: Use new versioning scheme as

    and use the dh_install maintscript facility to move the conffile on
    upgrades. This requires a newer debhelper, so bump the Build-Depends
    accordingly.
  * Use dh_install maintscript to handle the other conffiles as well.

    - Added 08-disabled_devices.patch. Network interfaces listed in

      statically and have NM not messing with them.
