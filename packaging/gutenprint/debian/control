Description: inkjet server - Ghostscript driver for Gutenprint
 This package contains the ijsgutenprint binary which provides
 Ghostscript with a Gutenprint driver, including all printers
 supported by Gutenprint.  ijsgutenprint is an IJS server (driver),
 which communicates with Ghostscript (an IJS client) using the IJS
 (InkJet Server) communications protocol.  IJS is a method for
 separating ghostscript drivers from ghostscript, to allow
 ghostscript to be more extensible.

 If you wish to print using Ghostscript and the Gutenprint drivers,
 install this package.  This is typical for LPRng setups.  If you
 are using CUPS, printer-driver-gutenprint is a better choice, but
 this package will still work with the appropriate foomatic setup
 if you wish to make use of foomatic.
