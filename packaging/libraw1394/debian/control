Description: library for direct access to IEEE 1394 bus - development files
 libraw1394 is the only supported interface to the kernel side raw1394
 of the Linux IEEE-1394 subsystem, which provides direct access to the
 connected 1394 buses to user space.  Through libraw1394/raw1394,
 applications can directly send to and receive from other nodes without
 requiring a kernel driver for the protocol in question.
 .
 This package contains the include files, static library and development
 tools for libraw1394.
