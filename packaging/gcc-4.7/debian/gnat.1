.SH NAME
gnat, gnatbind, gnatbl, gnatchop, gnatfind, gnathtml, gnatkr, gnatlink,
gnatls, gnatmake, gnatprep, gnatpsta, gnatpsys, gnatxref \-
GNAT toolbox
.SH DESCRIPTION
Those programs are part of GNU GNAT, a freely available Ada 95 compiler.
.PP
For accessing the full GNAT manuals, use
.B info gnat-ug-4.7
and
.B info gnat-rm-4.7
for the sections related to the reference manual.
If those sections cannot be found, you will have to install the
gnat-4.4-doc package as well (since these manuals contain invariant parts,
the package is located in the non-free part of the Debian archive).
You may also browse
.B http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs
which provides the GCC online documentation.
.SH AUTHOR
This manpage has been written by Samuel Tardieu <sam@debian.org>, for the
Debian GNU/Linux project.
