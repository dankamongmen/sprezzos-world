mpeg2dec (0.5.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update patch 65_arm-test-with-compiler to only set ARCH_ARM when
    optimizations are built; ARCH_ARM is really used as a test for whether to
    use ARM optimizations or not in the sources; also cleanup autotools syntax
    with proper AC_LANG(C), AC_LANG_SOURCE and quoting.

mpeg2dec (0.5.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix ARM tests in configure.ac to check for availability of the "pld [r1]"
    assembly snippet rather than relying on triplets; drop ARM specific logic
    from rules; closes: #679178.  NB: these ARM specific optimizations aren't
    picked up at runtime due to lack of autodetection on ARM.

mpeg2dec (0.5.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * Upload to unstable. (Closes: #659705)
  * Update maintainer information.
  * Convert package to 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Introduce Multiarch support.
  * debian/{control,rules}:
    - Remove depedency on gnome-pkg-tools, seems unnecessary.
  * debian/control:
    - Remove duplicate field.
    - Remove David I. Lehn from the Uploaders field. (Closes: #557280)
    - Remove URLs from packages descriptions, the Homepage: field is enough.
    - Avoid to use first person in packages descriptions.
    - Bump Standards.
  * Add lintian override for shlib-with-non-pic-code as it is deliberate.

mpeg2dec (0.5.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * New patch, 60_arm-private-symbols, set visibility of global symbols used
    in ARM specific assembly file to internal; spotted my make check on armel;
    thanks Riku Voipio for the report.
  * New patch, 61_global-symbol-test, rewrite the public symbol check to
    verify the shared libraries, to check for more things, and to avoid
    duplication; fixes make check on ARM.

 -- Loic Minier <lool@dooz.org>  Sat, 20 Dec 2008 09:42:41 +0100

mpeg2dec (0.5.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Anchor package name extraction re.
  * Stop shipping *.la; only reference in rdeps is in
    /usr/lib/libextractor/libextractor_mpeg.la but apps are supposed to link
    to libextractor; hopefully libltdl3 doesn't rely on *.la or libextractor
    might require a binNMU.
  * New upstream release, with ABI changes and API additions; in particular,
    care should be taken to handle the new mpeg2_state_t
    STATE_SEQUENCE_MODIFIED.
    - Target experimental for now.
    - Build-dep on libx11-dev (upstream calls AC_PATH_XTRA) and libxext-dev.
    - Drop patch 62_drop-arch-opts and build with -mcpu=i486 on i386, -mcpu=v7
      -mno-vis on sparc, -mno-altivec -UARCH_PPC on powerpc, and -UARCH_ARM on
      arm in CFLAGS instead for reasons detailed in debian/rules; upstream
      enables various features based on the GNU host triplet if the compiler
      supports them, but this would taylor the binaries for the buildds'
      capabilities which might be higher than the Debian requirements.
    - Drop patch 64_non-pic-on-i386-only, merged upstream in a slightly
      different way.
    - Drop patch 66_add-dummy-handler-and-sanity-checks, merged upstream.
    - Drop patch 68_honor-cflags, upstream doesn't empty CFLAGS anymore.
    - Drop patch 70_autoconf, not needed anymore per above removals.
    - Update watch file for new upstream tarball name (libmpeg2-*).
  * Set DEB_MAKE_CHECK_TARGET to run testsuite during build.
  * Bump up Standards-Version to 3.8.0.

mpeg2dec (0.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move mpeg2dec to Section: x11 instead of graphics to match overrides.
  * Bump up Debhelper compatibility level to 5; bump up debhelper build-dep to
    >= 5.
  * Add -Wl,-z,defs -Wl,--as-needed to LDFLAGS; build-dep on cdbs >= 0.4.41.
  * New patch, 62_drop-arch-opts, drop arch-specific CFLAGS detection in
    upstream configure as we want to use the gcc defaults to work on all
    machines which Debian will be installed on, and not use the buildds as
    references.
  * Add Homepage.

mpeg2dec (0.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump up Standards-Version to 3.7.3.
    - This new version allows PIC shared libraries on some arches;
      closes: #268603.
  * Wrap build-deps, deps, and uploaders.
  * Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version}; build-dep on dpkg-dev
    >= 1.13.19.
  * Cleanup rules.
  * Retrieve the shared library package name (with SONAME) from control.
  * Move docs installation to debian/*.docs.
  * Drop useless libc6-dev | libc-dev dep.
  * Drop now useless README.Debian.
  * Use a wildcard to install the examples.
  * Install man pages via dh_install.
  * Pass --sourcedir=debian/tmp to dh_install.
  * Build-dep on gnome-pkg-tools (>= 0.7) and include clean-la.mk.
  * Build-dep on libxv-dev for xv output; thanks Jack Bates; closes: #390931.
  * Add watch file.
  * New patch, 66_add-dummy-handler-and-sanity-checks, fixes SEGV when playing
    http://sam.zoy.org/zzuf/lol-mplayer.m2v; from MPlayer; thanks
    Lionel Debroux; closes: #407922.
  * Add Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser URLs.
  * New patch, 68_honor-cflags, don't reset CFLAGS in configure.in;
    closes: #403194.
  * Update patches 64_non-pic-on-i386-only and 68_honor-cflags to not patch
    configure and add a new patch, 70_autoconf, to update configure by running
    autoconf.
  * Unset DEB_OPT_FLAGS to leave it to upstream configure to select the opt
    level when noopt isn't in DEB_BUILD_OPTS; this allows -O3 to be selected
    instead of the cdbs default of -O2.

mpeg2dec (0.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build against the default gcc version, we're too far away of 2.95 for the
    optimizations specific to this compiler to make sense anyway.
  * New upstream bugfix release; no API or ABI changes.
    - Drop patch 08_cleaner-bootstrap, merged upstream.
    - Drop patch 16_no-inline-setjmp, merged upstream.
    - Drop patch 32_amd64-cpuid, merged upstream.

mpeg2dec (0.4.0b-2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * As proposed to the release team and to debian-sparc@, build the sparc
    version with gcc-3.3 for now, until a better fix is found; hence
    build-depend on gcc-3.3 under sparc and gcc-3.4 on non-sparc.

mpeg2dec (0.4.0b-2.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * As discussed with upstream, the source was developped with the 3.x series
    of gcc and optimized quite specifically for gcc 2.95 and 3.x, trying to
    build with gcc 4.0 will probably bring lower performances, and forbids
    usage of -O3; hence Build-depend on gcc-3.4 and build with gcc-3.4, should
    build on m68k and sparc again. (Closes: #323134)
