Description: modular DocBook DSSSL stylesheets, for print and HTML
 This package provides DSSSL stylesheets which let you convert DocBook
 SGML or XML files to various formats.
 .
 This package contains two DocBook DSSSL stylesheets, one for "print"
 output and one for HTML.  The print stylesheet can be used in
 conjunction with the RTF and the TeX back-ends that (Open)Jade
 provides to produce output suitable for printing.  The HTML
 stylesheet can be used to convert DocBook documents into HTML.
 .
 The stylesheets are modular in design so that you can extend and
 customize them.
 .
 Note that you can also perform DocBook XML styling using the
 "docbook-xsl" package, which provides the XSL stylesheets.  The XSL
 stylesheets are more actively maintained and contain more new
 features than these DSSSL stylesheets.
