gpsd (3.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * [8607cd96] Add some bugfixes from upstream.
    - Avoid adding devices with path names longer than
      GPS_PATH_MAX
    - Accept Freescale i.MX processor UARTs as serial port
    - Fix the notification of ntpd about leap seconds.
  * [528213ef] Update regression tests according to the leap second change.
    Whenever the default leap second changes in timebase.h the
    GPS tests will break (times one second off) and the testloads will
    have to be rebuilt.  The problem is in the SiRF tests; that driver
    relies on the default until it gets the current offset from subframe
    data.
    timebase.h is being created from the leapseconds.cache file at build
    time. As leapseconds happen rarely, there is no support to read them
    from a config file included yet.

    This reverts commit bc30a21b6046bb7153ce7a4e8606017231717803.
    makedev seems to be required on mips.
  * [d7d04c9b] libgps20: demote gpsd from Recommends to Suggests.
    There is still no nice-ish way to tell gpsd to ignore some devices from
    being detcted automatically. Not installing gpsd might be the better
    option here - please note that I'm still not convinced to keep it as
    'Suggsts' - but for now it will stay there. (Closes: #662587)

  * [06466618] Don't add . as target for scons -c
  * [5fb7dd4f] Updating libqgpsmm20.symbols.
    Most of the code is being built with g++ now, so symbol names have

    there are only a few rare users of the library so far.

         protocol the daemon uses.
  * [ef59451f] Ignore symbols files changes when DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS is
    set. Not stripping the library leaves some additional symbols, so we
    just ignore that when the package is being built with debug options.

  * Removing Tachometer.c due to an unclear licensing, this introduces
    .dfsg to the version number and results in not being able to build
    xgpsspeed.
  * Building new packages:
    - python-gps containing the python modules, this also fixes a bug
      complaining about missing python-support (Closes: #413925)

  * Auto discovery of USB GPS devices is disabled by default now, as the USB
    devices use nothing but a standard usb to serial converter. This resulted
    in trouble if you wanted to use a normal serial converter without attached
    GPS device. A rules file is provided as example now.

      packaging (debian/{gpsd,gpsd-clients}.install, debian/gpsd.examples)
      and removes several unused/obsolete files:
      (debian/{remove_rpath.sh,gpsd-clients.docs}, debian/*.dirs,
