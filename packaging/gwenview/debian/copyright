    All files say:
     * This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
     * For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.

    In plain English:

       1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
          please let us know!)
       2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay
          us.
       3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
          program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
          you've used the IJG code.

        In legalese:

     The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
     with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
     fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
     its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

     must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
     (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
     documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
     the Independent JPEG Group".
     (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
     full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
     NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

     not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
     acknowledge us.

     Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
     in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
