    Debian FAQ and TODO files are installed.
  * Let all library, -dev and -dbg packages directly depend on libtinfo5
    and replace their /usr/share/doc directories with symlinks to save
    some space.
  * Mark ncurses-base and ncurses-term as Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * Explicitly blacklist fbterm and stterm terminfo entries to prevent
    accidents like #665877.

  * Update terminfo descriptions to the 20120407 upstream patchlevel.
    - Revert to linux2.2 rather than linux3.0 as the base for the linux
      terminfo entry, since the latter breaks display of line drawing
      characters in non-UTF-8 locales (closes: #665959).

      directory in compiled terminfo descriptions (see #509919).
  * Mention in debian/README.source that a non-standard autoconf version is
    required to regenerate 'configure' (Closes: #580190).
  * New patch 00-terminfo-update.diff, updating terminfo descriptions to
    the 20120211 upstream patchlevel.
    - Includes entries for gnu-mach and gnu-mach-color, installed into
      the ncurses-base package (Closes: #614316).
  * Update xterm.ti from xterm 276.  All xterm-* terminfo entries should
    have kbs=\177 now.  Update patch 02-debian-backspace.diff accordingly.
  * Drop patch 05-emdebian-wchar.diff, no longer needed.
  * Protect shell loops in debian/rules with "set -e" to ensure that
    any errors in them are caught (see Policy §4.6).

 -- Sven Joachim <svenjoac@gmx.de>  Tue, 01 Nov 2011 20:27:49 +0100

ncurses (5.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

    - Symlink libtinfo.a to libtermcap.a.
    - Use a linker script for libtermcap.so to work around ldconfig
      bug #249122.

  * Drop libticw from libncursesw5 and configure with "--with-ticlib=tic"
    to share the same tic library between libncurses5 and libncursesw5.
  * Don't mark libncurses5-dev and libncursesw5-dev as "Multi-Arch: same"
    for now (Closes: #646761).
  * Link the example programs against ncursesw rather than ncurses.
  * Add Breaks against binutils-gold (<< 2.21.53.20110910) to
    libncurses5-dev and libncursesw5-dev (see #644708).

  * Drop the lintian overrides introduced in 5.9-2.

 -- Sven Joachim <svenjoac@gmx.de>  Mon, 31 Oct 2011 17:18:46 +0100

ncurses (5.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build libncurses and libncursesw with "--with-termlib" and split out
    libtinfo* packages to allow building a libreadline that does not link
    against libncurses.  Thanks to Matthias Klose for the initial patch.
    (Closes: #631592)
    - Add Pre-dependency on libtinfo5 to libncurses5 to prevent possible
      symbol lookup errors if libncurses5 is unpacked before libtinfo5.
    - Replace the libncurses{w,}.so symlinks with linker scripts.  Since
      lintian does not like those in multiarch paths, temporarily add
      overrides (see #639735).
    - Remove spurious leftover libncurses5.so.5 symlinks (Closes: #224450,
      LP: #836246).

  * Configure all library builds except libncurses5 with "--without-progs"
    to reduce build time a bit.
  * Add build-arch and build-indep targets to debian/rules.
  * Use dh_install's "--fail-missing" option.
  * Build for multiarch (Closes: #638281).
    - Mark libncurses5, libncursesw5, libtinfo5 and their -dev counterparts
      as Multi-Arch: same.
    - Mark ncurses-bin as Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * New patch 03-debian-ncursesconfig-omit-L.diff to omit the "-L" part
    from "ncurses5-config --libs" (see #638281).

    (Closes: #638189).

  * Update rxvt-unicode terminfo description from upstream CVS Rev 1.29.
    - Introduce an rxvt-unicode-256color terminfo entry in ncurses-term
      (Closes: #613171).
    - Fix typo in kIC terminfo capability (Closes: #446444).
  * Adjust the Replaces/Breaks combination on mlterm-common, now that
    mlterm 3.0.2-1 has dropped the mlterm terminfo entry.
  * Fix the libncursesw5-dbg preinst which had been removing the wrong
    symlink since it was introduced.
  * Drop the other preinst scripts, they were only necessary for upgrades
    from pre-Lenny versions.
  * Use linux-any wildcard for libgpm-dev Build-Depends and
    libgpm2 Recommends instead of using a list of negated architectures.
  * Do not run uupdate from debian/watch.

ncurses (5.7+20101128-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sven Joachim ]
  * New upstream patchlevel.
    - Clarify that infotocap, captoinfo and tic read text files and do
      not work with compiled terminfo files (Closes: #593920).
  * Remove dangling /usr/share/terminfo/k/kon2 symlink (Closes: #522435).
  * Add an ncurses-examples package containing the compiled test programs
    (Closes: #34182).  Stop shipping the sources in libncurses5-dev.
  * Move documentation and section 3 manpages to a new ncurses-doc package
    (Closes: #233400).  Suggest ncurses-doc in all -dev packages.
  * Register the documentation in doc-base (Closes: #451667).
  * Remove the rather useless README.Debian (Closes: #606034).
  * Move libtic libraries to /usr.
  * Tighten the dependencies of the lib{32,64}ncurses*-dev packages to their
    regular counterparts.
  * Provide symbols files in all library packages.
    - Use them to compute the dependencies of the other packages instead of
      messing around with local shlibs files.
  * Ship mlterm terminfo in ncurses-term (see #485448).
  * Ship curses and termcap symlinks in lib{32,64}ncurses5-dev (LP: #485118).
  * Add lintian override for the empty /usr/share/terminfo directory that
    was introduced in 5.7+20100313-2.
  * Stop building the test programs in every library build.
  * Fix non-idempotency of the install (and thus the binary) target in
    debian/rules introduced in 5.7+20100313-1.
  * Do not unnecessarily add /lib32 and /usr/lib32 to dh_shlibdeps' search
    path when calculating the dependencies of the 32-bit libraries.
  * Do not allow dh_shlibdeps to fail for the 64-bit libraries.
  * Drop most patches as obsolete or unused:
    - 09-fix-delscreen-segfault.diff, applied upstream.
    - 06-kfreebsd.diff, apparently no longer needed.
    - 03-linux-use-fsuid.diff, patched code that is not compiled if ncurses
      is configured with "--disable-termcap", as we do.
    - 01-use-d-reentrant.diff, no longer needed since all architectures moved
      away from LinuxThreads and Policy 3.9.1 has explicitly removed the need
      to #define _REENTRANT.
  * Refresh all remaining Debian patches and add DEP-3 headers to them.
  * Remove the fix for bug #127622 from 02-debian-backspace.diff,
    no longer needed.
  * Update patch 02-debian-backspace.diff to get kbs=\177 in all screen-*
    terminfo entries (Closes: #602300).
  * Drop the rather outdated screen terminfo from the debian directory and use
    the one provided by upstream's terminfo.src instead.
  * Get CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags, adding a build
    dependency on dpkg-dev (>= 1.15.7).
  * Switch to format 3.0 (quilt).
    - Remove quilt build dependency and patch/unpatch logic from debian/rules.
    - Drop debian/README.source.
  * Add a debian/watch file.
  * Extend the package descriptions.
  * Remove duplicate "Priority:" fields from debian/control.
  * Update debian/copyright:
    - Update FSF Copyright years.
    - Mention other copyright holders and licenses.
    - Give a pointer to the current location of the ncurses sources.
    - Stop mentioning Debian changes.
  * Upgrade Standards-Version to 3.9.1, no changes needed.

  [ Loïc Minier ]
  * Update patch 05-emdebian-wchar to apply cleanly.
  * Drop 08-pkg-config-libdir patch as dpkg >= 1.15.6 don't set
    PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR anymore.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Export LDFLAGS in debian/rules (Closes: #586144).

  * Rename source package back to 'ncurses' (ncurses 4.2 becomes 'ncurses4.2').
  * Revamp debian/rules.
  * Use ncurses fallback mechanism, thereby eliminating ncurses-base.
    - Add new xterm* terminfo from Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org>.
  * libncurses5-dev:
    - Include libncurses++ and headers now that upstream installs them.
      (closes:Bug#42357)
    - Now depends on libncurses5 (= ${Source-Version) (closes:Bug#35422)
    - Add devel symlinks for libtermcap for user convenience.
    - Don't make /usr/include/ncurses symlink anymore.
  * ncurses-bin:
    - Move man5 and man7 man pages here (closes:Bug#20291).
    - Bug #27607 apparently fixed upstream:
       + modify _nc_set_writedir() to set a flag in _nc_tic_dir() to prevent
         it from changing the terminfo directory after chdir'ing to it.
         Otherwise, a relative path in $TERMINFO would confuse tic (from a
         Debian bug report). (closes:Bug#27067)
  * ncurses-term: Replaces ncurses-base.
    - Close silly bug (closes:Bug#49483).

ncurses (1.9.9g-8.9) hamm-updates; urgency=high (security fix)

  * [ncurses/{read_termcap,read_entry}.c] Security fix for setuid operation:

    (based on ncurses-1.9.9e-setuid.patch courtesy of Red Hat).

ncurses (1.9.9g-8.8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * The debugging version in ncurses3.4-dbg was not actually compiled with -g.
    This makes it rather unuseful.  It's due to an error in the configure.in,
    which refers to variables ac_cv_prog_gcc_g and ac_cv_prog_gxx_g to check
    if "-O2 -g" is supported.  This should be ac_cv_prog_cc_g and
    ac_cv_prog_cxx_g instead.  Fixed.
  * debian/xterm.ti had a "blink@" entry for the xterm terminal, which
    cancels the blink capability ("mb").  Since it has no "use" line,
    the use resolver is never called for it, which leaves the "CANCEL"
    value in the compiled info for xterm.
    tgetstr() does not check for cancelled values, so it returns the
    CANCELLED_STRING value which is not a valid pointer.
    Fixed by having tgetstr() return NULL for cancelled values.
    This fixes the bug that causes screen to crash in an xterm (bug#23998).

ncurses (1.9.9g-8.7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * For reasons that I don't understand, using ncurses3.4 >= 1.9.9g-8.1 with
    ncurses3.4-dev 1.9.9g-8.6 causes lxdialog (kernel's make menuconfig)
    to segfault. Changed the dependency to >= Source-Version. (Fixes
    release-critical #24392).
  * More manpages fixes (Fixes #24400):
    * [aclocal.m4] Rewrote the manpages fixing code somewhat so that
      references like "\fBcurses\fR(3X), " get handled correctly
    * [man/curs_termcap.3x] Minor changes, so that references get translated
      properly.
    * [man/man_db.renames] Added terminfo.\*n and curs_terminfo.\*n .

ncurses (1.9.9g-8.5) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * *sigh* -8.4 had several problematic leftovers from debugging in it:
  * - built with assertions and without _REENTRANT .
    - wrong fix in the library code. (this broke "screen").
  * Despite the bad karma with -8.4, I still feel strongly that this should
    go into frozen, due to the amount and severity of the bugs it fixes.

ncurses (1.9.9g-8.4) frozen unstable; urgency=high (fixes coredumps and makes documentation usable)

  * [progs/tput.c] Corrected the handling of error returns from setupterm()
    (to the way ncurses 4.2 does it).
    Fixes the "tput dumps core on unknown TERM" bug. (Fixes #5600).
  * [progs/toe.c] Set pointers to NULL after free-ing (like ncurses 4.2
    does) This fixes the "toe segfaults on megatek" bug. (Fixes #22280).
  * Fixed manpages and their cross-references:
    (Fixes #2806, #5363, #6822, #7889, #9977, #15120, #15637, #15088,
     #10064, #18669).
    * [aclocal.m4] Fixed the generation of the manpage transformation sed
      script so that it also transforms references like
      \fBcurs_refresh\fR(3X) . Warning: attempts to understand this code may
      cause psychological trauma due to exposure to quoting hell.
    * [man/{curs_bkgd,resizeterm,wresize}.3x] Removed otherwise empty "."
      lines between .TH and .SH lines which caused whatis parse to fail.
    * [debian/rules, debian/routines.pl] Added links for the ncurses and form
      routines to the appropriate manpages.
  * Include tutorial (misc/ncurses-intro.{doc,html) in the development package.
  * [misc/ncurses-intro.doc] Corrected umlaut in Juergen's first name.

ncurses (1.9.9g-8.3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * The fix wrt "bool" introduced in -8.1 causes problems when a >= -8.1
    -dev package is used with a < -8.1 runtime package.
    Added (>= 1.9.9g-8.1) to Depends: ncurses3.4 to prevent this situation
    from reoccuring (Fixes #22475).

ncurses (1.9.9g-8.2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.

    bo/ncurses3.0-dev 1.9.9e-1 (usr/lib/lib{form,menu,ncurses,panel}_g.a)
    which Richard Braakman reported on debian-devel; used "Replaces:"
    rather than "Conflicts:" (there is an implicit conflict already).

ncurses (1.9.9g-8.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Added a new xterm terminfo entry: kbs changed from ^H to \177
    and kdch1 from \177 to \E[3~ (per policy) (addresses part of #21914).
  * Make /usr/lib/libn?curses.so absolute rather than symbolic links
    (as per policy) (fixes #21913).
  * aclocal.m4: Invoke gzip with '-9'.
  * Generated "configure" with up to date autoconf; the old configure needed
    libg++-dev (the test for handling of type bool used <builtin.h>). Thus,
    "bool" is properly detected (fixes #20534, #17763).
  * Updated shlibs to >= this version, just in case the bool issue affects
    compatibility.
  * Fixed some file/directory permissions.
