This Package is now in Debian form in the main CVS repository.

This package was initially debianized by Milan Zamazal <pdm@debian.org>.  It
is presently being maintained by Salvador Abreu <spa@debian.org>.

It was made from a snapshot of the GNU Prolog CVS archive on sourceforge.net,
taken slightly before the package itself was made.
