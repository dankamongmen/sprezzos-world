Description: daemon for the Soprano RDF framework
 Soprano is a pluggable RDF storage, parsing, and serialization framework based
 on Qt 4. Soprano is targeted at desktop applications that need to store RDF
 data. Its API has been optimized for simplicity and ease of use, while its
 modular structure allows it to use various different RDF storage
 implementations as its backend.
 .
 This package contains the Soprano daemon, D-Bus service, parser plugins, and a
 storage plugin for the Redland RDF Application Framework. This package is not
 intended to be neither directly installed nor used by end users. It will be
 installed automatically whenever needed.
