 No license is required to download and use dcraw.c.  However,
 to lawfully redistribute dcraw, you must either (a) offer, at
 no extra charge, full source code* for all executable files
 containing RESTRICTED functions, (b) distribute this code under
 the GPL Version 2 or later, (c) remove all RESTRICTED functions,
 re-implement them, or copy them from an earlier, unrestricted

 The functions that process Foveon images have been RESTRICTED
 since Revision 1.237.  All other code remains free for all uses.

 homepage qualifies as "full source code".
