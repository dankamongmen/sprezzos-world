    - build for Python 3 too
    - split python-dbus-dev into a separate package to be shared between
      versions
    - make python-dbus depend on python-dbus-dev for now, to preserve
      historical functionality (but packages which use it, like PyQt, should
      switch to depending on it explicitly)

dbus-python (0.84.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

dbus-python (0.82.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Update debian/copyright for more permissive licensing.
  * Delete .pyc files in source tree in clean target (Closes: #442539).
    Because we're using an out-of-tree build to get the multiple Python
    versions, we can't rely on upstream's "make clean" to do the job.
  * Actually install examples into python-dbus-doc (Closes: #443719).
  * Build a python-dbus-dbg package like in Ubuntu (Closes: #441737).
  * Also delete stale Python 2.5 bytecode in postinst (required in Ubuntu,
    unnecessary but harmless in Debian) to reduce divergence.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Use download URL in copyright.

dbus-python (0.82.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Build HTML API documentation, now that epydoc 3.0 beta is in unstable.
    - Split out a python-dbus-doc package with the HTML and examples
    - Build-Depend on python-epydoc (>= 3.0~beta1)
  * Work around minor upstream build bug by using relative path for srcdir
    (this can be reverted for the next upstream release if desired)

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Wrap build-deps and deps.
  * Add ${misc:Depends}.
  * Add install-clean to .PHONY.
  * Cleanups.
  * Build-dep on autotools-dev for the config.guess and .sub automatic update.
  * Use XS-Python-Version instead of debian/pyversions.
  * Use classical CFLAGS.
  * Add watch file.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

  * Package examples, including those referenced by the tutorial
    (Closes: #416714, #368286)
  * Include the Academic Free License version 2.1, not 2.0, in
    debian/copyright, since that's what the dual license includes.
    Closes: #408372 - the duplicated lines in the GPL header also mentioned
    in that bug have already been fixed upstream.

    also Closes: #409754.

  * New upstream release
    - build system is now autotools
    - install a header file for external mainloops (not bothering with a
      separate -dev package since it's so small)
    - debian/control, debian/rules: build HTML documentation with
      python-docutils
  * Convert debian/rules to do a series of autotools builds, one per version
    (based on debian/rules from pygobject)
  * Drop dependency on libxml2 (no longer needed upstream)
  * Recommend python-gobject (or python-gtk < 2.10 for those with the

dbus-python (0.80~rc2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate with changed API:
    - dbus_bindings rewritten in C with improved API, and renamed to
      _dbus_bindings, leaving behind a partial emulation stub
      (note: this may break applications that were using it
      directly, but this was never meant to be supported)
    - exported-method parameters, proxy-method return values, signal-handler
      parameter types are now unambiguous
    - there is no longer a Variant type, just a variant_level attribute
      on the D-Bus types
    - generalized main-loop integration (only for native-code main loops
      so far)
  * Remove Build-Depends on Pyrex (no longer used upstream)

  * debian/libdbus-qt4-1-dev.install: Also install the dbuscpp2xml and
    dbusidl2cpp utilities
  * debian/session.conf
    + Install a custom dbus session.conf. In the generated one some variables
    aren't expanded, causing the session bus to fail (Closes: #374747)
  * Move libdbus-1-2 to sections libs
  * Let libdbus-1-2 recommend dbus. Almost all libdbus-1 using applications
    really need the dbus to be present so the recommends is justified.
    (Closes: #374726)
  * debian/libdbus-qt-1-dev.install: Install all the needed header files.

dbus (0.34-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * libdbus-1-cil improvements based on comments from Mirco Bauer
    + Call dh_clideps before dh_makeclilibs
    + libdbus-1-cil can be arch all
    + Use CLI instead of .NET in the package description
  * Add debian/patches/dbus-sessionbus-checkuid.patch:
    - bus/session.conf.in: Do not allow any user to connect to any session bus
      by default.
    - bus/policy.c: "allowed" now defaults to true if the connecting user id
      matches the session bus user id.
    - This stops other users from listening and sending to other user's
      session dbus instances.

 -- Daniel Silverstone <dsilvers@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Jul 2004 14:13:44 +0100

dbus (0.21-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a chown,chgrp to the init script to make sure the pid dir is owned
    by the messagebus user.
  * Modify the dbus-1 init script to remove some arguments from the invocation
    of start-stop-daemon so that it will work when being asked to stop a
    dbus instance which has a different executable to that installed.

 -- Daniel Silverstone <dsilvers@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Jul 2004 21:56:45 +0100

dbus (0.21-5) unstable; urgency=low

    change should ensure we're safe.

    debian-changelog-file-uses-obsolete-national-charset errors from lintian

dbus (0.20-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a touch of usage information to the top of the dbus Xsession.d file.
    Also since we've had confirmation that this file does enough, this version
    closes: #230835
  * Add an extra rm -f $PIDFILE to /etc/init.d/dbus-1 to help on restart.
    closes: #229609
  * Temporarily quiesce error reports in system.d/*.conf files when loading.
    This breaks the standard that the daemon shouldn't start with malformed
    configuration files, but at least for now it seems sensible to do.
    closes: #230231
    NOTE: this is likely to be removed in a future version of dbus after the
    configuration file syntax stabilises. Please report bugs against packages
    which have configs which fail to parse with the latest dbus package.
  
 -- Daniel Silverstone <dsilvers@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Feb 2004 00:46:52 +0000

dbus (0.20-5) unstable; urgency=low

    to get glib-object.h
  * Removed the dbus-qt-1 and dbus-qt-1-dev packages until upstream actually
    do something with the binding (like putting some code into it)

dbus (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Starbucks To Begin Sinister 'Phase Two' Of Operation" release.
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    - Drop "lib*" prefix from all packages, and change suffix from "0" to "-1".
      D-BUS isn't technically just a shared library; it also includes a
      daemon.  This could really go either way; I could just put the daemon
      in the libdbus0 package and be done with it, but I think that's more
      confusing in the end, since people have been very conditioned to
      expect libfoo -> just shared library.
    - Add Conflicts: and Replaces: on older lib* packages.
    - Remove Provides and Conflicts on libdbus-dev in new dbus-1-dev
      package, since they are actually parallel installable.
    - Ditto for libdbus-glib0-dev.
    - Touch up descriptions.
    - Update to Standards-Version: 3.5.9; no changes required.
    - Add libexpat-dev to Build-Depends.
  * debian/dbus0.init:
    - New file; runs the D-BUS daemon.
  * debian/dbus0.default:

  * debian/rocks:
    - Add --with-xml=expat.
    - Update to correspond with changes to debian/control.
    - Make dbus-glib-1 package be built after dbus-1 package.
    - Add debian/dbus-1/usr/lib to DEB_SHLIBDEPS_INCLUDE_dbus-glib-1 so we
      pick up the right shlibs.
  * debian/rules:
    - Update to latest version of Colin's Build System.
