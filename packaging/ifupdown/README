========

ifupdown is a set of utilities to assist with basic interface
manipulation.


Building
--------

To build from Mercurial, you need to generate the tangled sources from the
literate source. To do this, you'll need Norman Ramsey's noweb program
(nowebm.deb for Debian users). The following instructions should be enough
to build from nothing but ifupdown.nw.

	notangle -t8 -RMakefile ifupdown.nw >Makefile
	notangle -Rmakenwdep.sh ifupdown.nw >makenwdep.sh
	chmod 755 makenwdep.sh
	make

After that, you should just need some standard tools like gcc and perl.


Literate Source
---------------

To view the pretty-printed literate source code, you can make any of
the targets:

	ifupdown.ps
	ifupdown.dvi
or	ifupdown.pdf

You'll need a LaTeX distribution to do this, as well as noweb.
