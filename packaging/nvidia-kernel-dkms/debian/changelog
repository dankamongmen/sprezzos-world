nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.60-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Add libxvmcnvidia1 package for the libXvMCNVIDIA*.so.1 library that was
    previously included in libgl1-nvidia-glx. The libgl1-nvidia-glx package
    was split in order to remove the libxvmc1 dependency and make it multiarch
    co-installable.  (Closes: #676723, #685054, #686033, #688714)
  * nvidia-cuda-proxy: New package for nvidia-cuda-proxy-{control,server}.
  * libgl1-nvidia-glx-i386:i386: New M-A: foreign helper package that can be
    recommended by libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32:amd64.  (Closes: #687506)

nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.60-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream long lived branch release 304.60 (2012-10-18).
    - Fixed a bug that caused the EIZO FlexScan SX2762W monitor to remain blank
      when connected via DisplayPort.
    - Fixed a bug that caused applications to stop rendering or the X server to
      hang in Xinerama configurations when windows were moved, resized, mapped,
      or unmapped.
    - Fixed a bug that caused poor OpenGL performance on GeForce 6 and 7 PCI
      cards.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if a display was put into
      DPMS off mode and subsequently re-enabled while screen transformations
      are in use.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X Resize and Rotate extension to be enabled
      when Xinerama is enabled.  These two X extensions are incompatible and
      having them both enabled can confuse window managers such as KDE's kwin.
      RandR is now correctly disabled when Xinerama is enabled.
    - Fixed a bug causing OpenGL stereo applications to not work properly
      when using passive stereo modes 5 through 9 on Quadro Fermi and newer
      GPUs.
    - Added support for the "Backlight" RandR output property for
      configuring the brightness of some notebook internal panels.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the Ubuntu Unity launcher panel from
      unhiding: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1057000
    - Fixed a bug that caused incorrect input transformation after resizing
      an NVIDIA X screen with xserver ABI 12 (xorg-server 1.12) or newer.
    - Fixed a bug that caused GLX to leak memory when Xinerama is
      enabled.
  * Upload to unstable.
  * Restrict watch file to releases from the 304.xx long lived branch.
  * libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386: Breaks: ia32-libs (<< 1:0), versioning was fixed.
  * Fix missing legacy substitution.
  * Revert libxvmc1 dependency downgrade HACK.
  * libgl1-nvidia-glx: Stop shipping libXvMCNVIDIA*.so.1 to avoid dependency
    on libxvmc1 (which is not yet converted to multiarch, see #640499), making
    libgl1-nvidia-glx multiarch co-installable.
  * conftest.h:
    - Implement checks for linux/efi.h and linux/nvmap.h (310.14).
    - Implement new conftest.sh functions outer_flush_all, nvmap_support, and
      efi_enabled (310.14).

      transformations such as rotation and keystone correction are in use.
    * Closes: #688660.
  * Update nv-readme.ids.
  * Upload to experimental

nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.48-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32: readd Depends: libgl1-nvidia-alternatives-ia32 to
    prevent apt from removing libgl1-nvidia-alternatives-ia32 (which would
    remove the diversions) while the old (pre-transitional)
    libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32 is still installed.  (Closes: #688659)

nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream long lived branch release 304.37 (2012-08-13).
    - Removed the ability to enable SLI on GPUs with ECC enabled.
    - Fixed several bugs that prevented some RandR transform geometries from
      being applied.
    - Fixed a bug that caused frequent hangs or crashes on some systems.
      (Closes: #686092, #667684)
    - Fixed a bug that would cause corruption and performance issues in certain
      OpenGL applications such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent on GeForce 6 and 7
      GPUs.
  * New upstream release 295 series.
    * CVE-2012-4225  (Closes: 684781)
    - Implemented hotfix for a privilege escalation vulnerability reported on
      August 1, 2012.  For more details, see:

nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.32-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 304.32 (2012-08-03).
    - Fixed a bug that caused applications that use DirectColor visuals, such as
      Enemy Territory: Quake Wars and Braid, to appear in shades of blue instead
      of the correct colors.  (Closes: #683758)
    - Modified handling of RRSetScreenSize requests to ignore requests that
      do not actually resize the screen.  This reduces screen flicker in certain
      cases when using GNOME.

    (Closes: #683678)

 -- Andreas Beckmann <debian@abeckmann.de>  Fri, 03 Aug 2012 13:41:12 +0200

nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.30-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 304.30 (2012-07-30).
    - Added support for xserver ABI 13 (xorg-server 1.13).
    - Added support for RandR per-CRTC gamma manipulation through the
      RandR 1.2 RRGetCrtcGammaSize, RRGetCrtcGamma, and RRSetCrtcGamma
      requests.
    - Fixed a bug that caused RRSetOutputPrimary requests to incorrectly
      generate BadValue errors when setting the primary output to None.  This
      caused gnome-settings-daemon to crash after changing the screen
      configuration in response to a display hotplug or the display change
      hot-key being pressed.
    - Fixed a problem where RENDER Glyphs operations would exhibit severe
      performance issues in certain cases, such as when used with gradients
      by Cairo and Chromium.
    - Fixed a bug that caused X to hang when resuming certain DisplayPort
      display devices (such as Apple brand mini-DisplayPort to dual-link DVI
      adapters) from power-saving mode.
    - Added support for the following GPU: Tesla K10.
    - Fixed a bug that caused an X screen to be extended to Quadro SDI Output
      devices by default.  An X screen will still use an SDI Output device if
      it is the only display device available.  To use a SDI Output device on
      an X screen with other display devices available, include the SDI Output
      device with either the "UseDisplayDevice" or "MetaMode" X configuration
      options.
    - Updated X11 modeline validation such that modes not defined in a
      display device's EDID are discarded if the EDID 1.3 "GTF Supported"
      flag is unset or if the EDID 1.4 "Continuous Frequency" flag is
      unset.  The new "AllowNonEdidModes" token for the ModeValidation
      X configuration option can be used to disable this new check.
    - Fixed a bug, introduced in the 295.xx release series, with EDID
      detection on some laptop internal panels.  This bug caused the
      laptop internal panel to show six small copies of the desktop.
      (Closes: #681453)
    - Added support for FXAA, Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing.
  * Update nv-readme.ids.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * xserver-xorg-video-nvidia.postrm: Do not fail if the debconf templates
    from nvidia-support are not available.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.22-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 304.22 (2012-07-13).
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTX 680M, Quadro K1000M,
      Quadro K2000M.
    - Enhanced the functionality of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X
      configuration option:
      + Implicit MetaModes will be added for the primary display device,
        even if multiple display devices are in use when X is initialized.
      + Implicit MetaModes will be added for common resolutions, even
        if there isn't a mode with that resolution in the mode pool of
        the display device.
      + Extended the syntax of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X
        configuration option, e.g., to control which display device is
        used for creation of implicit MetaModes.
      See the description of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X configuration
      option in the README for details.
    - Modified the handling of the RandR 1.0/1.1 requests RRGetScreenInfo
      and RRSetScreenConfig (e.g., `xrandr -q --q1` and `xrandr --size ...`
      and `xrandr --orientation ...`) such that they operate on MetaModes.
      This was the behavior in NVIDIA X driver versions 295.xx and
      earlier, but 302.xx releases altered the handling of these RandR
      1.0/1.1 requests to operate on a single RandR output's modes.
    - With the above changes to IncludeImplicitMetaModes and RandR 1.0/1.1
      handling, fullscreen applications (e.g., SDL-based applications,
      Wine), should have more resolutions available to them, and should
      interact better with multiple monitor configurations.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause G8x, G9x, and GT2xx GPUs to display a black
      screen or corruption after waking up from suspend.  (Closes: #679577)
    - Fixed several bugs that could cause some OpenGL programs to hang
      when calling fork(3).
    - Fixed an nvidia-settings bug that caused the results of ProbeDisplays
      queries made with the --display-device-string option to be formatted
      incorrectly.
    - Improved the responsiveness of updates to the nvidia-settings
      control panel when displays are hotplugged.
    - Fixed a bug that caused display corruption when setting some
      transforms, especially when panning a transformed display.
    - Fixed a bug that caused extra RandR events to be generated the first
      time a display is hotplugged.
    - Fixed a bug that caused X11 modelines with '@' in their names to
      be rejected.
    - Added support for DisplayPort 1.2 branch devices, which allow multiple
      displays to be connected to a single DisplayPort connector on a graphics
      board.
    - Fixed a bug that caused most OpenGL texture uploads to be slow when
      the context was bound rendering to an RGB overlay drawable.
    - Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work after restarting
      the X server on some MCP7x (IGP) GPUs.
    - Updated the X configuration option "UseDisplayDevice" to honor the
      value "none" on any GPU.
    - Added support for DKMS in nvidia-installer. Installing the kernel
      module through DKMS allows the module to be rebuilt automatically
      when changing to a different Linux kernel. See the README and the
      nvidia-installer help text for the "--dkms" option.
    - Added RandR output properties _ConnectorLocation, ConnectorNumber,
      ConnectorType, EDID, _GUID, and SignalFormat.  See the README for details
      on these properties.
    - Extended support for Base Mosaic to all G80+ SLI configurations with up
      to three displays.
    - Fixed a bug that caused some monitors to fail to wake from DPMS suspend
      mode when multiple DisplayPort monitors were attached to one GPU.
    - Removed controls for XVideo attributes from the "X Server XVideo
      Settings" page of the nvidia-settings control panel. XVideo attributes
      can be configured in XVideo player applications, or through utilities
      such as xvattr.
    - Fixed a bug that caused all ports on an XVideo adaptor to share
      color correction settings.
    - Removed support for the following X configuration options:
         SecondMonitorHorizSync
         SecondMonitorVertRefresh
       Similar control is available through the NVIDIA HorizSync and
       VertRefresh X configuration options.  Please see the NVIDIA driver
       README for details.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro from working
      properly when switching between X servers on different VTs.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (302.17-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 302.17 (2012-06-15).
    - Made nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder consistent with the RRSetOutputPrimary
      and RRGetOutputPrimary RandR requests: changes to either
      nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder or RandR OutputPrimary will be reflected in
      the other.
    - Fixed an interaction problem between RandR 1.2, ConstrainCursor,
      and panning that prevented panning from working properly.
    - Fixed a bug that caused RandR RRNotify_CrtcChange events to not
      be generated when switching between MetaModes with the same total
      size but different layout of display devices.  This bug caused
      some window managers to not update their layouts in response to
      switching same-sized MetaModes.
    - Added support for desktop panning when rotation, reflection,
      or transformation is applied to a display device (either through
      RandR or through the MetaMode syntax); panning would previously be
      ignored in that case.
    - Added an "EDID" property to RandR 1.2 outputs.  This property contains the
      binary contents of the connected monitor's extended display identification
      data, which allows applications such as the GNOME display properties
      dialog to query information about it.
    - Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work on some GPUs
      after querying the RandR configuration (e.g., `xrandr -q`).
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfo" X configuration option to report
      the layout of multiple display devices within an X screen.  This is
      enabled by default.  When disabled on X servers with RandR 1.2
      support, the NVIDIA X driver will report one screen-sized region.
      When disabled on X servers without RandR 1.2 support, no Xinerama
      information will be reported.  For backwards compatibility, the
      "NoTwinViewXineramaInfo" option disables nvidiaXineramaInfo.
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder" X configuration option as
      a replacement for "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder".  For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder" is kept as a synonym for
      "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder".
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride" X configuration option as
      a replacement for "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride".  For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride" is kept as a synonym
      for "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride".
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the use of some SLI Mosaic topologies.
    - Added the "MetaModeOrientation" X configuration option as a
      replacement for "TwinViewOrientation".  "TwinViewOrientation"
      is kept as a synonym for "MetaModeOrientation", for backwards
      compatibility.

    - Added support for calculating the physical size and DPI of each
      RandR 1.2 Output using the EDID Detailed Timing Description.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented a workaround for the invalid EDID in certain
      AUO laptop flat panels from being applied, leading to an 800x600 desktop
      repeated several times across the screen.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the link configuration of DisplayPort devices to
      be reported incorrectly in nvidia-settings.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (302.07-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 302.07 (2012-05-02).
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL programs to leak file descriptors
      when calling exec() on themselves.
    - Fixed rendering corruption at the start of new X server generation.
      (Closes: #651155)
    - Added X driver support for RandR 1.2 and RandR 1.3.  See "Support
      for the X Resize and Rotate Extension" in the README for details.
    - Extended the MetaMode X configuration option syntax with the
      following new attributes:
        "Rotation"    : specifies the display device's rotation
        "Reflection"  : specifies the display device's reflection
        "Transform"   : specifies a 3x3 transformation matrix to be
                        applied to the display device
        "ViewPortOut" : specifies the region of the mode in which to
                        display pixels
        "ViewPortIn"  : specifies the size of the region in the X screen
                        to display in the ViewPortOut
      For example, "DFP-0: nvidia-auto-select { Rotation=left }".
      See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README for details.
    - Removed the "TwinView" X configuration option; the functionality
      it provided is now enabled by default.
      Previously, the NVIDIA X driver only enabled one display device
      for an X screen unless "TwinView" was enabled.  Now, the NVIDIA
      X driver enables, by default, as many display devices as the
      GPU supports driving simultaneously.  To limit how many display
      devices are driven by an X screen, use the "UseDisplayDevice"
      X configuration option.
    - Added a "CurrentMetaMode" attribute to the nvidia-settings command
      line, to query and set the current MetaMode.
      As an example, these two commands are equivalent:
        xrandr --output DVI-I-2 --mode 1280x1024 --pos 0x0 \
               --output DVI-I-3 --mode 1920x1200 --pos 1280x0
        nvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=\
                "DVI-I-2: 1280x1024 +0+0, DVI-I-3: 1920x1200 +1280+0"
    - Removed overscan compensation configurability from NV-CONTROL and
      nvidia-settings. This can be configured, with finer granularity,
      through the ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut MetaMode attributes.
      See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README for details.
    - Altered mode validation such that for digital display devices
      the X driver only allows, by default, modes which are reported in
      the EDID.  Previously, the NVIDIA X driver allowed other modes,
      but implicitly scaled those other modes to one of the EDID modes.
      Now, only the modes in the EDID are validated and the X driver
      does not do any implicit scaling.  Any desired scaling can be
      configured explicitly through the new "ViewPortIn" and "ViewPortOut"
      MetaMode attributes.  See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices
      on One X Screen" in the README for details.
    - Removed Flat Panel Scaling configurability in nvidia-settings.
      Any desired scaling can be configured through the new "ViewPortIn"
      and "ViewPortOut" MetaMode attributes.
    - Hotplug events (specifically, the RRNotify_OutputChange RandR
      event) are now generated when display devices are connected and
      disconnected from the GPU.  Many desktop environments automatically
      resize the X desktop in response to these events.
    - Added display device name aliases, such that X configuration options
      that use display device names can refer to a display device by one of
      several names, including the RandR Output name for the display
      device.  The X log reports the list of aliases for each display device.
    - Updated EDID parsing to include more complete support for EDID 1.4
      and more recent versions of CEA-861.
    - Removed the "Rotate" X configuration option.  This was used to
      statically rotate the X screen.  Its functionality is replaced by
      the "Rotation" MetaMode attribute and RandR 1.2 rotation support.
      See the README for details.
    - Removed the "RandRRotation" X configuration option.  This enabled
      configurability of X screen rotation via RandR 1.1.  Its functionality
      is replaced by the "Rotation" MetaMode attribute and RandR 1.2
      rotation support.  See the README for details.
    - Removed support for the following NV-CONTROL attributes:
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_DEFAULT_TARGET
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_DEFAULT_METHOD
        NV_CTRL_DFP_SCALING_ACTIVE
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_ACTIVE
        NV_CTRL_FRONTEND_RESOLUTION
        NV_CTRL_BACKEND_RESOLUTION
        NV_CTRL_OVERSCAN_COMPENSATION
        NV_CTRL_FLATPANEL_BEST_FIT_RESOLUTION
    - Improved rendering performance for RENDER bitmap text.
    - Enabled the OpenGL "Sync to VBlank" option by default.
    - Expose the following additional FSAA modes via NV-CONTROL,
      nvidia-settings, and through X visuals and GLXFBConfigs:
        16X multisample FSAA on all GeForce GPUs
        Coverage sample FSAA on G80 and above GeForce GPUs
        32X multisample FSAA on G80 and above Quadro GPUs
        64X multisample FSAA on Fermi and above Quadro GPUs
    - Enabled conformant texture clamping by default in OpenGL.
    - Removed support for the GVO Clone mode NV-CONTROL attributes:
        NV_CTRL_GVO_DISPLAY_X_SCREEN
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_X
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_Y
    - Updated the NVIDIA X driver's handling of X configuration options
      that affect an entire GPU, not just a particular X screen running
      on a GPU (e.g., "NoPowerConnectorCheck"): for such X configuration
      options, the X driver will now honor the option on any of the X
      screens configured on the GPU.  Prior to this change, the NVIDIA
      X driver only honored such options on the first X screen configured
      on a GPU.
    - Added a checkbox to nvidia-settings to control the texture clamping
      attribute.  When the box is checked, OpenGL textures are clamped
      according to the OpenGL specification.  When it is unchecked, GL_CLAMP
      is remapped to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE for borderless 2D textures.
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Update symbols control files.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (290.03-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 290.03 (2011-10-21).
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the driver from loading on some systems with 
      integrated graphics.
    - Fixed issues in VDPAU that prevented allocating and displaying extremely
      large VdpOutputSurfaces.
    - Added support for limiting heap allocations in the OpenGL driver through
      the use of the __GL_HEAP_ALLOC_LIMIT environment variable.  See the README
      for further details.
    - Added an "Accel" option to the X driver to allow disabling its use of the
      graphics processing hardware.  This is useful when other components, such
      as CUDA, require exclusive use of the GPU's processing cores.
    - Modified how the OpenGL driver allocates executable memory so it may
      continue to function properly if /tmp is mounted noexec. As some fallback
      allocation methods may be prohibited under SELinux policy, the driver now
      supports detection of this policy as well as manual override of this
      detection via the __GL_SELINUX_BOOLEANS environment variable.
    - Fixed a bug that caused various GLSL built-in uniforms to not
      be updated properly when calling glPopAttrib.
    - Improved performance by caching compiled OpenGL shaders to disk. Added a
      "GLShaderDiskCache" option to the X driver to enable/disable this
      feature. Added the __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE and __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH
      environment variables for further configuration. See the README for
      further details.
  * New upstream long-lived branch release 275.36 (2011-11-04).
    - Added support for the following GPU: GeForce 510.
    - Fixed a bug that caused trapezoid and triangle rendering to be very slow
      on older GPUs with xorg-server 1.11.  (Closes: #642757 and 15 dupes)
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Update nv-readme.ids.
  * Refresh use-nv-kernel.o.ARCH.patch.
  * bug-control: collect information about installed nouveau packages.

  * Update bug-script to list files in the new private directory as well as in
    multiarch directories.
  * Enable multiarch build.
    - Add Multi-Arch: same/foreign/allowed.
    - Use compat level 9.
    - Work around missing multiarch support in libvdpau1.

      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_NV_framebuffer_multisample_coverage
      GL_NV_texture_barrier
    - Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extension:
      GL_NV_register_combiners2
    - Fixed a bug that caused the pop-out and external DVI displays to go blank
      on Lenovo ThinkPad W701 laptops.
    - Fixed a bug that caused corruption on the menus in OpenOffice.org when the
      screen is rotated.
    - Improved performance of certain memory allocations.
    - Fixed a bug that caused Java2D widgets to disappear when Java is
      configured to render using FBOs.
    - Added a new X configuration option "BaseMosaic" which can be used to
      extend a single X screen transparently across all of the available
      display outputs on each GPU. See "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the
      README for more information.
    - Fixed a bug causing incorrect reporting of GPU core and ambient
      temperatures via NV-CONTROL.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (270.41.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream release 270.41.19 (2011-05-20).
    - Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause 1
      second hangs when transitioning from blit-based display to overlay-
      based display. This would most commonly happen when disabling a
      compositing manager.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when capturing SDI video.
    - Fixed a corner-case in which the OpenGL driver could leak resources
      in applications utilizing fork().
    - Addressed a Linux kernel interface compatibility problem that could
      lead to ioremap() errors and, potentially, functional and/or
      stability problems.
    - Fixed a bug that caused SLI initialization to fail on some Intel
      based systems.
    - Fixed a bug that caused SLI initialization to fail when using recent
      Linux kernels, such as 2.6.38.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Partially merge 195.36.31-91 (UNRELEASED).
    - Drop nvidia-kernel-compat-2.6.38.patch and adjust conftest.h to mark
      aquire_console_sem as no longer available in 2.6.38 and newer kernels.
      This avoids different behaviour between the kernel modules built from
      upstream installer and the Debian packages.
    - Add avoid-ld.gold.patch to explicitly link with ld.bfd.  The kernel
      module built with ld.gold does not work properly.
      (Closes: #625761, #626279)
    - Drop dependency on nvidia-common in favor of nvidia-installer-cleanup.
    - Convert nvidia-vdpau-driver{,-ia32} related versioned Conflicts/Replaces
      to Breaks/Replaces.
    - Turn nvidia-glx-ia32 into a transitional package, the libraries have
      been shipped in libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32 for quite some time.
    - Add support for arch-specific overrides (lintian 2.5.0).
    - Let the triggers only create the alternatives to diverted libraries if
      the diverted file is a symbolic link and points to an actual file.  This
      avoids failures running the triggers on some systems with broken
      diverted files.  (Closes: #626399)
    - Perform the same validation and correction of the diverted symlinks in
      libgl1-nvidia-alternatives and libgl1-nvidia-alternatives-ia32.
    - Add Depends: nvidia-support to nvidia-glx.  The new support package
      ships the nvidia-bug-report.sh manpage.
    - Override the binary-without-manpage lintian warning now that we provide
      a manpage (in nvidia-support).
    - conftest.h: implement conftest.sh function ioremap_cache (270.41.19).

nvidia-graphics-drivers (270.41.06-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream release 270.41.06 (2011-04-20).  (Closes: #624644)
    - Fixed a bug that caused some GPUs to stop responding when the X Server
      was started. All GPUs are susceptible, but the failure was primarily
      seen on GF104 and GF106 boards.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: Tesla M2090, Tesla M2075,
      Tesla C2075, Quadro 7000.
  * New upstream beta 270.41.03 (2011-04-18).
    - Fixed a bug causing the X server to hang every 49.7 days on 32-bit
      platforms.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GT 520, GeForce GT 520M,
      GeForce GT 525M, GeForce GT 530, GeForce 405, GeForce GT 420,
      GeForce GT 440, GeForce GT 445M, GeForce GT 550M, GeForce GT 555M,
      GeForce GTX 470M, GeForce GTX 485M, GeForce GTX 550 Ti, GeForce GTX 590,
      NVS 4200M, Quadro 1000M, Quadro 2000M.
  * Upload to unstable.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Refresh use-nv-kernel.o.ARCH.patch and fix-typos.patch.
  * Partially merge 195.36.31-91 (UNRELEASED).
    - Update to Standards-Version: 3.9.2.
    - Override the experimental lintian tag shlib-calls-exit (libGL.so.*).
    - Support backport specific operations in debian/rules by setting the
      BACKPORT variable in debian/rules.defs.
    - Set the supported Xorg ABIs in debian/rules.defs, use substvars for Xorg
      related Depends/Provides, compute the values in debian/rules.
      Add compatibility settings for old Xorg versions for backports only.
    - Add #LIBDIR# and #PRIVATE# substitution variables for generated control
      files.
  * Add nvidia-installer-cleanup as an alternative to nvidia-common.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (270.30-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream beta 270.30 (2011-03-02).
    - Added support for xserver ABI 10 (xorg-server 1.10).
  * New upstream beta 270.29 (2011-02-24).
  * New upstream beta 270.26 (2011-02-15).  (Closes: #616353)
    - Added NV-CONTROL event notification for NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_READY
      status changes.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTX 560 Ti.
    - Added a new X configuration option "Interactive", which defaults to
      enabled, but can be disabled to allow long-running GPU compute programs
      to run concurrently with X.
    - Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause VDPAU
      "display preemption" when rendering to tiny or zero-sized windows or
      pixmaps.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU which prevented use of the overlay presentation
      queue following an application exiting without gracefully destroying its
      VDPAU presentation queue.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented the overlay from ever being used if
      a presentation queue was created while the target window was redirected
      using the Composite extension when the presentation queue was created.
  * New upstream beta 270.18 (2011-01-21).
    - Reorganized the NVIDIA driver's /proc file system layout to better
      reflect current needs: /proc/driver/nvidia/cards/0..N has been
      moved to /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0..N/information
    - Added new shared library: libnvidia-ml.so.
      NVML provides programmatic access to static information and monitoring
      data for NVIDIA GPUs, as well as limited managment capabilities. It is 
      intended for use with Tesla compute products.
      See web-based documentation and associated nvml.h header for more info.
    - Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionDisplayType" to specify
      the display type when NVIDIA 3D Vision is enabled with a non
      3D Vision ready display.
    - Fixed several bugs relating to hardware-accelerated gradients, which were
      causing visual corruption in some of the default Ubuntu GNOME themes.
  * New upstream beta 265 series.
    - Modified colormap updates to no longer be synchronized to vblank.  This
      allows applications to send XStoreColor and XStoreColors requests faster
      than the screen's refresh rate.
      This behavior can be controlled by a new NV-CONTROL attribute,
      NV_CONTROL_SYNC_LUT_UPDATES.  By default, LUT updates are not
      synchronized.  This may cause flickering in some applications that use the
      colormap to perform animation, such as xpilot running on a depth 8 X
      screen.  If you experience flickering, try running
          nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/SynchronousPaletteUpdates=1
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Refresh use-nv-kernel.o.ARCH.patch.
  * Add package libnvidia-ml1 for the NVIDIA management library (NVML), a new
    library added by upstream.
  * Alternatively depend on xorg-video-abi-10.
  * Let nvidia-vdpau-driver Conflicts/Replaces the obsolete transitional
    package nvidia-libvdpau-dev.
  * Merge 195.36.31-90 (UNRELEASED).

nvidia-graphics-drivers (260.19.44-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream release 260.19.44 (2011-03-07).
    (Closes: #607430, #610755, #612136)
    - Updated the NVIDIA X driver to not update mode timings for G-Sync
      compatibility when NVIDIA 3D Vision or NVIDIA 3D VisionPro is
      enabled along with a G-Sync device.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: Quadro 2000 D, Quadro 400.
  * New upstream release 260.19.36 (2011-01-21).
    - Updated the NVIDIA kernel module to ensure that all system memory
      allocated by it for use with GPUs or within user-space components of the
      NVIDIA driver stack is initialized to zero.  (Closes: #609338)
      A new NVIDIA kernel module option, InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations,
      allows administrators to revert to the previous behavior.
    - Fixed a bug that caused X servers version 1.9 and higher to crash when
      color index overlays were enabled.
    - Fixed a bug that caused pixel value 255 to be treated as transparent in
      color index overlays.
    * Fix deadlock in some applications that fork.  (Closes: #612998)
  * New upstream release 260.19.29 (2010-12-13).
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTX 460 SE,
      GeForce GTX 570, Quadro 5000M, NVS 300.
    - Fixed a bug that caused some OpenGL applications to become
      unresponsive for up to a minute on some GPUs when changing
      the resolution or refresh rate.
    - Added support for NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro.
      See the "Stereo" X configuration documentation in the README
      for further details.
    - Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionProConfigFile"
      to allow user provide a filename which NVIDIA X driver uses
      to store 3D Vision Pro configuration settings.
      See "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the README for
      more information.
  * Merge 195.36.31-7.
  * Remove NVIDIA_kernel-260.19.34-778465.diff, applied upstream.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.
  * Detect license changes by comparing debian/copyright with the shipped
    LICENSE during build.
  * Pre-Depend on nvidia-common for interactive (using debconf)
    nvidia-installer cleanup.  There is a mutual exclusion between using the
    nvidia-installer and the driver packages.
    - Checks for /usr/bin/nvidia-installer and asks the user whether to run
      'nvidia-installer --uninstall'.  If that fails, offers to just delete
      the remaining files.  If the user chooses to do the cleanup himself,
      installation is blocked as long as nvidia-installer is still found on
      the system.  (Closes: #605337, #611705)
    - Adds a pre-install hook for the nvidia-installer, giving a warning to
      users running a NVIDIA-Linux-*.run file directly while Debian packages
      providing the driver are installed.  This hook fails intentionally, but
      unfortunately the default choice if the hook failed is to continue
      anyway.  Therefore the hook tries to kill the nvidia-installer process.
    - Provides a script that checks for conflicting libraries (libGL.so.*.*
      remaining from previous usage of the nvidia-installer) and offers to
      delete them.  The script is intended to be run from postinst.  If the
      user chooses not to delete them, postinst configure fails as long as the
      user has not cleaned up or lets the postinst delete the files.
  * nvidia-glx{,-ia32}.postinst: run the cleanup of conflicting libGL.so.*.*
    (Currently the conflicting libraries are moved to
    /var/lib/nvidia-backup.XXXXXX instead of deleting them.) (Closes: #606175)
  * Install a dummy file in /usr/lib/nvidia/diversions to ensure it is not
    removed by some old maintainer script.  Causes trouble if the destination
    directory of some diversion is missing and the diverted file is installed
    later on.  (Closes: #608625)
  * Add patch nvidia-kernel-compat-2.6.38.patch to fix build with 2.6.38-rc
    kernels.  (Closes: #613798)
  * Depend on xorg-video-abi-8 without minor version (Closes: #612956) and
    provide xorg-driver-video to match what Xorg 1.9 provides and expects.
  * Add script build-module-packages.sh to the documentation of the
    nvidia-kernel-source package, uses module-assistant to do a quick build of
    the modules for all installed linux-headers.
  * Prevent concurrent installation of mismatching upstream versions of
    libgl1-nvidia-glx and libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32.  (Closes: #614040)
  * Catch module-assistant failures after nvidia-kernel-source updates without
    running 'module-assistant clean nvidia'.  Only works if the old version
    already contained this change and a module was built.
  * Use dpkg-parsechangelog to extract the upstream version number from
    debian/changelog, simplifying debian/rules.defs even more.
  * Update lintian-overrides to work with lintian 2.5.0.
  * Add patch fix-typos.patch to fix a typo in the module (found by lintian).
  * Drop Conflicts: binutils-gold, the problem is no longer reproducible with
    binutils-gold 2.21.0.20110302-2 and driver 260.19.44 or 195.36.31, so
    either the driver or gold was fixed inbetween.  (See #581336)

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Readd the Lintian overrides for the old embedded library tags, since
    part of the ftp-master verification process seems to be using an older
    Lintian.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (260.19.21-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream release 260.19.21 (2010-11-11).  (Closes: #603754)
    - Fixed a race condition in OpenGL that could cause crashes with
      multithreaded applications.
    - Fixed a bug that may cause OpenGL applications which fork to crash.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that caused it to attempt allocation of huge
      blocks of system memory. This regression was introduced in the
      260.* driver series.
  * New upstream release 260.19.12 (2010-10-13).
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTS 450, GeForce GTX 460M,
      GeForce GT 415M, GeForce GT 425M, GeForce GT 420M, GeForce GT 435M,
      Quadro 2000, Quadro 600.
    - Fixed the CustomEDID X configuration option so that it can handle
      EDID files from Linux procfs; e.g., /proc/acpi/video/IGPU/LCD0/EDID.
  * New upstream release 260.19.06 (2010-09-15).
    - Fixed an interaction problem with a change in X server behavior that
      caused slow text rendering on X.Org xserver 1.9.
    - Enhanced VDPAU to support interop with CUDA and OpenGL when Xinerama
      is active.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented temporal-spatial de-interlacing from
      operating when temporal de-interlacing was not also enabled.
    - Added support for configuring the dithering depth used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.
  * New upstream release 260.19.04 (2010-09-08).
    - Added support for the nvcuvid API.
      nvcuvid provides a mechanism for decoding video and exposing the
      surfaces to CUDA, allowing applications to perform custom processing of
      the video. nvcuvid is primarily targeted at transcoding and video-
      processing applications. nvcuvid was already available on other
      platforms.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause a "display preemption" when
      toggling MPlayer to full-screen the first time.
    - Added OpenGL 4.1 support for Quadro Fermi, GeForce GTX 4xx, and
      later GPUs.
    - Enhanced VDPAU to fully support Xinerama.
    - Fixed a bug in the X driver that prevented operation of Xinerama when
      using multiple NVIDIA GPUs from different major hardware generations
      on X with ABI 4 or greater.
    - Fixed a bug in the OpenGL driver's Xinerama support.
      Rendering should have ocurred to all physical X screens driven by an
      NVIDIA GPU compatible with the NVIDIA GPU driving physical X screen 0.
      However, if some physical X screen did not satisfy that requirement,
      then not only would that physical X screen not be rendered to (as
      expected), but also all physical X screens with a higher number would
      not be rendered to (which was unexpected).
    - Added GPU "Processor Clock" reporting to the nvidia-settings PowerMizer
      page.
    - Implemented support for SLI Mosaic Mode on Quadro FX 5800 and
      Quadro Fermi and newer Quadro GPUs.
    - Enhanced the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue to allow it to be
      used when SLI is active, and in some cases when the X composite
      extension is enabled. See the README for further details.
    - Added support for configuring the dithering mode used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.
    - Added support for configuring individual displays as any eye in passive
      stereo mode "4" when using TwinView or SLI Mosaic through extensions to
      the MetaMode syntax.
    - Added ColorSpace and ColorRange features for HDMI. These give
      the ability to output YUV over HDMI and select full/reduced
      color range on RGB over HDMI. ColorSpace and ColorRange
      are X Configuration options and can be changed dynamically
      through nvidia-settings.
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Merge 195.36.31-6.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.
  * Drop 2.6.36-ioctl.patch, fixed upstream.
  * conftest.h: implement new (after 195.xx) conftest.sh functions
    pci_dma_mapping_error, scatterlist, pci_domain_nr, file_operations,
    sg_init_table.  Kernel versions of symbol (dis-)appearance from lxr.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Update lintian overrides.
  * libnvcuvid1: new package for the nvcuvid library added upstream.
  * Xorg 1.9 is supported since 256.53: add xorg-video-abi-8.0 as alternative
    dependency and stop providing xserver-xorg-video-6.  (Closes: #603755)

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Merge 195.36.31-4, 195.36.31-5.
  * Stop shipping CUDA and OpenCL headers.  NVIDIA will stop including them in
    the 260.xx release.  The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (which is the only user of
    these header files) already contains them and is the recommended source
    for these header files.
  * Drop libcuda1-dev and nvidia-libopencl1-dev packages, move libOpenCL.so
    link to nvidia-libopencl1.  libcuda1 and nvidia-libopencl1 Conflicts and
    Replaces their old -dev packages for clean upgrades without transitionals.
  * NOTE to packagers of software that uses NVIDIA CUDA and/or OpenCL: use
    Build-Depends: nvidia-cuda-dev and/or nvidia-opencl-dev or
    nvidia-cuda-toolkit.  If a certain OpenCL API is required, add versioned
    B-D on opencl-headers, e.g (<< 1.1) for API 1.0 or (>> 1.1) for API 1.1.
  * Drop transitional packages that were released with squeeze:
    - nvidia-glx-dev (now Conflicts/Replaces by libgl1-nvidia-glx)
    - nvidia-libvdpau1{,-ia32}, nvidia-libvdpau-dev
    - libnvidia-compiler1{,-ia32}
      (now Conflicts/Replaces by libnvidia-compiler{,-ia32}).
  * Lower Priority of *-ia32 packages to extra (debcheck).
  * Switch default Section to non-free/libs with a few exceptions: x11
    (nvidia-glx), utils (nvidia-smi), kernel (nvidia-kernel-{source,dkms}),
    oldlibs (nvidia-glx-ia32).

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Use /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build as the default kernel build location
    for nvidia-kernel-source instead of /usr/src/linux, since this is set
    up automatically by the current linux-headers-* packages.
  * In the nvidia-kernel-source documentation, remove mention of setting
    KVERS, which should no longer be needed, and mention that setting KSRC
    is optional if the build link exists and you're building for the
    currently running kernel.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (195.36.31-92) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Merge diversions, alternatives and multiarch changes from 275xx releases:
  * Switch to multiarch-aware diversion and alternatives handling provided by
    the glx-diversions/glx-alternative-nvidia packages.
  * Move handling of alternatives from nvidia-glx and libgl1-nvidia-glx to
    nvidia-alternative (new package) and glx-alternative-nvidia (from
    glx-alternatives).  libGL.so.1 and libglx.so (the Xorg module) no longer
    can be configured independently, avoiding possible mixed NVIDIA/MESA
    setups.
  * Convert old packages libgl{1,x}-nvidia-alternatives to transitional ones.
  * Note: The diversion and alternative handling of
    libgl1-nvidia-{glx,alternatives}-ia32 is not being changed.
    These packages will become obsolete by adding multiarch support.
  * Split the Xorg driver and modules from nvidia-glx into new package
    xserver-xorg-driver-nvidia (package name agreed by Cyril Brulebois).
  * Install the following files that exist in both current and legacy drivers

    libXvMCNVIDIA.so.1, libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so.1, nvidia-bug-report.sh.
  * Do the same with libnvidia-tls.so.1, tls/libnvidia-tls.so.1 and
    libGLcore.so.1 which are only supplied by the legacy packages.
  * The 'nvidia' alternative (set up by package nvidia-alternative{,-legacy-*})
    handles creation of appropriate symlinks in /usr/lib/nvidia.
  * The 'glx' alternative (set up by package glx-alternative-nvidia) handles
    creation of appropriate symlinks in /usr/lib, /usr/lib/xorg, etc.
  * Convert the Conflicts: *-legacy-*, fglrx-* to versioned Breaks: as the
    library and driver parts should be co-installable by now.  There still can
    be only one nvidia-*-dkms package installed at a time as they all generate
    the same kernel module: nvidia.ko.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (195.36.31-91) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Merge general changes from 270xx/275xx releases:
  * Update to Standards-Version: 3.9.2.
  * Drop nvidia-kernel-compat-2.6.38.patch and adjust conftest.h to mark
    aquire_console_sem as no longer available in 2.6.38 and newer kernels.
    This avoids different behaviour between the kernel modules built from
    upstream installer and the Debian packages.
  * Add no-smp_lock.patch to remove the superfluous inclusion of
    linux/smp_lock.h (kernel_locked is not used anywhere, so this seems to
    be bitrot).  That header is no longer available in 2.6.39-rc4, so this
    patch fixes build with the kernel in experimental.
  * Add avoid-ld.gold.patch to explicitly link with ld.bfd.  The kernel
    module built with ld.gold does not work properly.
  * Add linux3.patch to make the module build on linux-3.0.
  * Add nvidia-installer-cleanup as an alternative to nvidia-common.
  * Drop dependency on nvidia-common in favor of nvidia-installer-cleanup.
  * Add Pre-Depends: nvidia-installer-cleanup to nvidia-kernel-dkms.
  * Convert nvidia-vdpau-driver{,-ia32} related versioned Conflicts/Replaces
    to Breaks/Replaces.
  * Turn nvidia-glx-ia32 into a transitional package, the libraries have
    been shipped in libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32 for quite some time.
  * Let the triggers only create the alternatives to diverted libraries if
    the diverted file is a symbolic link and points to an actual file.  This
    avoids failures running the triggers on some systems with broken
    diverted files.
  * Perform the same validation and correction of the diverted symlinks in
    libgl1-nvidia-alternatives and libgl1-nvidia-alternatives-ia32.
  * Add Depends: nvidia-support to nvidia-glx.  The new support package
    ships the nvidia-bug-report.sh manpage.
  * conftest.h:
    - Implement conftest.sh function ioremap_cache (270.41.19).
    - Implement checks for generated/compile.h and generated/utsrelease.h
      (275.09).
  * Let nvidia-opencl-icd{,-ia32} depend on libnvidia-compiler{,-ia32},
    OpenCL code usually requires compilation at runtime.
  * Support backport specific operations in debian/rules by setting the
    BACKPORT variable in debian/rules.defs.
  * Set the supported Xorg ABIs in debian/rules.defs, use substvars for Xorg
    related Depends/Provides, compute the values in debian/rules.
    Add compatibility settings for old Xorg versions for backports only.
  * Drop lintian 2.4.3 compatibility overrides.
  * Convert lintian-overrides to use [arch lists] introduced in lintian 2.5.1.
  * Generate some *-ia32.lintian-overrides by swapping [i386] and [amd64].
  * Fall back to the old version of nvidia.ids if extract-pci-ids.sh failed.
  * Remove support for restoring the upstream layout used up to 195xx.
  * Canonicalize the location of upstream's README.txt, NVIDIA_Changelog and
    kernel module source path.
  * Add Conflicts: lib{*}-ia32 [i386] to lib{*} to prevent mixing multiarch
    and biarch packages, e.g. lib{*}:i386 and lib{*}-ia32:amd64 on amd64.
  * Add XS-Autobuild: yes to debian/control.  See instructions in #602838.
  * Add #MAJOR# substitution variable.
  * Add #LIBDIR# and #PRIVATE# substitution variables for generated control
    files.

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Add DM-Upload-Allowed: yes to debian/control.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (195.36.31-90) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Merge general changes from 256xx/260xx releases:
  * Use dpkg-parsechangelog to extract the upstream version number from
    debian/changelog, simplifying debian/rules.defs even more.
  * Drop Conflicts: binutils-gold, driver or gold was fixed.
  * Detect license changes by comparing debian/copyright with the shipped
    LICENSE during build.
  * Catch module-assistant failures after nvidia-kernel-source updates without
    running 'module-assistant clean nvidia'.  Only works if the old version
    already contained this change and a module was built.
  * Add script build-module-packages.sh to the documentation of the
    nvidia-kernel-source package, uses module-assistant to do a quick build of
    the modules for all installed linux-headers.
  * Install a dummy file in /usr/lib/nvidia/diversions to ensure it is not
    removed by some old maintainer script.  Causes trouble if the destination
    directory of some diversion is missing and the diverted file is installed
    later on.
  * conftest.h: implement new (after 195.xx) conftest.sh functions
    pci_dma_mapping_error, scatterlist, pci_domain_nr, file_operations,
    sg_init_table.  Kernel versions of symbol (dis-)appearance from lxr.
  * Pre-Depend on nvidia-common for interactive (using debconf)
    nvidia-installer cleanup.  There is a mutual exclusion between using the
    nvidia-installer and the driver packages.
    - Checks for /usr/bin/nvidia-installer and asks the user whether to run
      'nvidia-installer --uninstall'.  If that fails, offers to just delete
      the remaining files.  If the user chooses to do the cleanup himself,
      installation is blocked as long as nvidia-installer is still found on
      the system.
    - Adds a pre-install hook for the nvidia-installer, giving a warning to
      users running a NVIDIA-Linux-*.run file directly while Debian packages
      providing the driver are installed.  This hook fails intentionally, but
      unfortunately the default choice if the hook failed is to continue
      anyway.  Therefore the hook tries to kill the nvidia-installer process.
    - Provides a script that checks for conflicting libraries (libGL.so.*.*
      remaining from previous usage of the nvidia-installer) and offers to
      delete them.  The script is intended to be run from postinst.  If the
      user chooses not to delete them, postinst configure fails as long as the
      user has not cleaned up or lets the postinst delete the files.
  * nvidia-glx{,-ia32}.postinst: run the cleanup of conflicting libGL.so.*.*
    (Currently the conflicting libraries are moved to
    /var/lib/nvidia-backup.XXXXXX instead of deleting them.)
  * Use /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build as the default kernel build location
    for nvidia-kernel-source instead of /usr/src/linux, since this is set
    up automatically by the current linux-headers-* packages.
  * In the nvidia-kernel-source documentation, remove mention of setting
    KVERS, which should no longer be needed, and mention that setting KSRC
    is optional if the build link exists and you're building for the
    currently running kernel.
  * Stop shipping CUDA and OpenCL headers.  NVIDIA will stop including them in
    the 260.xx release.  The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (which is the only user of
    these header files) already contains them and is the recommended source
    for these header files.
  * Drop libcuda1-dev and nvidia-libopencl1-dev packages, move libOpenCL.so
    link to nvidia-libopencl1.  libcuda1 and nvidia-libopencl1 Conflicts and
    Replaces their old -dev packages for clean upgrades without transitionals.
  * NOTE to packagers of software that uses NVIDIA CUDA and/or OpenCL: use
    Build-Depends: nvidia-cuda-dev and/or nvidia-opencl-dev or
    nvidia-cuda-toolkit.  If a certain OpenCL API is required, add versioned
    B-D on opencl-headers, e.g (<< 1.1) for API 1.0 or (>> 1.1) for API 1.1.
  * Lower Priority of *-ia32 packages to extra (debcheck).
  * Switch default Section to non-free/libs with a few exceptions: x11
    (nvidia-glx), utils (nvidia-smi), kernel (nvidia-kernel-{source,dkms}),
    oldlibs (nvidia-glx-ia32).
  * Drop transitional packages that were released with squeeze:
    - nvidia-glx-dev (now Conflicts/Replaces by libgl1-nvidia-glx)
    - nvidia-libvdpau1{,-ia32}, nvidia-libvdpau-dev
      (now Conflicts/Replaces by nvidia-vdpau-driver{,-ia32})
    - libnvidia-compiler1{,-ia32}
      (now Conflicts/Replaces by libnvidia-compiler{,-ia32}).
  * Prevent concurrent installation of mismatching upstream versions of
    libgl1-nvidia-glx and libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32.
  * Provide xorg-driver-video.
  * Add patch nvidia-kernel-compat-2.6.38.patch to fix build with 2.6.38
    kernels.
  * Add patch fix-typos.patch to fix a typo in the module (found by lintian).
  * Update lintian-overrides to work with lintian 2.5.0.  Keep error overrides
    compatible with older lintian releases until ftp-master is updated.

  * If both original and diverted file exist when removing obsolete
    diversions, move the original file (which is not owned by any package) out
    of the way.  This problem may originate from incorrect diversion creation
    before lenny (and was not noticed or fixed in lenny) or having used the
    nvidia installer to install the driver in the past.  (Closes: #600327)
  * Add a NEWS entry recommending to update all pre-squeeze nvidia packages
    before switching to a -legacy- variant.  (Closes: #596843)
  * Update gdm/kdm insufficient timeout NEWS entry: mention xdm (no workaround
    needed) and that kdm was fixed in 4:4.4.5-4.
  * Document the warnings emitted by the maintainer scripts in README.Debian.
  * Install the upstream README.txt in the dkms package.  It is referenced by
    the package description.  Add a README.Debian, too.  (Closes: #602733)

  * Drop Breaks: xserver-xorg-core (<< 2:1.6).
    There is no file name conflict between /usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1 (from
    NVIDIA) and /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libGLcore.so (only in
    xserver-xorg-core << 2:1.6) that could cause the wrong library to be
    loaded by NVIDIA's libgl.so.
  * Change xserver dependency to 'xorg-video-abi-6.0 | xserver-xorg-core
    (<< 2:1.7.7)' as the driver is supposed to work with older abi versions,
    too.  This is not needed for squeeze, but helps backports to lenny.
  * Add Pre-Depends: libc6-i386 (>= 2.9-18) to all packages handling files in
    /usr/lib32.
  * Restrict nvidia-opencl-common Recommends: nvidia-opencl-icd-ia32 to amd64.
  * libgl1-nvidia-alternatives needs to Breaks: old nvidia-glx*-dev packages,
    some were shipping a libGL.so symlink which may cause problems on partial
    upgrades.
  * libgl*-nvidia-alternatives* needs to Depends: dpkg (>= 1.15) for using

  * New upstream release.
    - Drop patch NVIDIA_kernel-195.36.24-682377.diff, now included.
  * Update nvidia.ids.
  * Fix the dpkg-shlibdeps generation of packages built while nvidia-glx is
    installed: add back a special shlibs entry for libGL.so.1 and remove
    libGL.so.1 from the symbols file to ensure to generate a dependency on
    libgl1-mesa-glx | libgl1 only.  (Closes: #587091)
  * Install libGL.so* in /usr/lib{,32}/nvidia/ and use alternatives to handle
    /usr/lib{,32}/libGL.so.1 and /usr/lib{,32}/libGL.so.
  * Split the nvidia-glx{,-ia32} packages, move the runtime libraries to
    libgl1-nvidia-glx{,-ia32}.  (Closes: #369316)
    Since we use alternatives to replace the diverted files we can migrate
    the diversions in postinst instead of preinst to simplify updates.
  * Rename package nvidia-glx-dev to libgl1-nvidia-dev (add dummy package).
  * Introduce virtual packages nvidia-glx{,-ia32}, libgl1-nvidia-glx{,-ia32},
    libgl1-nvidia-dev, nvidia-kernel-dkms.  Add a matching Provides/Conflicts:
    to the corresponding real packages, so that the legacy packages can do the
    same and we can stop listing each variant we have in Conflicts and
    Recommends lists.
  * Add Conflicts: fglrx-driver, fglrx-glx, fglrx-glx-ia32.
  * nvidia-glx: install HTML variant of the README, too.
  * Update to Standards-Version: 3.9.1.  Not switching to Breaks+Replaces.
    Not touching old versioned Conflicts.  No other changes needed.
  * Rename the libnvidia-compiler1 packages to libnvidia-compiler.  The
    library is actually a (fairly huge) plugin used by libcuda1 (with the
    same upstream version) only.  It has currently no SONAME and starting with
    256.xx upstream will add a SONAME including the current upstream version.
    To avoid renaming the package for every new upstream release the SOVERSION
    will be dropped from the package name.  Add transitional packages.
  * Update lintian-overrides and minor cleanup of the packaging scripts.
  * Clean up more carefully after the module build.
  * Move diversions to /usr/lib{,32}/nvidia/diversions.
  * Remove possible LEGACY part from virtual package name
    nvidia-kernel-NVIDIAVERSION (provided by the kernel module).
  * Add a new substvar for marking the special driver from the NVIDIA Perfkit.
  * Add helper script debian/extract-pci-ids.sh to extract the PCI IDs of
    supported devices from nv-kernel.o.  Based on the nvidia_supported script
    found in Ubuntu's nvidia-current package.  Refresh nv-kernel.ids.
  * Add new package nvidia-smi for the NVIDIA System Management Interface (a

nvidia-graphics-drivers (195.36.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * New upstream release.  (Closes: #571674, #575457, #575550, #578589)
  * Add an nvidia-kernel-dkms package which builds the kernel module using
    DKMS and hence automatically does the right thing with kernel upgrades
    (provided the module builds).  (Closes: #334848, #395226, #528758)
  * Overhaul the build system in nvidia-kernel-source to not require
    module-assistant, be more robust in its derivation of the kernel
    version, and embed the kernel package version in the module package
    version.  Recommend nvidia-kernel-common since it's a dependency of
    the generated module package.  Remove the unnecessary recommendation
    of devscripts.  (Closes: #254859, #279182, #303521, #368669, #473378)
    (Closes: #523879, #534535)
  * nvidia-kernel-<version> now only recommends linux-image-<version>
    instead of depending on it, allowing the package to be used with
    hand-built kernels not installed as regular packages.
  * Build the tarball for nvidia-kernel-source directly in the staging
    directory rather than using dh_install to install it elsewhere and do
    that as a dh_auto_install override.  This simplifies creation of the
    nvidia-kernel-dkms package.
  * All packages that suggested nvidia-kernel-source now suggest
    nvidia-kernel-dkms as an alternative.

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * do not ship empty directory in module package
  * debian.binary/rules, debian.binary/install.template: use dh_install to
    install the module

    nvidia-graphics-modules-i386
  * include a copy of the NVIDIA changelog in the module packages built from
    nvidia-kernel-source
  * install the changelog from the nvidia-kernel-source package, too, if
    building via nvidia-graphics-modules
  * nvidia-kernel-source: bump debhelper dependency to 7 to match module
    packaging templates
  * merge debian.binary/copyright with debian/copyright.in
  * debian/control:
    - drop versioned Depends/Build-Depends satisfied in lenny
    - drop Conflicts/Replaces for packages existing before lenny only
  * TLS cleanup: Debian only ships TLS enabled 2.6 kernels, so remove all
    dynamic TLS checking and symlink updating code (closes: #394085)
    - nvidia-glx.README.Debian: don't talk about TLS any longer
    - debian/nvidia-glx.init: remove (inactive) tls symlink adjusting code
    - debian/nvidia-glx.default: remove, no longer needed
    - nvidia-glx.postinst: remove /etc/default/nvidia-glx on upgrades

    version and hardware information
  * debian/control: bump debhelper B-D to (>= 7.2.3~) for dh_bugfiles
  * debian/rules: use dh_bugfiles to install bug script
  * Create symlinks NVIDIA-Linux{-i386,-amd64,} pointing to the extracted
    upstream archives to reduce #DIRNAME# and $(dirname_*) usage. (Using
    wildcards is not a good idea since beta releases use a different naming
    scheme.)
  * debian/*.in: replace #DIRNAME# with NVIDIA-Linux and rename *.in to * if
    this was the only substitution
  * patches/*, patches.save/*, patches.dpatch.save/*: remove, long obsolete
  * debian/rules: remove obsolete code
  * debian/upstream_info, debian/rules: simplify
    - add URL_X86 and URL_X86_64, include both URLs in debian/copyright
    - drop unused variables BASE_VERSION, FILENAME, DIRNAME, URL, RELEASE,
      UPSTREAMVERSION, NEXTVER
  * conftest.h: implement conftest.sh function acpi_walk_namespace (new in
    195.xx), acpi_walk_namespace is available since 2.4.0 (checked with lxr)
  * conftest.h: reorder and make INIT_WORK implementation more complete
  * debian.binary/control.template: rename to *.in
  * debian/rules: use same variable substitutions as for debian/*.in to create
    debian.binary/control.template
  * debian/rules: rename target build-kernel-stamp to module-source-stamp,
    reindent, simplify and unify; do not require root for building the tarball

    dependencies
  * debian/rules: remove unused stamp files, targets and variables

    - remove code deactivated before etch release
    - remove diversion transition and cleanup code introduced before etch
      release
    - remove libwfb.so diversion cleanup code introduced before lenny release
  * nvidia-glx: stop diverting /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libGLcore.so,
    was removed in Xorg 1.6, add Breaks: xserver-xorg-core (<< 2:1.6) instead
  * nvidia-glx: stop diverting files not seen in etch or later:
    - /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libGLcore.a
    - /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.a
  * nvidia-glx: clean up diversion of /usr/lib/libGL.a (was not being created
    in etch or later), the file is provided by libgl1-mesa-swx11-dev which
    conflicts with nvidia-glx
  * remove empty maintainer script nvidia-glx-dev.preinst.in

    installation
  * debian/*.dirs: remove or minimize
  * debian/rules: reindent and simplify

  * debian/changelog, debian/*.README*: whitespace cleanup
  * move files: debian.binary/ ==> debian/module/debian/,
    Makefile, conftest.*, patches.h ==> debian/module/
  * debian/rules: adjust for debian/module/
  * switch to source format 3.0 (quilt)
  * debian/module/debian/: set source format 1.0, the module source "package"
    is shipped as .tar.bz2 and unpacked with tar, therefore no newer features
    can be used
  * conftest.h: ensure the macros from linux/version.h are available
  * debian/module/debian/patches/conditionally-include-linux_version.h.patch:
    new patch, ensure linux/version.h is included only once (that header does
    not have include guards)
  * debian/README*: remove reference to http://people.debian.org/~rdonald
  * remove Randall Donald from Uploaders per his request
  * debian/control:
    - remove dependency on x11-common, probably remained from the X11R6 time
    - reformat, synchronize, use more substvars
    - add Conflicts with nvidia-glx-legacy-* packages
    - reorder packages for better logical grouping
  * install the bug-script in all packages as well as in the binary modules
    packages built from nvidia-kernel-source
  * replace shell script debian/upstream_info with makefile fragment
    debian/rules.defs
  * debian/rules, debian/README.source: add new target get-orig-source and
    simplify instructions for tarball creation:
    uscan --report && dch -v <version> && debian/rules get-orig-source
  * fix-2.6.33-build.patch: remove, fixed by upstream in 195.36.24
  * libcuda1.symbols: update for symbol changes in 195.xx
  * nvidia-kernel-source.README.Debian: mention dkms and m-a before everything
    else, drop some very outdated information
  * debian/rules.defs, debian/rules: add variable/placeholder LEGACY
    and new subst vars nvidia:Legacy and nvidia:LegacyDesc

nvidia-graphics-drivers (190.53-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Set urgency to high for RC bug fixes.
  * Add Conflicts and Replaces for the fix in 190.53-3 to the
    nvidia-*vdpau*-ia32 packages.  (190.53-2 installed files in
    the opposite package as was intended.)  (Closes: #577059)
  * Remove postinst for generated module packages.  This script used to
    set up the NVIDIA device files in /dev, but this is now handled by
    nvidia-kernel-common.
  * Remove empty postrm from generated module packages.
  * Tell update-rc.d to only start the nvidia-glx script and not create
    stop links, matching the LSB script header.  (Closes: #577055)
  * Make nvidia-kernel-source depend on module-assistant.  At least for
    right now, it uses the make fragments provided by module-assistant to
    implement required rules for the module building interface.
  * Make all Lintian overrides for binary problems that the license
    doesn't allow us to fix (unstripped shared libraries, executable
    stack, non-PIC code, etc.) general rather than referring to specific
    files.  We won't be able to fix these in any files they turn up in.
    This allows us to use static Lintian override files and stop
    substituting version numbers into them in debian/rules, simplifying
    the build process.
  * Add some additional Lintian overrides for nvidia-glx for the weirdness
    we need to partly replace the free libGL libraries.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (190.53-3) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Andres Mejia ]
  * Fix weak library dependency of dev packages.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4.
  * Include Copyright line in copyright file. Copyright line was taken from
    cuda.h header file.
  * Place updated NVIDIA license in copyright file.
  * Fix file permissions in installed files.
  * Fix installation of libvdpau_nvidia.so.* for nvidia-vdpau-driver-ia32
    package.
  * Add myself to Uploaders field in answer to bug #568952.

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Set urgency to high for RC bug fixes.  The version currently in
    testing is not usable with the X server in testing.
  * Do not run configure under $(ROOT_CMD) in kdist_config.  kdist_build
    already runs that target under $(ROOT_CMD), so this provokes errors
    from fakeroot about nesting invocations.  Nothing this target does
    requires fakeroot.  Thanks, Bastian Kleineidam.  (Closes:  #416594)
  * nvidia-glx-dev should depend on libx11-dev since GL/glx.h includes
    headers from it.  Thanks, Baruch Even.  (Closes: #433178)
  * Do not remove /usr/lib/libGL.so on purge of nvidia-glx.  At that
    point, we've removed our diversion, so this is someone else's file and
    we shouldn't be deleting it.
  * Remove our diversions on aborted installations of nvidia-glx, since we
    may have gotten far enough to create them.
  * Document the nvidia-glx postrm cases and rationale in more detail in
    comments in the postrm.  Thanks, Sven Joachim.  (Closes: #575272)
  * Stop stripping the binaries.  The NVIDIA license does not allow us to
    modify the binaries in any way.
  * Stop generating debian/control and risking that the rules to do so may
    fire during a normal package build.  The only variable being
    substituted into the generated debian/control was the NVIDIA version,
    and that only in binary package stanzas.  Instead, generate an
    ${nvidia:Version} substvar with that value and use that substvar in
    debian/control.
  * Force source format 1.0.  The interaction of the packaging and the
    upstream source is way too complicated to figure out how to move to
    3.0 (quilt) at this point.
  * Add a preliminary README.source explaining how to import new upstream
    versions and build the package for upload.
  * Add an explanation for the non-free placement of this package to
    debian/copyright as requested by Policy 12.5.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]

  symlinks after the init script is called.  (closes: #208198)

nvidia-graphics-drivers (1.0.4496-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian.binary/rules used the -a flag to copy the control.template file
    to debian-binary/control. If the former was a symlink, this would result

    also be a symlink to the same file. Removed the -a, now it works just
    fine.
