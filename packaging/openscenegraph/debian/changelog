    fine.
  * Removed openthreads-doc since OpenThreads documentation is shared with
    OpenSceneGraph's, hence this package was empty.

openscenegraph (2.8.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed problem in armel, failing to build due to linking problems.

    - debhelper-but-no-misc-depends
    - out-of-date-standards-version (updated from 3.8.0 to 3.8.4)
    - patch-system-but-no-source-readme
    - dh-clean-k-is-deprecated (using 'dh_prep' instead of 'dh_clean -k')
    - manpage-has-bad-whatis-entry (trick to avoid warning and get whatis
      program working, removing related overrides as said above)

openscenegraph (2.4.0-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * No longer try to detect (using /proc/cpuinfo when available) how many
    CPUs are available, fixing the FTBFS (due to -j0) on various platforms
    (Closes: #477353). The right way to do it is to support parallel=n in
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS (see Debian Policy §4.9.1), and adequate support has
    been implemented.
  * Add patch to fix FTBFS due to the build system now refusing to handle
    whitespaces (Policy CMP0004 say the logs), thanks to Andreas Putzo who
    provided it (Closes: #482239):
     - debian/patches/fix-cmp0004-build-failure.dpatch

openscenegraph (2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Update debian/patches/openscenegraph.dpatch accordingly.
  * Fix installation of .so according to the SONAME bump:
     - debian/libopenscenegraph6.files still contained libosg*.so.6*
       references, which are now bumped. That problem was introduced in
       2.1.9-1.
  * Move from dh_movefiles to dh_install:
     - debian/*.files renamed as debian/*.install.
     - use “dh_install --sourcedir=debian/tmp” instead of “dh_movefiles”.
     - remove the previous “dh_install -p openscenegraph” call accordingly.
     - modify debian/rules to copy OpenSceneGraph/examples under debian/tmp,
       and update debian/openscenegraph.install accordingly.
     - also use “--fail-missing” to catch files not installed anywhere, and
       avoid the kind of errors mentioned above.
  * Add lintian override:
     - located under debian/lintian/, the only one being there is for
       libopenscenegraph6, which holds multiple shared objects.
     - adapted debian/rules a bit to install it (eventually them) easily.
  * Adjust clean rule:
     - upstream ships an executable C++ source file, which permission is
       removed in the clean target.
  * Adjust manpages (debian/*.1):
     - use “\-\-help” instead of “--help” to fix hyphen-used-as-minus-sign
       reported by lintian.
     - add osgdepthpeeling.1 to MANEXAMPLES.

  * Disabled patch (merged upstream):

  * Refreshed patch (context modified due to changed version numbers):
     - openscenegraph.dpatch
  * Cleanup:
     - commented out unused "version" and "major" variable in debian/rules.
     - replaced "Source-Version" with "binary:Version" in debian/control to
       make the packages binNMU-safe.
