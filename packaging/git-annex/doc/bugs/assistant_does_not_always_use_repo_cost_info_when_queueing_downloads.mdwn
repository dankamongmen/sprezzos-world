git-annex has nice repository cost tracking, but the assistant doesn't
always use this when queuing downloads.

For example, if a network comes up, it'll queue a lot of downloads from a
remote, perhaps expensive server. If a removable drive is then attached,
which has a lower cost, it'll queue downloads from there, but
only once it works through all the ones it's already queued from the
network.

There is a workaround: Since the webapp allows disabling syncing to a
remote, the user can go in and disable syncing to the network remote
temporarily.
