Description: fast indexing and searching tool for your personal data (daemon)
 Strigi is a program for fast indexing and searching your personal data. It can
 gather and index information from files in the filesystem even if they are
 hidden in emails or archives. It comes with a Qt4 GUI, an HTML GUI and a KDE
 GUI.
 .
 Main features:
  * very fast crawling
  * very small memory footprint
  * no hammering of the system
  * clucene backend
  * DBus and socket interfaces are available for communication between daemon
    and search programs
  * simple interface for implementing plugins for extracting information. we'll
    try to reuse the kat plugins, although native plugins will have a large
    speed advantage
  * calculation of sha1 for every file crawled (allows fast finding of
    duplicates)
 .
 This package contains the Strigi daemon

Replaces: strigi-daemon (<< 0.3.11-1)
Description: command-line tools for Strigi Desktop Search
 This package is part of Strigi Desktop Search, it contains utilities powered
 by Strigi:
  * deepfind, an enhanced version of find. It lists files embedded in other
    files like .deb, .rpm, .tar.gz, email attachments, and other files.
  * deepgrep, an enhanced version of grep. It searches in binary files like
    OpenOffice files, mp3s, Microsoft office files, pdfs and also in files
    embedded in other files like .deb, .rpm, .tar.gz, email attachments, pdf
    and other files.
  * xmlindexer, a program that outputs the file parsing results as xml.
    It walks through a directory and outputs an XML file containing all
    the metadata and text it can extract from the files it encounters.
    This means that the Strigi's powers of data extraction are now available
    to all applications that can parse XML simply by calling xmlindexer and
    parsing the output.
 .
