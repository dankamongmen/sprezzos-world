Description: lightweight connectivity tracking library
 ntrack aims to be a lightweight and easy to use library for application
 developers that want to get events on network online status changes such as
 online, offline or route changes.
 .
 The primary goal is to serve desktop applications in a network manager and
 desktop environment independent fashion. Also its supposed to be lightweight,
 resource un-intensive and extensible.
 .
 ntrack currently comes with bindings for glib, GObject, qt4 and python-gobject.
