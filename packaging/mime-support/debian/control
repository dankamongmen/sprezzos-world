Description: MIME files 'mime.types' & 'mailcap', and support programs
 As these files can be used by all MIME compliant programs, they
 have been moved into their own package that others can depend upon.
 .
 Other packages add themselves as viewers/editors/composers/etc by
 using the provided "update-mime" program.
 .
 In addition, the commands "see", "edit", "compose", and "print"
 will display, alter, create, and print (respectively) any file using
 a program determined from the entries in the mime.types and mailcap
 files.
