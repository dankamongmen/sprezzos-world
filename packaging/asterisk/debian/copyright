DFSG Compliance
===============
Upstream tarball contains AST.txt and AST.pdf which are licensed under
the terms of of CC-BY-NC-ND, and has thus been removed from the tarball.

A number of other files were removed due to practical considerations
(mostly large sound files that we already include in separate source
package and are not really part of the source in the version control,
thus reducing the size of the source tarball from 27MB to 10MB).

   This package is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

Public License version 2 can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.

The contents of the file "LICENSE" in the source tree:
    Asterisk is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2
    and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly
    with Digium, Inc. If you obtained Asterisk under the GPL, then the GPL
    applies to all loadable Asterisk modules used on your system as well,
    except as defined below. The GPL (version 2) is included in this
    source tree in the file COPYING.
    
    This package also includes various components that are not part of
    Asterisk itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directory
    and its subdirectories. These components are also distributed under the
    GPL version 2 as well.
    
    Digium, Inc. (formerly Linux Support Services) holds copyright
    and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the Asterisk
    package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability
    for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary or
    Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may be dynamically linked at
    runtime with the portions of Asterisk which fall under our
    copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible
    licenses than GPL.
    
    If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry --
    there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your
    GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for Asterisk we
    would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).
    
    Specific permission is also granted to link Asterisk with OpenSSL, OpenH323
    and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit and distribute the resulting binary files.
    
    In addition, Asterisk implements two management/control protocols: the
    Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and the Asterisk Gateway Interface
    (AGI). It is our belief that applications using these protocols to
    manage or control an Asterisk instance do not have to be licensed
    under the GPL or a compatible license, as we believe these protocols
    do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the GPL. However,
    should any court or other judiciary body find that these protocols do
    fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license to
    use these protocols in combination with Asterisk in external
    applications licensed under any license you wish.
    
    The 'Asterisk' name and logos are trademarks owned by Digium, Inc.,
    and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies. If you
    wish to use these trademarks for purposes other than simple
    redistribution of Asterisk source code obtained from Digium, you
    should contact our licensing department to determine the necessary
    steps you must take. For more information on this policy, please read:
