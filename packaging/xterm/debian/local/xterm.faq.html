  <h2 id="what_is_it-id"><a name="what_is_it" id="what_is_it">What
  is <strong>XTerm</strong>?</a></h2>

  <p>From the manual page:</p>

  <blockquote>
    The xterm program is a terminal emulator for the X Window
    System. It provides DEC VT102/VT220 and selected features from
    higher-level terminals such as VT320/VT420/VT520 (VTxxx). It
    also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot
    use the window system directly. If the underlying operating
    system supports terminal resizing capabilities (for example,
    the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), xterm will
    use the facilities to notify programs running in the window
    whenever it is resized.
  </blockquote>

  <p>That is, xterm (pronounced "<em>eks</em>-xterm") is a
  <em>specific</em> program, not a generic item. It is the standard
  X terminal emulator program.</p>

  <p>This FAQ presents various useful bits of information for both
  the specific program as well as other programs that imitate
  it.</p>

  <h2 id="who_did_it-id"><a name="who_did_it" id="who_did_it">Who
  wrote <strong>XTerm</strong>?</a></h2>

  <p>I've been working on xterm since early 1996 (see my <a href=
  "xterm.log.html">changelog</a> for details).</p>

  <p>But the program is much older than that.</p>

  <p>A lot of people, cited at the bottom of the manual page wrote
  the original xterm program, maintained by the X Consortium (later
  part of the Open Group &ndash; I'm well aware of the distinction,
  but am citing when the work was done, not who the current owner
  may be). There is no changelog, and it is not clear who did what.
  Email from Jim Gettys provides some background:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Cast of thousands...

    <p>To give a bit of history, xterm predates X!</p>

    <p>It was originally written as a stand-alone terminal emulator
    for the VS100 by Mark Vandevoorde, as my coop student the
    summer that X started.</p>

    <p>Part way through the summer, it became clear that X was more
    useful than trying to do a stand alone program, so I had him
    retarget it to X. Part of why xterm's internals are so
    horrifying is that it was originally intended that a single
    process be able to drive multiple VS100 displays. Don't hold
    this against Mark; it isn't his fault.</p>

    <p>I then did a lot of hacking on it, and merged several
    improved versions from others back in.</p>

    <p>Notable improvements include the proper ANSI parser, that
    Bob McNamara did.</p>

    <p>The Tek 4010 support came from a guy at Smithsonian
    Astrophysical Observatory whose name slips my mind at the
    moment.</p>

    <p>Ported to X11 by Loretta Guarino.</p>

    <p>Then hacked on at the X Consortium by uncounted people.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Email from Doug Mink provides more background:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I was checking out the newly revised AltaVista search engine to
    see what was on the net about xterm, and I found your pages. I
    can add to the FAQ in that I was the "guy at the Smithsonian
    Astrophysical Observatory" Jim Gettys refers to. I am listed at
    the end of the man page under authors. What happened was that I
    was hired by SAO (after leaving the research staff at MIT) in
    October 1985 to write analysis software for the Spacelab 2
    Infrared Telescope which was to fly on the Space Shuttle in
    1985 less than six months after I was hired. I came with a tar
    tape full of software I had written for Unix and Tektronix
    terminals, but I was presented with a VS100 terminal which had
    an early version (X6 or so) of xterm, with no graphics
    capabilities. SAO is at Harvard, across Cambridge from MIT,
    where Jim Gettys was detailed from DEC to the X project, and
    Jim had connections with SAO, having worked here after college
    (MIT, where we had both worked at the observatory at various
    times); he was still sharing an apartment with an SAO colleague
    of mine, too. Anyway, everyone decided that since I knew
    Tektronix commands pretty well, and our group desparately
    needed the graphics capabilities, it would be a good use of my
    time to implement a Tektronix terminal emulator under X. So I
    set to work learning more C--I had only written a couple of
    wrappers to C I/O routines so I could use them with my Fortran
    software--and wrote a Tektronix emulator. The only X
    documentation at the time was the code itself. While I was at
    it, I wrote an improved Tektronix emulator for our Imagen laser
    printer which used the full resolution of that 300 dpi printer
    instead of the effective 100 dpi (i.e. jaggy) emultator
    distributed with the printer. The original xterm Tek emulator
    shared a window with the VT100 emulator, much like on the VT240
    terminals which I had been using at MIT before I came to
    Harvard. With a VAX 750 running several VS100's, window
    creation was sloowww, so sharing a window was the quickest way
    to do things, and all of my software was written for that mode
    of operation, anyway. While I wrote the emulator so that my
    software would work on it, it was tested by the X group against
    a BBN graphics package, the name of which slips my mind right
    now.

    <p>Anyway, 15 years later, I am still using xterm and some of
    the same mapping software I wrote the emulator for. And I am
    still at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This FAQ is oriented toward the version of xterm originally
  distributed with XFree86 (more commonly known as modern, or "new
  xterm", with a corresponding terminal description "xterm-new"),
  which was based on the X11R6.3 xterm, with the addition of ANSI
  color and VT220 controls.</p>

  <h2 id="what_is_vt220-id"><a name="what_is_vt220" id=
  "what_is_vt220">What is a VT220?</a></h2>

  <h3 id="why_vt220-id"><a name="what_vt220" id="what_vt220">Why a
  VT220?</a></h3>

  <p>The manual page mentions a VT220. Most terminal emulators
  documentation talk about VT100. But a VT100 is a rather limited
  subset of what people expect:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>VT100s have no function keys. Arguably, PF1-PF4 are
    function keys. My keyboard has 12 function keys.</li>

    <li>VT100s do not do <a href=
    "../ncurses/ncurses.faq.html">color</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Initially, I was only interested in making colors workable for
  curses programs.</p>

  <p>Later, I noticed that xterm had some support for what would
  now be termed as ISO-2022. That was a VT220 feature, rather than
  VT100. There were some missing pieces. So I decided to fill in
  those pieces and make xterm a VT220 emulator. (VT220s do not do
  ANSI color either&mdash;the missing pieces were in other
  areas).</p>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> also provides features that are in
  neither VT100 nor VT220, which are used by other programs as
  "xterm emulation".</p>

  <ul>
    <li>set (and retrieve) window- and icon-labels using escape
    sequences.</li>

    <li>interpret mouse clicks as escape sequences that can be read
    by a program.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By the way, the control string used for setting the titles was
  not in a standard format:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In X10 (1988), the string was simply terminated by any
    nonprinting character.</li>

    <li>X11R4 (1989) modified that to ensure that the nonprinting
    character is an ASCII BEL (control/G).</li>

    <li>There is no explanation in the (sketchy) notes distributed
    with the X11R4 xterm; in retrospect it seems that the most
    likely explanation for the choice is that it was simpler to
    implement in shell scripts than <code>ESC&nbsp;\</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I revised that area <a href="xterm.log.html#xterm_24">starting
  in 1996</a>,</p>

  <ul>
    <li>first to use xterm's state table for handling the input,
    and then</li>

    <li>to accept the standard string terminator as well.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="whatis_state_table">What is a State Table?</h3>

  <p>That was mentioned regarding the title strings.
  <strong>XTerm</strong> uses a state machine to handle incoming
  characters. That is essentially what a real terminal does. Other
  "xterm" terminal emulators typically do not do this, which makes
  them not do well with <a href=
  "../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="what_platforms-id"><a name="what_platforms" id=
  "what_platforms">What platforms does it run on?</a></h2>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> runs in all of the implementations of
  X11. I've built and run these since I started working on
  xterm:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>AIX 3.2.5, 4.1, 4.3 (cc)</li>

    <li>Digital Unix 3.2, 4.0, 5.0 (cc)</li>

    <li>FreeBSD 2.2.6 to 6.0 (gcc 2.8)</li>

    <li>HP-UX 9.05 to 11.23 (gcc 2.7.2 to 3.4)</li>

    <li>IRIX 5.2, 6.2 (cc, gcc 2.7.2, gcc 2.8)</li>

    <li>Linux 2.0.0 to 2.6.26 (gcc 2.7.2 to 4.3)</li>

    <li>SCO OpenServer 5 (cc, gcc).</li>

    <li>Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, 8 (cc, gcc 2.7.2)</li>

    <li>SunOS 4.1.1, 4.1.3 (gcc 2.7.2)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The older configurations have X11R5 libraries. Only minor
  changes are needed to make xterm work on those systems. However,
  with X11R6 you can obtain better locale support, as well as new
  features such as the active icon. X11R7... not much to say
  there.</p>

  <h2 id="latest_version-id"><a name="latest_version" id=
  "latest_version">What is the latest version?</a></h2>

  <p>The most recent (and well supported) version of xterm is the
  one that I maintain:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href=
    "ftp://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.tar.gz">current source
    (ftp)</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "http://invisible-island.net/datafiles/release/xterm.tar.gz">current
    source (http)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="other_versions-id"><a name="other_versions" id=
  "other_versions">What versions are available?</a></h2>

  <p>There are several other versions of xterm, based on xterm's
  source. These include</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#bug_ansi_xterm">ansi_xterm</a></li>

    <li><a href="#bug_color_xterm">color_xterm</a></li>

    <li><a href="#bug_kterm">kterm</a> (Japanese)</li>

    <li><a href="#bug_xterm_r6">xterm</a> (from X Consortium)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are similar programs not based on xterm's source, which
  are compatible to different degrees. These include</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#bug_dtterm">dtterm</a></li>

    <li><a href="#bug_emu">emu</a> (from X Consortium)</li>

    <li><a href="#bug_eterm">Eterm</a></li>

    <li><a href="#bug_xgterm">xgterm</a></li>

    <li><a href="#bug_xiterm">xiterm</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some of these use the <a href="#vte_widget">VTE widget</a>.
  Since that supplies most of the terminal emulation, the remaining
  differences between programs using VTE tend to be at the level of
  the window manager (menus, borders, etc.). Other (older) programs
  which are based on reusable widgets include <a href=
  "#bug_dtterm">dtterm</a> and <a href="#bug_emu">emu</a>.</p>

  <p>(I am aware of a few others, such as <strong>xcterm</strong>,
  but have not seen a working version of these).</p>

  <p>Finally of course, there are a multitude of programs which set
  TERM to "xterm", in the hope that applications will treat them
  the same as xterm. For example, PuTTY does this. But its wrapping
  behavior is incompatible with xterm (and any vt100 emulator). You
  can see this in the first menu entry for <a href=
  "../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>.</p>

  <p>Each of the programs noted here which are well-established and
  which are known to differ markedly from xterm have their own
  terminal descriptions in ncurses, to which TERM should be set.
  Otherwise, bug-reports are misdirected to ncurses which should
  have been addressed by the respective developers of these
  programs. <a href=
  "../ncurses/ncurses.html#download_database">ncurses</a>. These
  include</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Eterm</li>

    <li>gnome (obsolete)</li>

    <li>konsole</li>

    <li>mlterm</li>

    <li>mrxvt</li>

    <li>putty</li>

    <li>rxvt</li>

    <li>vte (preferred)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="compare_versions-id"><a name="compare_versions" id=
  "compare_versions">Comparing versions, by counting
  controls</a></h2>

  <p>Several of these programs are claimed (either by their
  developers, or their users) to emulate "most" of xterm. To me,
  "most" would be something quantifiable, e.g., 80 percent. To
  satisfy my curiousity, I wrote a script to extract the control
  sequence information from <a href="#ctlseqs_ms">ctlseqs.txt</a>.
  This counts each control sequence, as well as the variations such
  as setting bold, color, inverse video. Then I (laboriously)
  inspected these terminal implementations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>xterm patch #266 ("xterm-new")</li>

    <li>X11R6.3 xterm (xterm-r6)</li>

    <li>DEC vt220</li>

    <li>DEC vt102</li>

    <li>rxvt 2.7.10</li>

    <li>rxvt-unicode 9.09 (urxvt)</li>

    <li>konsole 2.5.3</li>

    <li>VTE 0.25.91 (vte), used in GNOME-Terminal and kindred.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As of mid-November 2010, these are the latest implementations.
  I included data for the vt220 and vt102 to be able to contrast
  the various terminal <em>emulators</em> against those as well as
  xterm. There are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>498 control sequences listed in the corresponding file for
    xterm patch #266.</li>

    <li>192 of those are "primary", e.g., disregarding parameters
    such as those distinguishing bold from color.</li>

    <li>37 of the primary control sequences have secondary
    sequences.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For each control, there are three possibilities:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>"yes" &mdash; the terminal implements it, matching xterm.
    If xterm implements it, and it is a feature of vt220 or vt102,
    then in turn xterm's behavior must match vt220 or vt102.</li>

    <li>"partial" &mdash; the terminal implements it, but its
    behavior does not match the reference noted above.</li>

    <li>"no" &mdash; the terminal does not implement the
    control.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The control sequences document lists a few controls which
  xterm does not (completely) implement, e.g.,</p>

  <ul>
    <li>key-repeat</li>

    <li>enabling LEDs other than scroll-lock</li>
  </ul>

  <p>None of the other terminal emulators implements those
  either.<br></p>

  </table>

  <p>Modern xterm implements 188 primary controls. In this table,
  konsole ranks last because it does not support vt52 emulation.
  This is not unusual, since the rxvt-based emulators do not,
  either. However, all vt100's provide this feature; programs
  lacking this are not really a vt100 emulator. On the other hand,
  PuTTY (which is not a vt100 emulator due to its incompatible
  wrapping behavior) supports this feature.</p>

  <p>Aside from that, the various emulators implement much the same
  features from xterm. None implements as many as half of xterm's
  controls.</p>

  do I change the font size?</a></h3>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> uses fonts given as resource settings.
  You can switch between these fonts at runtime, using a menu. This
  is documented in the manpage, in the <a href=
  "manpage/xterm.html#MENUS">MENUS</a> section.</p>

  <p>X Consortium xterm provides popup menus, by pressing the
  control key together with the mouse button. Control right mouse
  button pops up the <em>VT FONTS</em> menu, from which you can
  select fonts that are specified in xterm's resources. Usually
  these are in increasing order of size.</p>

  <p>Modern xterm provides the menu, plus a feature adapted from
  rxvt: pressing the shifted keypad plus or minus keys steps
  through the font menu selections, in order of their size.</p>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong>'s manpage does not document the syntax
  for X resources; it is done in the X documentation. If you are
  instead asking about a <a href="#utf8_fonts">problem displaying a
  given font</a>, it may be due to a problem with your resource
  settings.</p>

  <h3 id="how2_print-id"><a name="how2_print" id="how2_print">How
  do I print the screen?</a></h3>

  <p>That depends on why you want to print it.</p>

  <p>If you want a trace of an interactive session, you should use
  the <em>script</em> program. It records every character sent to
  the screen, recording them in a file <code>typescript</code>.
  There are two drawbacks to this approach:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Every character is recorded. Even cursor movement, if you
    run an editor.</li>

    <li>You must start a new shell to capture the
    <code>typescript</code> file.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Well, what about logging? Some versions of xterm support
  logging to a file. In fact modern xterm does. Logging was dropped
  from X Consortium xterm during X11R5 due to security concerns.
  Those were addressed, but logging was not reinstated (in fact
  there is a related <a href="#bug_xterm_r6">bug</a> in xterm).
  Some people prefer this, because it is convenient: you can start
  and stop logging a popup menu entry. However</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Every character is recorded. Even cursor movement, if you
    run an editor.</li>

    <li>Line drawing characters are translated to control
    characters, i.e., codes 0-31 (this may be fixed sometime, it is
    a problem inherited from X Consortium xterm).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Both <em>script</em> and logging are useful for recording, but
  they require interpretation to make sense of the trace. You
  probably would not send that trace to a printer (not twice,
  anyway).</p>

  <p>If you want to print the contents of the screen, modern xterm
  implements, as part of the VT100 emulation, an "attached"
  printer.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The printer is really a pipe command, to which xterm
    writes.</li>

    <li>You can print the current line, page, or continuously with
    the corresponding control sequences. That takes an application
    program which knows how to print the screen.</li>

    <li>If you do not have an application, xterm has a popup menu
    entry to print the window.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are limitations and tradeoffs using the "attached"
  printer, because it is an emulation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The emulation is based on detailed documentation for a
    VT320. This states that control sequences are sent in each line
    to reset bold, underlining and other printable attributes, and
    to set them as needed. Your printer probably does not
    understand this sort of input. Use the xterm resource
    <code>printAttributes</code> to get more easily printed
    output.</li>

    <li>The printer may hang. Not really, but it seems that way. If
    you use the "attached" printer from an application designed for
    the VT100 terminal, it is written with the assumption that the
    printer is a dedicated piece of hardware, printing onto a
    continuous form. Use the <code>printerAutoClose</code> resource
    to change xterm's behavior to close the printer pipe whenever
    the terminal is told to switch the printer offline.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you use the popup menu to print the screen, this will close
  the printer pipe unless it was already opened by the application
  running in xterm.</p>

  <h3 id="how2_fkeys-id"><a name="how2_fkeys" id="how2_fkeys">How
  do I set up function keys?</a></h3>

  <p>With modern xterm, this is relatively simple. So I'll answer
  that first.</p>

  <p>With X Consortium xterm, you had partial support for DEC VTxxx
  function keys. Function keys F1 to F12 correspond to DEC's F1 to
  F12 (sort of). Actually, DEC's VT220 terminals do not have codes
  for F1 through F5. They are reserved for local functions. And the
  VT220 (and up) terminals have 20 function keys. So you cannot do
  anything with the F13 through F20 (i.e., DO, HELP and SELECT).
  Finally, though xterm is reputed to be VT100-compatible, it has
  no support for the VT100 keypad (PF1 to PF4, and the ","
  key).</p>

  <p>Modern (XFree86) xterm changed the X Consortium codes for F1
  to F4 to match the VT100 PF1 to PF4, except when the emulation
  level is VT220 and up. In this case, it generates the same F1 to
  F4 codes as X Consortium xterm. Moreover, it adds a new resource
  <code>sunKeyboard</code>, which tells the program whether it has
  only 12 function keys (i.e., a Sun or PC keyboard). If so (this
  is selectable from the popup menu), you can use the control key
  with F1 to F12 to get F13 to F24, and use the "+" key on the
  keypad as an alias for "," (comma).</p>

  <p>The emulation level for modern xterm is set via the resource
  <code>decTerminalID</code>, e.g., to 220 for a VT220. Once set,
  applications can set the emulation level up or down within that
  limit. DEC's terminals are configured in much the same way by a
  setup option.</p>

  <p>That is the simple way, using a couple of new resources. The
  traditional way to get function keys involves translations. I
  have seen a few postings on the newsgroups that do this. Here is
  one from Bruce Momjian &lt;root@candle.pha.pa.us&gt; for a VT220:

  <p>Note that real VT220 terminals use shifted function keys to
  mean something different: the user-programmable keys (i.e.,
  DECUDK). Modern xterm supports this, but the translations do not
  (they're using shift to select F13 to F20).</p>

  <p>Finally (for the moment) is a further modification of Robert
  Ess's script by <a href=
  "http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~oahlefel/">Erik Ahlefeldt</a>,
  &lt;oahlefel@metz.une.edu.au&gt;. From his readme file, for
  vmsterm:</p>

  <blockquote>
    This script is for people who wish to connect from a Linux or
    Unix computer to a VMS computer using telnet and get a good
    VT100 or VT220 emulation. The key mappings have been
    specifically designed to emulate the VT terminal auxiliary
    numeric keypad, so that you can use VMS EDT and TPU editors, as
    well as the many VMS applications use keys PF1 to PF4. The
    script should work with any recent version of Xterm using a
    standard extended IBM PC keyboard or a Sun keyboard.

    <p>About the keymappings. First the auxiliary numeric keypad.
    My prime objective with these mappings was to produce a setup
    that I could use with the EDT and TPU editors which make
    extensive use of the numeric keypad. The top row of keys PC
    numeric keypad (Num Lock, Divide, Multiply, Subtract) are where
    you find PF1, PF2, PF3, PF4 on a VT keyboard, so I have mapped
    them to PF1 thru PF4. The PC numeric keypad Add key (+) takes
    up the space of two keys which are Minus and Comma on the VT
    keyboard &ndash; I have mapped it to Comma (Delete Character in
    the EDT editor). I have then used the PC Pause key to map to VT
    key Minus (Delete Word in the EDT editor). The remaining keys
    on the auxiliary numeric keypad are the same for PC and VT.</p>

    <p>The six keys between the main and numeric keypads on the PC
    (Insert, Home, Page Up, Delete End, Page Down) are usually
    mapped to the VT keys by either position or by (approximate)
    function. As I rarely use these keys I have mapped them by
    function as follows: PC key Insert to VT Insert Here, PC Home
    to VT Find, PC Page Up to VT Prev, PC Delete to VT Remove, PC
    End to VT Select, PC Page Down to VT Next.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Function keys.</dt>

      <dd>
        There are 12 function keys on the PC keyboard and 20 on the
        VT keyboard, so I map PC F1 thru F12 to VT F1 thru F12
        (except for F1 thru F5 as noted below) and PC Shift F1 thru
        Shift F10 to VT F11 thru F20.

        <p>The VT keys F1 thru F5 are local hardware function keys
        so there is nothing to emulate, however some PC to VT
        emulations in the past have mapped PF1 thru PF4 here, so I
        have done that too, even though they are already mapped on
        the auxiliary numeric keypad.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Xterm functionality.</dt>

      <dd>You lose some xterm functions when you remap the
      keyboard, however this script implements a scroll back buffer
      of 1000 lines which you scroll through using Shift and Up
      (a.k.a. Up Arrow or Cursor Up key) or Shift and Down.</dd>

  <p>The control sequences for doing this are documented in

  <p>The usual context for this question is setting the title

  <p>The terminator "\007" is a problem area.
  <strong>XTerm</strong> historically uses this character, though
  it is non-ANSI. The "correct" character should be a "\233" string
  terminator, or "\033\\", which is the 7-bit equivalent. Modern
  xterm recognizes either (the "\007" or string terminator);
  waiting for the first of these.</p>

  <p>You may have resource or environment problems that prevent you
  from setting the title at all. Newer xterms (starting somewhere
  in X11R5) use the $LANG variable. If your locale is incorrectly
  installed, you will be unable to set the xterm's title. As noted
  by Mikhail Teterin &lt;mi@rtfm.ziplink.net&gt;: Make sure that
  the locale (LANG and/or LOCALE environment variable) is known to
  X Window System. Check ${X11ROOT}/lib/X11/locale.* for it. If it
  is not listed in either one of the files, find the nearest match
  and add an alias to it. Restart X if you have made changes.</p>

  <p>On a related note, some people want to know how to read the
  title from an xterm. This works for modern xterm and dtterm, but
  not for other variations:</p>

  <h4 id="no_ptys-id"><a name="no_ptys" id=
  "no_ptys"><strong>XTerm</strong> does not run (no available
  pty's)</a></h4>

  <p>Your copy of xterm may not have enough permissions to use
  existing pty's:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>you may have to make xterm run setuid to root (though newer
    systems have wrappers that make this unnecessary).</li>

    <li>the pty's permissions may be restrictive (that is ok, but
    you have to make xterm agree with it). Usually this is done by
    making the group ownership of the pty's "tty", and requiring
    that xterm run setgid to "tty". This is done rather than make
    xterm run setuid to root, since that presents problems with
    security.</li>

    <li>newer systems (with Unix98 pty's) have a single entry under
    /dev which has to have the right permissions. For example:

      <blockquote>
        <pre>
        # ls -l /dev/ptmx
        crw-rw----    1 root     tty        5,   2 Aug 21 20:19 /dev/ptmx
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Perhaps your system does not have enough pty's, or (problems
  reported with newer Linux kernels supporting Unix98 pty's,
  beginning with RedHat 6.0) the major device numbers of the pty's
  may have changed during a kernel upgrade. (This is described in
  <code>/usr/src/linux/Documentation</code>).</p>

  <p>See also the MAKEDEV script, which usually exists under
  /dev.</p>

  <h4 id="no_termcap-id"><a name="no_termcap" id="no_termcap">I
  need /etc/termcap</a></h4>

  <p>If you have a termcap version of xterm on a system with no
  termcap libraries, you may also be missing /etc/termcap.</p>

  <p>A workaround is to copy /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/xterm.termcap
  to /etc/termcap.</p>

  <p>This is fixed another way starting with XFree86 3.3.1. If
  xterm cannot find the terminal description, it will accept that,
  though it will print a warning. If xterm does not find the
  termcap entry, it will not set the $TERMCAP variable.</p>

  <h4 id="no_libpath-id"><a name="no_libpath" id="no_libpath">Why
  does $LD_LIBRARY_PATH get reset?</a></h4>

  <p>If xterm is running setuid (which is needed on some systems
  which have no wrappers for opening pty's and updating utmp),
  newer systems automatically set or reset environment variables
  which are considered security problems. These include
  <code>$PATH</code> and <code>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, since they
  affect the choice of which programs are run if not specified via
  a full pathname.</p>

  <p>This means, for example, that if you attempt to run</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
        xterm -e foo
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>where <code>foo</code> is a program that uses shared libraries
  in <code>/usr/local/lib</code>, then the command will fail,
  because <code>/usr/local/lib</code> is not considered part of
  <code>root</code>'s environment.</p>

  <p>Modern Unix systems (such as recent Solaris and HPUX versions)
  do not require you to run xterm setuid. Some will result in odd
  malfunctions if you do this.</p>

  <h4 id="no_ls_and_e-id"><a name="no_ls_and_e" id=
  "no_ls_and_e">Why do the -e and -ls options not work
  together?</a></h4>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> has two useful options for controlling
  the shell that is run:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>-e</dt>

    <dd>tells xterm to execute a command using the remaining
    parameters after this option.</dd>

    <dt>-ls</dt>

    <dd>tells xterm to invoke a login shell, making it read your
    <code>.login</code> file, for instance.</dd>
  </dl>The two are not compatible. If you specify both, xterm uses
  <code>-e</code>, and if that fails for whatever reason will fall
  through to the <code>-ls</code> option. It cannot (in general)
  combine the two, since some shells permit this (e.g., bash), and
  others do not (e.g., tcsh).

  <h4 id="setup_resize-id"><a name="setup_resize" id=
  "setup_resize">Why is my screen size not set?</a></h4>

  <p>Well, it may be set, but not correctly. You may notice these
  symptoms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When editing with vi, you cannot see the beginning of the
    file, or</li>

    <li>Running

      <blockquote>
        <pre>
        stty -a
</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>shows the rows and/or columns values as 0, or some other
      value (such as 65) which has nothing to do with the actual
      window size.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> knows how big the screen is (of
  course), and tries to tell your applications (e.g., by invoking
  ioctl's and sending SIGWINCH). But sometimes it cannot:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>XTerm</strong> itself may have been built
    incorrectly (the #ifdef's that make the logic work are
    inactive).</li>

    <li>You may be running xterm via a remote connection which
    refuses to pass that information. This can happen even on
    "modern" networks where the connection crosses domain
    boundaries.</li>

    <li>You may be running su'd to another account. SIGWINCH is
    just another signal; signals do not propagate for security
    reasons.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Most full-screen applications such as vi are designed to use
  the ioctl calls that return the screen size. When they fail, the
  applications use the size defined in the terminal's terminfo or
  termcap description.</p>

  <p>You may be able to use the <em>resize</em> program to issue
  the ioctl's that will notify your application of the actual
  screen size. This does not always work for the reasons just
  mentioned. Newer versions of stty let you specify the screen
  size, though it will not be updated if you resize the xterm
  window:</p>
  <pre>
<code>        stty rows 24 columns 80
</code>
</pre>

  <p>Most full-screen applications also check if the $LINES and
  $COLUMNS variables are set, using those values to override the
  terminal description:</p>
  <pre>
<code>        setenv LINES 24
        setenv COLUMNS 80
</code>
</pre>

  <p>Why 65 lines? The standard xterm terminfo description
  specifies 65 lines, perhaps because someone liked it that way.
  Real VT100's are 24 lines. I once used (and wrote applications
  for) a Bitgraph terminal, which emulated VT100, but displayed 65
  lines.</p>

  <h4 id="tiny_menus-id"><a name="tiny_menus" id="tiny_menus">Why
  are the menus tiny?</a></h4>

  <p>Everything seems to work, except that the xterm menus (VT
  options, fonts, etc.) do not display properly; the menus pop up,
  but only with a tiny display area in which none of the options
  are visible (and only part of the menu title is visible).</p>

  <p>You have specified the geometry for xterm too high in the
  hierarchy, and that 24x80 (or whatever the -geometry parameter
  happens to be) is applying to the menus in pixels. This resource
  makes the geometry apply to the menus as well as the VT100
  widget: <!--{{atr2html--></p>

  <p>while this applies only to the VT100 widget (which is probably
  what you intended): <!--{{atr2html--></p>

  <h4 id="no_altchar-id"><a name="no_altchar" id="no_altchar">My
  terminal doesn't show box characters</a></h4>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> displays the 7-bit ASCII and VT100
  graphic characters (including box corners) using specially
  arranged fixed-pitch fonts. The first 32 glyph positions (which
  would correspond to nonprinting control characters) are used to
  hold the VT100 graphic characters. Some fonts that otherwise look
  fine (such as courier) do not have glyphs defined for these
  positions. So they display as blanks. Use <em>xfd</em> to display
  the font.</p>

  <p>Modern xterm can form its own line-drawing characters (see
  <a href="xterm.log.html#xterm_90">patch 90</a>, for example). It
  does not draw all of the graphic characters, only those that may
  be done with straight lines. But those are the most used, making
  most of the fixed-pitch fonts useful for xterm.</p>

  <p>You may also have a problem with the terminfo description. As
  distributed, the X11R6 terminfo for xterm does not have the
  <em>acsc</em> string defined, so most implementations of curses
  do not try to use the alternate character set.</p>

  <p>Finally, some people confuse the VT100 graphic characters with
  the VT220 support for DEC technical character set. These are
  distinct (7-bit) character sets. Xterm currently does not support
  this.</p>

  <h4 id="scaled_font-id"><a name="scaled_font" id=
  "scaled_font">The bold font is ugly</a></h4>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> lets you directly specify one bold
  font, which is assumed to correspond to the default font. Older
  versions of xterm make a fake bold font for the other choices via
  the fonts menu by drawing the characters offset by one pixel. I
  modified xterm to ask the font server for a bold font that
  corresponds to each font (other than the default one). Usually
  that works well. However, sometimes the font server gives a poor
  match. Xterm checks for differences in the alignment and size,
  but the font server may give incorrect information about the font
  size. The scaled bitmap font feature gives poor results for the
  smaller fonts. In your X server configuration file, that can be
  fixed by disabling the feature, e.g., by appending ":unscaled" to
  the path: <!--{{atr2html--></p>

  <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 10pt;">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FontPath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<font color="#800080">/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled</font>"<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FontPath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<font color="#800080">/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled</font>"<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FontPath&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<font color="#800080">/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled</font>"<br>

  <!--atr2html}}--></p>

  <p>You can suppress xterm's overstriking for bold fonts using the
  <code>alwaysBoldMode</code> and related resources. However,
  rendering ugly bold fonts is a "feature" of the font server. In
  particular, the TrueType interface provides less ability to the
  client for determining if a particular font supports a bold
  form.</p>

  <h4 id="little_dot-id"><a name="little_dot" id="little_dot">I see
  little dots on the screen</a></h4>

  <p>Well, I do. Perhaps you do not. It depends on the fonts you
  choose, and how you use them.</p>

  <p>Standard xterm has a "normal" font for which a bold font can
  be chosen, and several alternative fonts, useful for changing the
  font size. The alternative fonts do not have corresponding bold
  fonts. Xterm simulates bold fonts in this case by overstriking
  the character one pixel offset. That can make an bold character
  extend into the area that another character occupies. When
  erasing a bold character from the screen, xterm does not erase
  the extra pixel. This is corrected in modern xterm, subject to
  the available fonts (from late 1998, <a href=
  "xterm.log.html#xterm_85">patch 85</a>). For each font, it asks
  the font server for a corresponding bold font. Your font server
  may not have the bold font (or it may incorrectly report that it
  does). But it usually works.</p>

  <h4 id="no_russian-id"><a name="no_russian" id="no_russian">My
  terminal doesn't display Cyrillic characters</a></h4>

  <p>Cyrillic encodings typically use characters in the range
  128-159. For a VT220 (or any terminal that follows ISO 6429),
  those are treated as control characters. Still, some people want
  to use KOI8-R, etc. I modified xterm in <a href=
  "xterm.log.html#xterm_175">patch 175</a> to add an option
  (<code>-k8</code>) and corresponding resource settings to allow
  them to customize their environment. Here is a <a href=
  "ftp://invisible-island.net/xterm/koi8-term">sample script</a>
  and <a href="ftp://invisible-island.net/xterm/KOI8Term">resource
  file</a> which I use for testing this configuration.</p>

  <h4 id="utf8_fonts-id"><a name="utf8_fonts" id="utf8_fonts">I see
  boxes instead of characters in uxterm</a></h4>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> may show boxes instead of characters if
  the font that you have selected does not contain those
  characters. Normally you can fix most of that using the UTF-8
  feature, with <code>uxterm</code>. However, your X resource
  settings may be the source of the problem.</p>

  <p>One pitfall to setting X resources is that they allow you to
  specify wildcards, e.g., the "*" character. When you give a
  wildcard, the X resource matches any number of levels in the
  widget hierarchy.</p>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> has more than one widget matching
  "font" at different levels of the hierarchy. There are the popup
  menus, and there are the fonts used for <code>uxterm</code>. The
  latter is where an overbroad pattern can cause xterm to use a
  different font than you expect.</p>

  <p>Suppose your resource setting includes this pattern 
  <!--{{atr2html--></p>

  <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 10pt;">
  *<strong><font color="#000080">VT100</font></strong>*<font color=
  "#008080">font</font>:<font color=
  "#800080">&nbsp;fixed</font><br>
  <!--atr2html}}--></p>

  <p>It could be interpreted as this: <!--{{atr2html--></p>

  <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 10pt;">
  *<strong><font color="#000080">VT100</font></strong>.<font color=
  "#008080">font</font>:<font color=
  "#800080">&nbsp;fixed</font><br>
  *<strong><font color="#000080">VT100</font></strong>.<font color=
  "#008080">utf8Fonts</font>.<font color=
  "#008080">font</font>:<font color=
  "#800080">&nbsp;fixed</font><br>
  <!--atr2html}}--></p>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> uses the <code>utf8Fonts</code>
  subresources to provide runtime-switchable fonts between
  IS0-8859-1 (Latin-1) and ISO-10646 (Unicode). Modifying the
  Unicode font to "fixed" will make most of the characters
  unavailable (i.e., shown as boxes). If instead your resource
  looks like <!--{{atr2html--></p>

  <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 10pt;">
  *<strong><font color="#000080">VT100</font></strong>.<font color=
  "#008080">font</font>:<font color=
  "#800080">&nbsp;fixed</font><br>
  <!--atr2html}}--></p>

  <p>it would be unambiguous, and not modify the
  <code>utf8Fonts</code> value.</p>

  <h4 id="slow_menus-id"><a name="slow_menus" id="slow_menus">The
  first popup menu is very slow</a></h4>

  <p>Some users report that when starting xterm, it is very slow,
  that their computer's CPU time increases, etc.</p>

  <p>This is a longstanding bug in the X libraries. There is a
  workaround using a resource setting for xterm.</p>

  <h5 id="slow_menus_details-id">Details</h5>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> uses the Athena (Xaw) widgets to
  display popup menus. In the normal case, those are initialized
  one-by-one as they are first used. If you have configured xterm
  to use its toolbar configuration, they are all initialized on
  startup. In the latter, performance problems are more
  noticeable.</p>

  <p>The Athena widgets <code>XawInitializeWidgetSet</code>
  function goes through several levels down to the X library
  <code>_XlcAddUtf8LocaleConverters</code> function to call
  <code>create_tocs_conv</code> and related functions to make a
  list of character sets from the locale, which is used in menus to
  get all possible fonts needed for a fontset.</p>

  <p>If your current locale uses <em>UTF-8</em> encoding, this will
  read a long list of bitmap fonts&mdash;everything whose
  <em>encoding</em> might be useful for displaying the menus. For
  example, this list (from <code>lcUTF8.c</code>) which dates from
  around 2000 is the core of the problem:</p>

  <blockquote>
    ISO10646-1, ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2, ISO8859-3, ISO8859-4,
    ISO8859-5, ISO8859-6, ISO8859-7, ISO8859-8, ISO8859-9,
    ISO8859-10, ISO8859-11, ISO8859-13, ISO8859-14, ISO8859-15,

    ISO10646-1, ISO10646-1
  </blockquote>

  <p>However, xterm is going to use only the characters shown in
  the popup menus. It is unlikely that you need Chinese fonts for
  that.</p>

  <h5 id="slow_menus_solution-id">Solution</h5>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong>'s <code>menuLocale</code> resource can
  be set to an explicit value, e.g., "C" to override the current
  locale as seen by this initialization debacle.</p>

  <p>The workaround does not prevent some hacker from "improving"

  <h4 id="xterm_8bits-id"><a name="xterm_8bits" id=

  <p>You must have the <code>eightBitInput</code> resource set to

  <h4 id="xterm_erase-id"><a name="xterm_erase" id=
  "xterm_erase">Why doesn't my delete key work?</a></h4>

  <p>This seems to be a problem with the older XFree86 release
  (3.1.2). I have picked up pieces of the story (xterm and the
  keyboard work as designed under XFree86 3.2 and up).</p>

  <p>The underlying problem is that we've accumulated three things
  that are being equated as "Delete":</p>
  <pre>
        ASCII backspace (code 8)
        ASCII delete (code 127)
        VT220 "remove" aka "delete" (ESC [ 3 ~)
</pre>

  <p>You are probably talking about the <strong>backarrow</strong>
  key (on my keyboard, at the upper right of the QWERTY block), or
  the key labeled <strong>delete</strong> which is on the 6-key
  "editing keypad". Since xterm is emulating a VT100/VT220, the
  backarrow key should generate a 127 (often displayed as
  <code>^?</code>). You would use a control/H to obtain a backspace
  on a real VT220.</p>

  <p>Tastes differ on Unix, people expect the backarrow key to
  generate a backspace (or not). As I understand it, at one point,
  XFree86 picked up the sense of the erase character during
  initialization, so that xterm would in effect use the same erase
  character as the console. The current scheme (X11R6) uses
  keyboard mapping tables that are independent of the
  environment.</p>

  <p>Modern xterm provides a resource toggle <em>backarrowKey</em>
  (and an escape sequence from VT320) that changes this key between
  the two styles (backspace or delete).</p>

  <p>With modern xterm <a href="xterm.log.html#xterm_95">patch
  95</a> (also in the stable version as "88c"), you may have an
  xterm which can automatically initialize the backarrow key to
  backspace or delete depending on the pseudo terminal's sense, or
  based on the termcap setting of <em>kbs</em> (backspace key).
  This feature is controlled by the resource setting
  <em>ptyInitialErase</em>.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_erased-id"><a name="xterm_erased" id=
  "xterm_erased">Why did my delete key stop working?</a></h4>

  <p>Well, something changed. You have to determine what did.</p>

  <p>This may be because an upgrade introduced different X resource
  settings, or because you are using the newer xterm with the
  <em>ptyInitialErase</em> resource (or perhaps both). Use</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
        appres XTerm
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>to see the X resources that you are using, in particular the
  <code>translation</code> (or <code>Translation</code>) resource
  for the vt100 widget.</p>

  <p>One unexpected scenario came out of hiding when I was
  implementing the <em>ptyInitialErase</em> resource. When xterm is
  (by default) built to support this, it sets the pty's erase
  character to match the termcap entry. Xterm also sets the
  $TERMCAP environment variable to match. So everything is
  consistent, and everything defined. The <code>stty erase</code>
  character is either backspace (^H) or delete (^?).</p>

  <p>The problem arises because there are two things called
  "delete", which were not well-defined: ASCII delete (127) and the
  PC-style adaptation of VT220 <kbd>remove</kbd> assigned to the
  key Delete.</p>

  <p>However, the <em>screen</em> program prefers to make the
  termcap delete (<code>kD</code>) an &lt;escape&gt;[3~, which
  corresponds to the VT220 <kbd>remove</kbd> key. If $TERMCAP is
  set when starting <em>screen</em>, it will translate stty's erase
  character into the &lt;escape&gt;[3~, making most curses and
  termcap applications work. But stty still has the original erase
  character. So low-level applications which check stty will not
  work. I found that unsetting $TERMCAP before running would work,
  but this was not a good solution. Someone pointed out (see
  <a href="xterm.log.html#xterm_129">patch 129</a>), that the
  problem really was because termcap <code>kD</code> should delete
  the character at the current position. So it cannot be the same
  as <code>stty erase</code>.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, <code>stty erase</code> has to be a
  single character, so &lt;escape&gt;[3~ would not work anyway.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_xmodmap-id"><a name="xterm_xmodmap" id=
  "xterm_xmodmap">Well, how can I set my delete key?</a></h4>

  <p>When people first started asking this question in 1995-1996,
  it appeared in the context of making Netscape work. Netscape's
  use of the delete key running in X did not match user's
  expectations when compared to that other platform. They were
  commonly advised to use <em>xmodmap</em>, e.g.,</p>

  <blockquote>

  <p>or</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
        keycode 22 = 0xff08
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Either way is a bad technical solution &ndash; it works for
  some people but not others (on my keyboard at work, keycode 22 is
  the numeric keypad '9').</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you can set resources. This works reasonably
  well for environments where you have different versions of xterm,
  e.g., <!--{{atr2html--></p>

  <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 10pt;">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font color="#000080">XTerm</font></strong>*<strong><font color="#000080">VT100</font></strong>.<font color="#008080">translations</font>:<font color="#800080">&nbsp;#override&nbsp;\n\<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Key&gt;Delete:&nbsp;string(</font><strong><font color="#008080">0x7f</font></strong><font color="#800080">)</font><br>

  <!--atr2html}}--></p>

  <p>I do not do that either, because it is not flexible. Not all
  programs use the same sense of <code>stty erase</code>; some use
  termcap or terminfo, and some are hardcoded. So I prefer to be
  able to switch the xterm's keyboard at runtime. You cannot do
  that with resources. (Or not really &ndash; xterm has a
  <code>keymap()</code> action which could support this if you
  provided a rather complex resource settings, but the X library
  support for that is broken in X11R6). Instead, I have added to
  xterm a set of resources (and popup menu entries) to allow simple
  switching between the different styles of keyboard, in particular
  for the backspace/delete issues. See the manual page for
  <code>backarrowKey</code> <code>backarrowKeyIsErase</code> and
  <code>deleteIsDEL</code> as well as <code>sunKeyboard</code>.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_keypad-id"><a name="xterm_keypad" id=
  "xterm_keypad">Why doesn't my keypad work?</a></h4>

  <p>A few people have commented that the keypad does not work
  properly. Aside from bugs (I have fixed a few), the most common
  problem seems to be misconception.</p>

  <p>Here's a picture of the VT100 numeric keypad:</p>
  <pre>
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | PF1 | PF2 | PF3 | PF4 |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
        |  7  |  8  |  9  |  -  |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
        |  4  |  5  |  6  |  ,  |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
        |  1  |  2  |  3  |     |
        +-----+-----+-----+ ENT +
        |     0     |  .  |     |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
</pre>

  <p>and the similar Sun and PC keypads:</p>
  <pre>
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | NUM |  /  |  *  |  -  |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
        |  7  |  8  |  9  |     |
        +-----+-----+-----+  +  +
        |  4  |  5  |  6  |     |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
        |  1  |  2  |  3  |     |
        +-----+-----+-----+ ENT +
        |     0     |  .  |     |
        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
</pre>

  <p>Working in X11, the NUM (NumLock) key has better uses than an
  alias for PF1 (and is sometimes reserved). I use the F1 through
  F4 on the keyboard to implement PF1 through PF4, alias the keypad
  "+" to "," and use the existing "-" key.</p>

  <p>VT220 emulation uses the VT100 numeric keypad as well as a
  6-key editing keypad. Here's a picture of the VT220 editing
  keypad:</p>
  <pre>
        +--------+--------+--------+
        | Find   | Insert | Remove |
        +--------+--------+--------+
        | Select | Prev   | Next   |
        +--------+--------+--------+
</pre>

  <p>and the similar Sun and PC keypads:</p>
  <pre>
        +--------+--------+--------+
        | Insert | Home   | PageUp |
        +--------+--------+--------+
        | Delete | End    | PageDn |
        +--------+--------+--------+
</pre>

  <p>I chose to use keys that are mnemonic rather than in the
  "same" positions, though some emulators (e.g., Tera Term) use the
  same positions:</p>
  <pre>
        +--------+--------+--------+
        | Insert | Find   | Prev   |
        +--------+--------+--------+
        | Remove | Select | Next   |
        +--------+--------+--------+
</pre>

  <p>I test the keyboard (for VT52/VT100/VT220) using <a href=
  "../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>. If you find (or think that
  you have found) a problem with the keyboard handling of xterm,
  please test it with vttest first.</p>

  <p>Other arrangements of the keyboard are possible of course. If
  you prefer to use the top row of the numeric keypad as PF1
  through PF4, you should do this using xterm's X resources.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_pageup-id"><a name="xterm_pageup" id=
  "xterm_pageup">Why can't I use the pageup/pagedown keys?</a></h4>

  <p>Some vendors, e.g,. Sun, have added key translations which
  make the pageup and pagedown keys talk to the xterm's scrollbar
  instead of your application. They did the same thing for the home
  and end keys, thereby obscuring a bug in <a href=
  "#bug_xterm_r6">xterm</a>.</p>

  <p>You can override this by specifying your own translations in
  your resource file. Use the translations in</p>

  editor, while leaving their shifted equivalents available for the
  scrollbar.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_pc_style-id"><a name="xterm_pc_style" id=
  "xterm_pc_style">Why can't I use the home/end keys?</a></h4>

  <p>This is a long story, unless you are referring to X Consortium
  <a href="#bug_xterm_r6">xterm</a>. That program is simply broken
  in this respect.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, when the home/end keys were fixed for modern
  xterm (in early 1996), there was some discussion regarding what
  the escape sequences should be for those keys (for the 6-key
  editing keypad). Those were chosen as "PC-style" codes (like SCO
  "ansi"), i.e.,</p>
  <pre>
        ESC [ H
        ESC [ F
</pre>

  <p>for normal mode, and</p>
  <pre>
        ESC O H
        ESC O F
</pre>

  <p>for cursor application mode.</p>

  <p>That style of coding fit easily into the existing logic of
  xterm. It was not my change, and (because xterm should be based
  upon standards), I did question this, and asked the opinion of
  the person who was at that time developing rxvt. He had chosen a
  layout based on DEC's VT220 terminals, though the key labels on
  the typical PC keyboard did not <a href=
  "#xterm_keypad">match</a>. At that point, neither of us knew
  enough to make a good case for this.</p>

  <p>Somewhat later I could see that xterm had a number of
  undocumented extensions to support the VT220-style (pre-ISO 2022)
  character sets. I decided to complete the functionality by making
  xterm a VT220 emulator. This would require that it provide the
  same escape sequences for the editing and numeric keypads. I
  could not simply change the escape sequences from "PC-style" to
  "VT220-style", since a number of users "knew" that the keypad
  "ought to" send home, end, cursor keys, etc., because they had
  labels indicating that use. To retain compatibility (but allow
  easy reconfiguration to make a VT220 emulator), I added
  popup-menu items to switch between the modes. With minor
  refinements, this was the approach for about two years,
  culminating with the <a href="xterm.log.html#xterm_88">"stable"
  patch #88</a>, which is essentially the version distributed with
  XFree86 3.3.x.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>NOTE</em>:</dt>

    <dd>
      the terminfo distributed with xterm patch #88 is incorrect:
      the escape sequences given for home/end keys are the
      VT220-style, rather than the default PC-style. Too accustomed
      to switching modes on the fly, I overlooked a line in my
      .Xdefaults file: <!--{{atr2html-->

      <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 10pt;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<font color=
      "#008080">sunKeyboard</font>:<font color=
      "#800080">&nbsp;</font><strong><font color=
      "#000080">true</font></strong><br>
      <!--atr2html}}--></p>

      <p>Downstream packagers (when they noticed this) accommodated
      the bug by modifying the VT100 translations resource which is
      not a good technical solution since it interferes with the
      users' ability to modify that resource. See <a href=
      "#xterm_xmodmap">this</a> for more discussion.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>But xterm continues to evolve past the stable patch #88. The
  keyboard support was still unsatisfactory for two reasons:

  <ul>
    <li>some users wanted to be able to use applications that
    detected whether the control key was pressed (e.g.,
    control/F1).</li>

    <li>the compromises made for <code>xkb</code> with X11R6
    interfered with xterm's use of the NumLock key for the numeric
    keypad.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The former could be addressed by expanding the escape
  sequences sent by the PC-style function keys, while the latter
  was a VT100/VT220 design issue. I decided to redesign
  function-key support to separate the two styles of function keys
  better, but leaving the choice still controlled by the
  <code>sunKeyboard</code> resource. Partway through that, I was
  asked to do similar cleanup and redesign of the backspace and
  delete key handling, e.g., the <a href=
  "#xterm_erased">ptyInitialErase</a> resource. Because it is a
  redesign, I chose to not make the keyboard differences between
  the old and new xterms completely compatible. If you were to run
  both on the same system, one or the other would have some
  problems with the editing keypad or the backspace/delete keys
  which would be addressed by the popup-menu selections.</p>

  <p>For example, at this time (2001/9/4):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Debian stable is xterm-88c, which should be identical to
    the XFree86 3.3.6 version, but is not (there are some label
    differences in the resource-file, but nothing interesting
    relative to home/end keys). And of course, Debian changes the
    terminfo <code>kbs</code> from <code>^H</code> to
    <code>^?</code>. As noted, the terminfo I wrote for XFree86
    3.3.x has an error. Setting <!--{{atr2html-->

      <!--atr2html}}--></p>

      <p>in the app-defaults file fixes the problem with xterm-88,
      which was that I documented in the terminfo the behavior
      <em>with</em> that resource set. Similarly, setting 
      <!--{{atr2html--></p>

      <p>is one way to address Debian's change to
      <code>kbs</code>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Debian unstable is xterm-149. Other than omitting the color
    resources from the app-defaults file, I see that it sets

  <h4 id="xterm_arrows-id"><a name="xterm_arrows" id=
  "xterm_arrows">Why can't I use the cursor keys in (whatever)
  shell?</a></h4>

  <p>VTxxx (VT100 and up) terminals may send different escape
  sequences for the cursor (arrow) keys depending on how they are
  set up. The choices are referred to as the normal and application
  modes. Initially, the terminal is in normal mode.</p>

  <p>VTxxx terminals are usually set up so that full-screen
  applications will use the cursor application mode strings. This
  is good for full-screen applications, including legacy
  applications which may have hard-coded behavior, but bad for
  interactive shells (e.g., ksh, tcsh, bash) which use arrow keys
  to scroll through a history of command strings.</p>

  <p>To see the difference between normal/application modes,
  consider this example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In normal (non-application) mode, the terminal transmits a
    down-arrow as \E[C, which happens to echo as a down-arrow.</li>

    <li>In application mode the terminal transmits \EOC, which
    echoes as C. That is because the \EO is the SS3 control, which
    says to use the character from the G3 character set for the
    next cell.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Since termcaps and terminfo descriptions are written for
  full-screen applications, shells and similar programs often rely
  on built-in tables of escape sequences which they use instead.
  Defining keys in terms of the termcap/terminfo entry (e.g., by
  capturing the string sent by tputs) is apt to confuse the
  shell.</p>

  <p>Depending on the terminal type, the keypad(s) on the keyboard
  may switch modes along with the cursor keys, or have their own
  independent modes. The control sequences for these are
  independent of the ones used for cursor-addressing, but are
  grouped together, e.g., as the terminfo <code>smkx</code> and
  <code>rmkx</code> capabilities. Terminfo entries are written
  assuming that the application has initialized the terminal using
  the <code>smkx</code> string before it is able to match the codes
  given for the cursor or keypad keys.</p>

  <h4 id="bash_meta_mode-id"><a name="bash_meta_mode" id=
  "bash_meta_mode">Alt-keys do not work in bash</a></h4>See
  <a href="../ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#bash_meta_mode">Alt-keys do
  not work in bash</a>.

  <h3 id="problems_colors-id"><a href="problems_colors">Colors and
  other graphic rendition</a></h3>

  <h4 id="no_color-id"><a name="no_color" id="no_color">My terminal
  doesn't recognize color</a></h4>

  <p>First, ensure that you have set up xterm to render color.
  Modern xterm renders color only if you have set resources to do
  this; the default behavior is monochrome to maintain
  compatibility with older applications. The manual page describes
  these resources. I set them in my <a href=
  "#my_xdefaults">.Xdefaults</a> file.</p>

  <p>Even if you set the resources properly, there may be another
  application running which prevents xterm from allocating the
  colors you have specified. But you should see a <a href=
  "#alloc_color">warning message</a> for this.</p>

  <p>Check the terminal description, to see if it is installed
  properly, e.g., for <a href=
  "../ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#no_color">ncurses</a>, which uses
  terminfo.</p>

  <p>Finally, some applications (that do not interface properly
  with terminfo or termcap) may need the environment variable
  <a href="../ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#no_colorterm">$COLORTERM</a>
  to be set.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_terminfo-id"><a name="xterm_terminfo" id=
  "xterm_terminfo">What $TERM should I use?</a></h4>

  <p>The <code>xterm-color</code> value for $TERM is a bad choice
  for modern xterm because it is commonly used for a terminfo entry
  which happens to not support <code>bce</code>. Complicating
  matters, FreeBSD (after dithering for a few years on the matter)
  introduced a bastardized version which implies the opposite sense
  of <code>bce</code>, (because it uses SGR 39 and 49), but does
  not set it. After lengthy discussion, FreeBSD began using the
  terminal descriptions which I've written.</p>

  <p>The most recent XFree86 version's terminal description
  corresponds to <code>xterm-xfree86</code> (also distributed with
  ncurses). I have continued to make changes; the most recent
  version is simply named <code>xterm-new</code> (also distributed
  with ncurses).</p>

  <p>The term "<code>bce</code>" stands for "back color erase".
  Terminals such as modern xterm and rxvt implement back color
  erase, others such as dtterm do not. (Roughly half of the
  emulators that I know about implement bce). When an application
  clears the screen, a terminal that implements back color erase
  will retain the last-set background color. A terminal that does
  not implement back color erase will reset the background color to
  the default or initial colors. Applications that paint most of
  the screen in a single color are more efficient on terminals that
  support back color erase.</p>

  <p>Curses libraries that support color know about
  <code>bce</code> and do the right thing &ndash; provided that you
  tell them what the terminal does. That is the whole point of
  setting $TERM. The "xterm-color" description distributed with
  ncurses does not list <code>bce</code>, because it was applied
  originally to a terminal type which does not implement back color
  erase. It will "work" for modern xterm, though less efficient.
  Some other applications such as the slang library have hardcoded
  support for terminals that implement back color erase. Given the
  "xterm-color" description, those will be efficient &ndash; and
  fortuitously work. However, slang (through version 1.4.0) did not
  work properly for the terminals that xterm-color was designed
  for. See this <a href="../lynx/lynx-ncurses.html">page</a> for an
  example of (n)curses and slang running on dtterm. That bug in
  slang is reported to be fixed for succeeding versions, though
  your application may require changes to use this fix. (The demo
  which comes with slang to illustrate the use of <code>bce</code>
  does not work properly, for instance).</p>

  <p>The <code>xterm-color</code> value for $TERM is also (for the
  same reason) a bad choice for rxvt, but "works" due to the large
  number of hard-coded applications that override this.</p>

  <p>Some people recommend using <code>xtermc</code>. That is
  installed on Solaris. However, it does not match any xterm in
  current use. (Apparently it was written for an obsolete version
  on Unixware). The colors work, true, but the mouse will not, nor
  will the function keys.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_hilite-id"><a name="xterm_hilite" id=
  "xterm_hilite">Reverse video is not reset</a></h4>

  <p>When running <em>less</em> or other programs that do
  highlighting, you see the highlighting not turned off
  properly.</p>

  <p>This may be due to incompatible terminal descriptions for
  xterm. With XFree86 3.2, I modified the terminal description for
  XFree86 xterm to use the VT220 (aka ISO 6429) controls that allow
  an application to turn off highlighting (or bold, underline)
  without modifying the other attributes. The X Consortium xterm
  does not recognize these controls.</p>

  <p>If, for example, you are running an older xterm and rlogin to
  a system where the newer xterm has been installed, you will have
  this problem, because both programs default to $TERM set to
  xterm. The solution for mixed systems is to install the newer
  terminal description as as a different name (e.g.,
  <code>xterm-color</code>) and set the <code>termName</code>
  resource accordingly in the app-defaults file for the system
  which has the newer xterm.</p>

  <p>However &ndash; see <a href="#xterm_terminfo">above</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="vim_16colors-id"><a name="vim_16colors" id=
  "vim_16colors">My colors changed in vim</a></h4>

  <p>Some <code>vim</code> users may notice their colors change
  after updating to <a href="xterm.log.html#xterm_238">patch
  238</a>. Before, some text would display in a dark color using a
  bold font. Now, it displays in a bright color and normal
  font.</p>

  <p>This is not a bug, but the result of a feature
  <em>tcap-query</em> which was added for vim in 2000. Several vim
  users requested that it be enabled by default in the configure
  script. It allows vim to ask what characters the different
  function keys actually send, eliminating the chance that the
  termcap does not match.</p>

  <p>Vim also asks how many colors the terminal supports. Since
  <a href="xterm.log.html#xterm_148">patch 148</a>, xterm has
  responded with the number of distinct colors that it can display.
  By default, that is 16 (8 ANSI colors with bright counterparts
  for displaying PC-style "bold" text).</p>

  <p>The interpretation of this depends on the application:
  termcaps do not tell how to display more than 8 colors. But vim
  understands how to tell xterm to display using 16 colors. It
  makes a difference when displaying bright colors. Vim has a table
  of 16 color names ("dos-colors"), which one can use to define
  parts of the color scheme. If the terminal supports only 8 colors
  (colors 0-7), vim uses the bold attribute to simulate colors
  8-15.</p>

  <p>Changing the color scheme to use bold where it is wanted will
  make the colors work as before &ndash; and work consistently with
  other terminals.</p>

  <h4 id="bold_vs_16colors-id"><a name="bold_vs_16colors" id=
  "bold_vs_16colors">Aren't bright colors the same as
  bold?</a></h4>

  <p>No.</p>

  <p>Actually, "bold" happens to be whatever the terminal shows
  when it is sent the control-string that says "show bold".</p>

  <p>The standard (ANSI aka ISO-6429 or ECMA-48) says no more than
  that. ANSI specified eight (8) colors. In fact, ANSI did not
  specify the appearance. That is an implementation detail.</p>

  <p>XTerm can be configured to use colors 8-15 for displaying bold
  text. Or it can be configured to use those colors as part of a
  16-color scheme (a feature of aixterm). They use different
  control strings. When xterm is configured to use the 16-color
  scheme, it displays bold text by relying on the font to show
  "bold" (usually thicker characters).</p>

  <p>By default, colors 8-15 are brighter versions of colors 0-7
  (with some special handling for blue). But again, xterm is
  configurable and you can use anything that you like for the
  numbered colors.</p>

  <h4 id="dont_like_blue-id"><a name="dont_like_blue" id=
  "dont_like_blue">I don't like that shade of blue</a></h4>

  <p>Nobody does. But there are no universal solutions.</p>

  <p>If your terminal (or the application running in it has a dark
  background, then darker blues are hard to see. With a light
  background, yellows are hard to see.</p>

  <p>The available standards do not help: there <em>are</em> no
  standards for terminal colors. Here is an illustration which I
  made in reply to a <a href=
  "http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=241717">bug
  report</a>, contrasting different choices for blue, against some
  of the other terminals which (were said to) provide "standard
  vt100 colors":</p>

  <blockquote>
    <a href="images/contrast.jpg"><img width="450" src=
    "images/contrast.jpg" alt=
    "Contrasting blue in terminal emulators"></a>
  </blockquote>Of course, anyone <em>developing</em> a terminal
  emulator already knew that <a href=
  "../ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#vt100_color">vt100's never did do
  colors</a>.

  <p>Ultimately it is up to the application running in a terminal
  to enforce the colors it needs. XTerm merely provides the best
  compromise on default visibility that I and my users have
  found.</p>

  <h4 id="why_no_italics-id"><a name="why_no_italics" id=
  "why_no_italics">Why doesn't xterm support italics?</a></h4>

  <p>Well, actually it does and it doesn't.</p>

  <p>You can display "any" font using xterm (though proportional
  fonts may be disappointing).</p>

  <p>But xterm has specific types of graphic rendition that it will
  do. If you want italics, then xterm has an option
  (<code>italicULMode</code>) to use that rendition instead of
  underlining. That is the usual typographic alternative, though of
  course some people want both at the same time.</p>

  <p>However, curses does not support italics. Few terminals do
  this reliably, so it was disregarded long ago, never was
  standardized except for low-level applications (in terminfo). No
  bit was reserved in the curses header for adding italics for
  high-level applications. (As a special case, ncurses could be
  modified to do this, but other implementations would not
  work).</p>

  <p>XTerm stores each cell of the display in fixed-size
  structures. One byte stores the graphic rendition. XTerm is using
  all of the bits in this byte for its VT220 emulation:</p>

  <table border="1" summary="Bits for XTerm's graphic rendition">
    <tr>
      <th>Mnemonic</th>

      <th>Bit</th>

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>INVERSE</td>

      <td>0</td>

      <td>show cell reverse-video</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>UNDERLINE</td>

      <td>1</td>

      <td>show cell underlined</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>BOLD</td>

      <td>2</td>

      <td>show cell as bold</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>BLINK</td>

      <td>3</td>

      <td>show cell as blinking</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>BG_COLOR</td>

      <td>4</td>

      <td>use background color</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>FG_COLOR</td>

      <td>5</td>

      <td>use foreground color</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>PROTECTED</td>

      <td>6</td>

      <td>character cannot be erased</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>CHARDRAWN</td>

      <td>7</td>

      <td>character has been drawn here on the screen</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>While additional bytes could be added to each cell, the cost
  to the typical user has so far not been in line with the
  usefulness of the feature.</p>

  <h4 id="grep_colors-id"><a name="grep_colors" id=
  "grep_colors">"grep --color" does not show the right
  output</a></h4>

  <p>GNU grep (version 2.5) introduced a <code>--color</code>
  option.</p>

  <p>It does this for each highlighted match:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>it writes the text up to (not including the match)</li>

    <li>it writes an ANSI color control control sequence</li>

    <li>it writes the matched text</li>

    <li>it writes a control sequence to clear to the end of the
    line</li>

    <li>it writes an ANSI control sequence to reset graphic
    rendition.</li>

    <li>repeat this process until the entire line is written.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>One problem is in the second and fourth steps. If the
  preceding text brought us up to the last column, then xterm (and
  any VT100-compatible terminal) is waiting for graphic text to
  wrap to the next line. Any controls would take effect on the
  current column position. Newlines are ignored while in this
  state.</p>

  <p>However, if xterm gets a control sequence while waiting to
  wrap to the next line, it will update the screen according to
  that control. Then it is ready to accept more data. But at this
  point, it is no longer waiting to wrap; the special case is for
  newline versus graphic characters. For instance, backspacing
  clears the state (<a href="../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>
  illustrates this). So the data starts to write at the current
  column (the last one on the line), rather than at the beginning
  of the next line. In that case, grep's output will not look
  right.</p>

  <h4 id="vt100_wrapping-id"><a name="vt100_wrapping" id=
  "vt100_wrapping">That description of wrapping is odd, say
  more?</a></h4>

  <p>This is one of the aspects of the so-called "vt100 glitch", as
  mentioned in the terminfo manpage:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Terminals which ignore a line-feed immediately after an am
    wrap, such as the Concept and vt100, should indicate xenl.
  </blockquote>

  <p>When the terminal reaches the right margin, it is in a special
  state where it ignores tab characters and other formatting
  controls (carriage return and newline), and in effect is
  expecting only printable characters to wrap to the next line.</p>

  <p>Without it, it is misleading to refer to a terminal as a vt100
  emulator. After all, it is a well-known feature named for the
  VT100. The applicable standards (ISO-6429, ECMA-48) do not go
  into enough detail to address this sort of behavior, so the other
  terminal emulators can be referred to most accurately as ANSI
  terminals (if they obey the other guidelines).</p>

  <p><a href="../vttest/CHANGES">In 2004</a>, I added a test-screen
  to vttest to demonstrate this. It was in response to someone who
  insisted that xterm was wrong and one of those other terminal
  emulators was "right". I investigated, found that the behavior
  had not changed in xterm at least since the early 1990s, and that
  it matched the description of behavior from the DEC manuals. One
  of my users verified the correctness of the test on a VT520.</p>

  <p>Reviewing the results with xterm-alikes or less ambitious
  "vt100 emulators" in mid-2012:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>xterm, kterm, mlterm, rxvt are consistent with the VT100
    behavior.</li>

    <li>screen, putty (pterm), konsole, vte (gnome-terminal),
    xfce4-terminal are not consistent with VT100 (and behave
    differently compared to each other).

      <p>I included screen here because it claims to be a vt100
      emulator, and putty since it claims to be an xterm emulator.
      I did not include tmux, because it does not make either
      claim.</p>
    </li>

    <li>mrxvt does not get to that screen; it resizes its window to
    a single line.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="problems_weird-id"><a name="problems_weird" id=
  "problems_weird">Odd behavior</a></h3>

  <h4 id="xterm_paste-id"><a name="xterm_paste" id=
  "xterm_paste">Why can't I cut/paste in xterm?</a></h4>

  <p>When an application sets xterm to any of its mouse tracking
  modes, it reserves the unshifted mouse button clicks for the
  application's use. Unless you have modified the treatment of the
  shifted mouse button events (e.g., with your window manager), you
  can always do cut/paste by pressing the shift key while clicking
  with the mouse.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_tabs-id"><a name="xterm_tabs" id="xterm_tabs">Why
  can't I select tabs in xterm?</a></h4>

  <p>This issue was noted early on, <a href="#known_bugs">here</a>
  in 1997.</p>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> is copying from the screen, which
  stores only printable characters. That includes spaces and
  line-drawing characters. But tabs are special; they are used for
  more than one purpose.</p>

  <p>If the screen is cleared in some part, that stores nulls.
  Cursor addressing does not fill in nulls as it jumps around,
  though xterm does supply blanks for the most useful cases,
  especially when getting data for a selection.</p>

  <p>Full-screen programs such as text-editors tend to write in
  random fashion, and generally do not print nulls to the screen.
  Curses on the other hand, may supply tabs where you thought there
  were none. Also, the terminal driver can expand tabs (and often
  is set to do this by default).</p>

  <p>So the whole thing is unreliable: unless you make special
  arrangements for each of the programs running inside xterm, you
  would often get a tab when you expect, and vice versa.</p>

  <p>For the special case where your expectations would match the
  available data, it is solvable. There are basically two ways it
  could be done:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>set a bit in each cell's data which says it was skipped
    over via a tab. The complication is that xterm is using all of
    the flag bits in each cell.</li>

    <li>store literal tabs and nulls to be interpreted later
    &ndash; both by the display and the selection logic.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As of 2010, a few other terminals do implement this feature.
  But the reason that it's been low-priority is that it's of very
  limited usefulness when copying between terminal sessions (and
  for that matter, from other clients).</p>

  <p>I have an old (3.1.2G) bug report for xterm which may be
  related to the second (3.9s) problem:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Steven Lang &lt;tiger@ecis.com&gt; reports a problem with
    extra resize events for xterm.

      <p>When I change font size often I will get the
      double-refresh, and when that happens the text program gets 2
      resize events.. Running a quick test, I got this: Going to a
      bigger font, it got a 53x20 resize, then a 80x24 resize.
      Going to a smaller font, it got a 120x27 resize, then a 80x24
      resize.</p>

      <p>Earlier I made a mention of changing font size in rxvt
      (And xterm does it to) causing 2 resize events. Well I just
      happened to do it in fvwm (Instead of fvwm 95) and found it
      seems to be a 'feature' of fvwm95, not XFree86 as I'd
      initially assumed.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Stephen Marley &lt;stephen@memex.com&gt; reports a problem
    with the active icon (from X11R6.3 xterm):

      <p>Using the XFree86 xterm-53 with the active icon feature
      on, I get some problems resizing where the xterm window
      shrinks as small as possible and won't stay at whatever size
      you set it thereafter.</p>

      <p>Comment out the PixmapPath and IconPath from your .fvwmrc
      file to disable the fvwm icons and restart the WM. Start an
      xterm. Iconify xterm and maximize it again. Use resize button
      or corners to resize the xterm.</p>

      <p>The xterm now shrinks to a tiny size and attempts to
      resize it result in it shrinking again.</p>

      <p>I've tried this with fvwm 1.23 and fvwm 2.0.46 with the
      same results. Olvm, olvwm and twm all behave correctly so it
      may be a fvwm problem.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>I have not observed the first, but have reproduced the
  second.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_tite-id"><a name="xterm_tite" id="xterm_tite">Why
  doesn't the screen clear when running vi?</a></h4>

  <p>This refers to the "alternate screen" feature, which has been
  used in its termcap file since 1988. On various systems, this
  feature may have been removed, although it has always been in the
  xterm sources.</p>

  <p>The feature is controllable (it can be enabled or disabled).
  However, as it was originally conceived, that ability to control
  it applies only to programs using termcap.</p>

  <p>Under SunOS 4.x, the termcap description for xterm embeds in
  the <code>ti</code> and <code>te</code> capabilities a command to
  switch to xterm's alternate screen (e.g., while running
  <code>vi</code>), and return to the normal screen on exit. This
  has the effect of clearing the screen. Under Solaris 2.x, the
  terminfo description does not use the alternate screen (it is a
  matter of preference after all), so that the text from vi remains
  on the screen after exit. There are corresponding terminfo
  symbols for <code>ti</code> and <code>te</code>:
  <code>smcup</code> and <code>rmcup</code>, respectively.</p>

  <p>This is configurable...</p>

  <p>For example (from Bjorn Helgaas &lt;helgaas@dhc.net&gt;) this
  procedure adds these capabilities to the "xterm" terminfo
  definition on HP-UX 10.20: <!--{{atr2html--></p>

  <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 10pt;">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp&nbsp;/usr/lib/terminfo/x/xterm&nbsp;/usr/lib/terminfo/x/xterm.orig<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;untic&nbsp;xterm&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;/tmp/xterm.src<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font color="#000080">echo</font></strong>&nbsp;<font color="#800080">"&nbsp;smcup=</font><strong><font color="#800000">\</font></strong><font color="#800080">E7</font><strong><font color="#800000">\</font></strong><font color="#800080">E[?47h,&nbsp;rmcup=</font><strong><font color="#800000">\</font></strong><font color="#800080">E[2J</font><strong><font color="#800000">\</font></strong><font color="#800080">E[?47l</font><strong><font color="#800000">\</font></strong><font color="#800080">E8,"</font>&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;/tmp/xterm.src<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tic&nbsp;/tmp/xterm.src<br>

  <!--atr2html}}--></p>

  <p>In this example, the terminfo strings are a series of
  operations:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>smcup</code></dt>

    <dd><code>\E7</code> saves the cursor's position</dd>

    <dd><code>\E[?47h</code> switches to the alternate screen</dd>

    <dt><code>rmcup</code></dt>

    <dd><code>\E[2J</code> clears the screen (assumed to be the
    alternate screen)</dd>

    <dd><code>\E[?47l</code> switches back to the normal
    screen</dd>

    <dd><code>\E8</code> restores the cursor's position.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>However, xterms that are linked with termcap are more flexible
  in this area than those linked with terminfo libraries. The xterm
  program supports a resource <code>titeInhibit</code> which
  manipulates the $TERMCAP variable to accomplish this. It sets the
  $TERMCAP variable for the client with the <code>ti</code> and
  <code>te</code> capabilities suppressed. Systems that use
  terminfo cannot do this. If you are running terminfo with the
  alternate screen controls in the terminal description, then you
  can suppress the switching to the alternate screen by the
  <code>titeInhibit</code>, but not the associated cursor
  save/restore and clear-screen operations.</p>

  <p>XFree86 3.9s xterm implements a different set of controls
  (private setmodes 1047, 1048 and 1049) which address this (in
  addition to the older set of controls, for compatibility). The
  new set of controls implements the entire <code>ti</code>
  sequence (save cursor, switch to alternate screen, clear screen)
  and <code>te</code> (switch to normal screen, restore cursor) as
  two control sequences that can be disabled by
  <code>titeInhibit</code>.</p>

  <p>The 1049 code is a refinement of 1047 and 1048, clearing the
  alternate screen before switching to it rather than after
  switching back to the normal screen. Since <a href=
  "xterm.log.html#xterm_90">patch #90 in 1998</a> xterm allows you
  (with a popup menu entry designed to exploit this behavior) to
  switch the display back to the alternate screen to select text
  from it, to paste into the normal screen. You can also set or
  clear the <code>titeInhibit</code> resource using another popup
  menu entry (<code>Enable Alternate Screen Switching</code>).</p>

  <p>Most other terminal emulators implement only half of the
  feature. They recognize the control sequence, but do not provide
  the ability to change it at runtime, e.g., using a menu entry.
  Like any other half-done implementation, that is a bug which
  should be reported to the developers of those programs.</p>

  <h4 id="xterm_vite-id"><a name="xterm_vite" id="xterm_vite">Why
  is the cursor misplaced after running vi?</a></h4>

  <p>Vi and other full-screen applications use the termcap
  <code>ti/te</code> (terminfo <code>smcup/rmcup</code>) strings to
  initiate and end cursor addressing mode. As mentioned in the
  discussion of <a href="#xterm_tite">titeInhibit</a>, full-screen
  applications can expect the initialization string to save the
  cursor's position, and the end-string to restore it.</p>

  <p>A few applications (reportedly IRIX 5.x and 6.x
  <code>vi</code> incorrectly move the cursor before initializing
  cursor-addressing. This will cause the end-string to restore the
  cursor to its position when it was saved by the initialization
  string (typically at the upper left corner of the screen).</p>

  <p>The usual reason is due to the cursor save/restore controls in
  the <code>ti/te</code> strings. If your application runs a
  subprocess which in turn runs another full-screen application (or
  when reinitializing the screen after the shell process), it will
  save the cursor position again, so the position which is restored
  when finally exiting your program is the last one saved, not the
  first. Modern xterm (from late 1998, <a href=
  "xterm.log.html#xterm_90">patch 90</a>) changes the behavior of
  the cursor save/restore operations so they apply only to the
  current screen. That makes it less likely to misplace your
  cursor.</p>

  <h4 id="narrowproto-id"><a name="narrowproto" id=
  "narrowproto">Why doesn't the scrollbar work?</a></h4>

  <p>Originally xterm was built using imake rather than a configure
  script. One feature of imake that is not possible to guess within
  the configure script is the wide-prototype compile-time
  definition NARROWPROTO. When this is not set properly, the Athena
  widget scrollbars do not work properly. xterm's configure script
  has a fallback case which allows disabling imake. However, this
  is moot with the Xorg "modular" build, whose compiler options are
  unrelated to imake or older versions of any libraries that it may
  distribute. In this case, the configure script needs some help.
  Use this option to enable or disable NARROW proto (and disable
  imake with the --disable-imake option) to match the whims of Xorg
  hackers.</p>

  <p>For instance</p>
  <pre>
<code>        configure --disable-imake --disable-narrowproto
</code>
</pre>

  <h4 id="window_ops-id"><a name="window_ops" id="window_ops">Why
  can't my program read the window title?</a></h4>

  <p>The longstanding control sequence for reading the window title
  is something that can be abused in special conditions. For novice
  (unknowledgable) users, this can be a problem.</p>

  <p><strong>XTerm</strong> provides resource-settings and menu
  entries to allow this and related features to be enabled or
  disabled. See for example <code>allowWindowOps</code> The default
  resource settings in xterm can be overridden by a packager.
  However, a knowledgable user can override those default
  settings.</p>

  <p>It is also possible that an overzealous packager may have
  crippled xterm by removing the functionality altogether. (That
  should be reported as a bug, to me).</p>

  <p>For instance, one of those sent me a "security fix" some years
  ago, which deleted most of the control sequences which return
  data to the host. It broke the <code>resize</code> program, and
  selection, among other uses considered to be benign. In contrast,
  the same features used in other terminal emulators are tolerated
  by the same people, so rather than being a misguided attempt at
  fixing security issues, patches such as that appear to be an
  attempt at harassment.</p>

  <h4 id="window_ops2-id"><a name="window_ops2" id=
  "window_ops2">Why can't my program set the window size?</a></h4>

  <p>Some overzealous packagers, perhaps influenced by the
  demonstration I provided, are protecting you against the
  possibility of your xterm becoming inaccessible. (That's
  unlikely...).</p>

  <p>You should be able to override it, as noted above via resource
  settings or menu entry ("Allow Window Ops").</p>

  <h4><a name="compiz_bugs" id="compiz_bugs">Why is the text in the
  wrong place?</a></h4>

  <p>Are you using Ubuntu? This is a frequently-reported problem
  for Ubuntu users. With other systems, it can occur (as of
  September 2012), but is less frequent. But it has been an issue
  with Ubuntu since 2008.</p>

  <p>There are several related symptoms, e.g.,</p>

  <ul>
    <li>text may be the wrong size</li>

    <li>repainting the screen puts text in the wrong place</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here are some of the corresponding bug reports:</p>

  </ul>

  <p>Since the problem is not in xterm, all I can do is to help
  forward those bug-reports to whatever package owns
  <code>compiz</code>. What these have in common is that someone
  has written code which is tested against only a small subset of
  the X protocol.</p>

  <p>Looking for solutions (since compiz is not being fixed), it is
  possible to disable compiz. The means for doing this vary with
  time. Aside from pointing to the root cause of the problem, there
  is little advice that is useful.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For instance, <a href=
    "http://www.subcritical.org/xterm_under_compiz/">this
    comment</a> by Eric Williams suggests that the problem can be
    worked around by setting xterm's <code>borderWidth</code>
    resource to zero.</li>

    <li>other comments suggest turning off the "desktop effects" or
    "animation".</li>

    <li>On my machines using the default <em>Ubuntu</em> desktop, I
    can see misbehavior easily in Ubuntu 12.04 using <a href=
    "../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>. However, Ubuntu 12.04
    provides <em>Ubuntu&nbsp;2D</em>, which does not show those
    problems (and is noticeably faster).</li>

    <dt id="alloc_color-id"><a name="alloc_color" id=
    "alloc_color">Warning: Cannot allocate colormap entry for
    "xxx"</a></dt>

    <dd>
      This comes from the X library. Modern xterm uses the default
      color map. What this means is that if your X server has
      insufficient space to store color information for more than
      one color map, other applications which could use other color
      maps may conflict with xterm. In practice, that is 256 unique
      colors on the screen at a time&mdash;not enough for a fancy
      background or an application such as Netscape.

      <p>During resource initialization, xterm attempts to allocate
      an entry from the color map for each color which it might
      use. If there are not enough free slots in the color map, you
      will see a "Cannot allocate" message for each color that
      xterm failed to allocate. Those colors will be rendered in
      the foreground color, making full-screen color applications
      such as <a href="../dialog/dialog.html">dialog</a>
      unreadable.</p>

      <p>This problem is alleviated with <a href=
      "xterm.log.html#xterm_129">patch 129</a>, which modified
      xterm to delay the most color allocation until the colors are
      first needed. If a color is never needed (xterm allocates 20
      colors in this manner), that reduces the number of slots in
      the color map that are needed. Even with this improvement,
      xterm must still allocate 4 colors during initialization to
      determine how to display the cursor. If none of those colors
      can be allocated, xterm reverts to monochrome.</p>

  <h2 id="known_bugs-id"><a name="known_bugs" id="known_bugs">Known
  Bugs in <strong>XTerm</strong> and Look&ndash;alikes</a></h2>

  <p>These are the known bugs (or limitations) in modern xterm.
  They are also present in the other versions based on the X
  Consortium sources (color_xterm, ansi_xterm, kterm).</p>

  <p>Note that of the emulators that support color, most do not
  support <code>bce</code> (back color erase). The bce capability
  is also called the "new color model", though it has been
  implemented in the IBM PC for quite a while. Technically, not
  implementing <code>bce</code> (or allowing the choice between it
  and its complement) is not a bug, since few hardware terminals
  (with good reason) implemented this feature.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>cut/paste does not <a href="#xterm_tabs">select tabs</a>;
    instead spaces are selected. This is because the selection
    works from the array of displayed characters, on which
    tab/space conversion has already been performed.</li>

    <li>does not implement the autorepeat feature of VTxxx
    terminals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="bug_xterm_r6-id"><a name="bug_xterm_r6" id=
  "bug_xterm_r6">X11R6.3 <strong>XTerm</strong></a></h3>

  <p>The X Consortium version of xterm (and versions based on it)
  has additional bugs not in modern xterm:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the program must be run with fixed (nonproportional)
    fonts.</li>

    <li>the home and end keys do not generate usable escape
    sequences, due to an indexing error. (Note that it is possible
    to work around this using the VT100 translations resource, but
    usually this is not done).</li>

    <li>the Main Options menu is improperly constructed, due to
    incorrect indices after removing the logging toggle. This makes
    the list of signals off by one.</li>

    <li>very large screens (e.g., by using nil2 for a font) cause
    core dumps because the program uses a fixed array (200 lines)
    for adjusting pointers.</li>

    <li>certain types of key translations cause a core dump because
    the program does not check the event class before attempting to
    use events.</li>
  </ul>(These bugs are also present in the X11R5 version).

  <p>Update 2004/04/08:<br>
  Complicating this discussion is the "X.Org" xterm (from 2004).
  That is the XFree86 xterm from XFree86 CVS with all visible
  "xfree86" strings changed to "X.Org" or "xorg", depending on the
  use. For example the "xterm-xfree86" terminfo entry becomes
  "xterm-xorg". The change history for the related CVS for X.Org
  shows this. Similarly, the release notes for X11R6.7 included my
  notes for XFree86 4.4.</p>

  <p>As of 2009, it appears that "X.Org" xterm died a natural
  death, since none of the people who created it had any likelihood
  of maintaining it. Instead, X.Org defers to my version of
  xterm.</p>

  <p>This is not based on the X Consortium source. The authors

  <p>Eterm was based on rxvt, though the appearance differs. The
  terminal emulation capabilities appear similar, though I am not
  able to run the full suite of tests in <a href=
  "../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a> with this emulator (the core
  dump noted for rxvt, as well as hanging while awaiting response
  from one or more control sequences). Oddly, it appears that
  neither Eterm nor rxvt implement CPR (cursor position report).
  Finally, it reserves F1 (function-key) for a popup menu. This
  applies to versions of <em>Eterm</em> through 0.9.</p>

  <h3 id="bug_gnometerm-id"><a name="bug_gnometerm" id=
  "bug_gnometerm">GNOME TERMINAL</a> <a href=
  "http://www.gnome.org/">link</a></h3>

  <p>GNOME Terminal is developed separately from both xterm and
  rxvt, and was originally based on the zvt (zterm) widget. Like
  <a href="#bug_kvt">kvt</a>), it appears to have been developed
  imitating other terminal emulators (Linux console and xterm)
  rather than strictly emulating a VT102. The documentation is
  fragmentary (with a comment suggesting that the author does not
  know where to find relevant information), and the program fares
  badly with <a href="../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>. Beginning
  with late 1999, reports indicate that it does not properly parse
  ANSI control sequences: the vim editor is using xterm's
  vt220-style "Send Device Attributes" (Secondary DA) control
  sequence to obtain the terminal emulator's version. That is, it
  sends</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
        \E[&gt;c
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>expecting a response such as</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
        \E[&gt;0;138;0c
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>for vt100. The bug report indicates that the "c" sent by vim
  is echoed rather than interpreted by the emulator.</p>

  <p>But it suffices for vi.</p>

  <p>A more recent GNOME Terminal uses the VTE widget. I observed
  version 1.4.0.4 in late 2001, which mentioned it in the credits
  (although VTE 0.1's ChangeLog mentions no date before February
  2002). It does not implement a complete vt102: it was missing
  several features which can be demonstrated in <a href=
  "../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>). Most of the bugs in the
  Device Attributes responses remain, but it works a little better
  with vim. However, there are problems with the alternate screen
  that show up with vim. Again, these can be demonstrated with
  vttest (menu 11.6.3 in the 20011130 snapshot).</p>

  <p>Rather than evolving from zvt, VTE is largely a new work. It
  does credit zvt in one place. However, its source code uses
  xterm's source code as a resource, accounting for odd (often
  incomplete) chunks. Reviewing 0.9.0 (September 2002):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the termcap file. The last comment in the file is copied
    from xterm's source. The content of course is generated from
    ncurses with a small number of changes.</li>

    <li>the parser <code>src/vte.c</code> &mdash;a 14,125 line
    file. For example, the chunks related to DEC VT220 keyboard
    queries and DEC private modes contain comments copied from
    xterm's source code.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Later versions of VTE incorporate more features (and comments,
  symbol names, etc), from xterm's source. In some instances, the
  copied features were disabled by Red Hat's package for xterm.
  <a href=
  "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=122815">Here</a> is
  a related bug report, for key bindings.</p>

  <p>The documentation for GNOME terminal asserts:</p>

  <blockquote>
    GNOME Terminal emulates the xterm application developed by the
    X Consortium. In turn, the xterm application emulates the DEC
    VT102 terminal and also supports the DEC VT220 escape
    sequences. An escape sequence is a series of characters that
    starts with the Esc character. GNOME Terminal accepts all of
    the escape sequences that the VT102 and VT220 terminals use for
    functions such as to position the cursor and to clear the
    screen.
  </blockquote>

  <p>That sounds fine, except that it is both inaccurate and
  misleading:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>inaccurate</dt>

    <dd>
      combining the "X Consortium" and "DEC VT220", for example,
      since that was done after the demise of said organization.

      <p>It emulates a <em>subset</em> of VT100, lacks support for
      most of the VT220 control sequences (including some used for
      positioning the cursor) that are not recognized by a
      VT100.</p>

      <p>Even in the subset which it emulates, GNOME Terminal has
      bugs. Many of these are easy to demonstrate with vttest.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>misleading</dt>

    <dd>as noted in <a href="#ctlseqs_ms">Xterm Control
    Sequences</a>, xterm (mostly after "X Consortium") supports
    control sequences which are not VT100/VT220. GNOME Terminal
    implements many of these, but not all.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Perhaps that was unintentional &ndash; GNOME developers did
  not appear to document what their program <em>does</em> outside
  of that remark. However, an inspection of the changelog for
  libvte (VTE) does show that most of the borrowing from xterm is
  cited in an oblique manner &ndash; not once mentioning XFree86
  for example, leaving the impression (as indicated by "X
  Consortium") that all of the work on xterm was done before
  development of GNOME Terminal commenced.</p>

  <p>Most of this observation was documented between 2000 and 2007.
  Other than maintenance, development of GNOME Terminal appears to
  have paused in 2005. As of 2009, its maintainer is (of the
  development team), the least knowledgeable about terminal
  emulation. So there is no progress on the large number of bug
  reports related to xterm-compatibility.</p>

  <h3 id="vte_widget-id"><a name="vte_widget" id="vte_widget">Notes
  on VTE</a></h3>

  <p>VTE's README file asserts</p>

  <blockquote>
    VTE supports Unicode and character set conversion, as well as
    emulating any terminal known to the system's terminfo database.
  </blockquote>

  <p>The latter part of that ("emulating any terminal") is
  incorrect. It does have the ability to work with the standard
  function-key definitions which can be defined in a terminfo
  description.</p>

  <p>Some of the function-key logic is adapted from xterm;
  generally refactoring the xterm source-code to make it appear
  different. In places however (naming conventions and comments),
  there is some verbatim copying. The same comment is true of
  "character set conversion". None of that is reflected in VTE's
  changelog.</p>

  <p>As an aside, the credits in GNOME Terminal's "About" box also
  are inaccurate. For several years (according to its change-log),
  most of the work on VTE (the principal part of the program) was
  done by Nalin Dahyabhai.</p>

  <p>xterm on the other hand, can be told with the
  <code>tcapFunctionKeys</code> resource setting to use a more
  complete subset, based on the ncurses extended terminal
  descriptions. Even xterm's terminfo/termcap descriptions do not
  cover the (literally) thousands of keyboard combinations which
  are available via its resource settings.</p>

  <p>Outside of function-keys, VTE provides no ability to emulate
  "any terminal". A casual glance at its source code reveals the
  following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>no support for VT220-style protected areas.</li>

    <li>inconsistent support for modifier keys (the subject of
    several bug reports misdirected toward ncurses).</li>

    <li>only a subset of the standard terminfo/termcap properties
    is used (5/36 booleans, 3/33 numbers, 125/242 strings other
    than function-keys).</li>

    <li>a pervasive assumption that the terminal is something like
    xterm, e.g., to provide hardcoded behavior where termcap might
    describe something different.</li>

    <li>it uses termcap to retrieve data, rather than providing a
    choice between terminfo/termcap, opening up the problem of
    using an obsolete database.</li>

    <li>using termcap also means that it has no guidance for
    following features which are absent or have
    limited-functionality compared to terminfo, such as setting
    video attributes, colors, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For instance, VTE cannot emulate <a href=
  "#bug_dtterm">dtterm</a>, because of differences in color
  behavior. In fact, VTE does not use any of the termcap data to
  support its interpretation of color control sequences.</p>

  <p>Because of GNOME Terminal's reputation for excessive code
  bloat, developers of every other program based on VTE advertise
  their version as reduced memory usage, faster startup, etc. Here
  are a few of the available ones:</p>

  <h4 id="bug_osso_xterm-id"><a name="bug_osso_xterm" id=
  "bug_osso_xterm">osso-xterm</a> <a href=
  "https://garage.maemo.org/projects/osso-xterm/">link</a></h4>

  <p>This is one of several GUI "skins" over the VTE widget which
  forms the functional core of GNOME Terminal.</p>

  <p>Its home page refers to "at least two versions". I recall
  seeing an older version which was apparently not based on VTE.
  There does not appear to be any current page (as of 2009) for
  that version.</p>

  <h4 id="bug_roxterm-id"><a name="bug_roxterm" id=

  "bug_multignome">MULTI GNOME TERMINAL (MGT)</a> <a href=
  "http://multignometerm.sourceforge.net/">link</a></h3>

  <p>Of particular note, MGT 1.4.0 announcement claims that it
  works properly for all of <a href=
  "../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>)'s tests. On the positive
  side, it does do VT52 emulation, but (reading the source code did
  not help) it apparently does not really do VT220 from vttest's
  perspective.</p>

  <h3 id="bug_hanterm-id"><a name="bug_hanterm" id=
  "bug_hanterm">HANTERM</a> <a href=
  "http://www.bg.debian.org/Packages/frozen/x11/hanterm.html">download</a></h3>

  <p>HanTerm stands for "Hangul term" (Korean). This is based on
  the XFree86 source.</p>

  <h3 id="bug_konsole-id"><a name="bug_konsole" id=
  "bug_konsole">KONSOLE</a> <a href=
  "http://www.kde.org/">link</a></h3>

  <p>More than just a rewrite of <a href="#bug_kvt">kvt</a> into
  C++. But there are several incompatibilities between konsole
  (noted with version 1.0.2 in late 2001) and xterm:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>none of the selections of keyboard mappings match the
    actual behavior of xterm (a few come close, but do so by
    matching the terminfo descriptions rather than the programs).
    In particular, the application keypad does not send vt100-style
    escapes.</li>

    <li><a href="../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>) demonstrates
    that konsole does not properly ignore escape sequences to
    switch character sets that it does not support. Also, the
    developers of konsole did use an old version of vttest, but
    that was to add a bogus Device Attributes response (claimed to
    be for "vt220", but not corresponding to any that DEC
    produced). They do not use the newer version of vttest (which
    was available more than a year before development of konsole
    began).</li>

    <li>konsole implements several features from XFree86 xterm, but
    some are done incorrectly. In particular, the <a href=
    "#xterm_tite">private setmode 1049</a> does not save and
    restore the cursor, causing the cursor to be in unexpected
    locations after exiting a fullscreen application such as
    vi.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The problems with setmode 1049 were fixed after some time;
  other issues linger on.</p>

  <p>Like <a href="#bug_gnometerm">GNOME Terminal</a>, konsole's
  documentation is incomplete and inaccurate. This gem from its
  handbook illustrates the problem:</p>

  <blockquote>
    After a decade, Konsole is the first rewrite from the ground
    up. While xterm has definitely been hacked to death (its README
    begins with the words Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here),
    Konsole offers a fresh start using contemporary technologies
    and understanding of X.
  </blockquote>

  <p>The problem:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the remark was apparently written in 1997. It was
    inaccurate at that time, since it disregards the earlier
    xvt/rxvt applications. Limiting it only to a plain statement
    that konsole was a rewrite of <a href="#bug_kvt">kvt</a> would
    have been more accurate. Lacking that context, we find
    nonfactual articles such as <a href=
    "http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Konsole">this</a> on the
    net.</li>

    <li>for those lacking a proper education, the README was
    apparently intended to be a humorous reference to Dante's
    <em>Inferno</em>.</li>

    <li>reading konsole's source code and considering "hacked to
    death" can provide some occasion for humor. Enjoy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="bug_kterm-id"><a name="bug_kterm" id=
  "bug_kterm">KTERM</a> <a href=
  "ftp://www.x.org/contrib/applications/kterm-6.2.0.tar.gz">download</a></h3>

  <p>KTerm stands for "Kanji term" (Japanese). This is based on the
  X Consortium source, with the same bugs (though the list of
  original authors has been removed; the modifications that
  comprise kterm is relatively small).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>implements non-bce color model</li>

    <li>implements status line, but uses non-DEC escape sequences
    for this.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There is a variation of xvt (ancestor of rxvt) originally
  known as <a name="bug_kvt" id="bug_kvt">kvt</a> bundled with
  <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> which may be referred to as
  "kterm", but I do not find it interesting, other than to comment
  that it was a poor choice of name.</p>

  <h3 id="bug_mlterm-id"><a name="bug_mlterm" href=
  "http://mlterm.sourceforge.net/" id="bug_mlterm">MLTERM</a></h3>

  <p>Mlterm is not based on xterm or rxvt source, though it
  implements many of their features. It does fairly well with
  <a href="../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>, except for some odd
  misbehavior in operations that save/restore the cursor
  position.</p>

  <h3 id="bug_mterm-id"><a name="bug_mterm" id=
  "bug_mterm">MTERM</a></h3>

  <p>There are a few variants of this: the xterm bundled with some
  Motif clients is more common. More interesting, however is one
  (not Motif), attributed to "Der Mouse".</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
    (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU) Available:
    larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in

</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I saw only an incomplete version of this while it was
  advertised in the mid-90's. It is available by email from
  &lt;mouse@Rodents.Montreal.QC.CA&gt;. or via <a href=
  "ftp://ftp.rodents.montreal.qc.ca/mouse/X/mterm.src/">ftp</a>.
  This is not a patched version of xterm, though it was apparently
  written, like rxvt, to emulate vt100's. While it does have some
  interesting features (such as blinking characters), overall it
  does not do as well with <a href=
  "../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a> as the more widely known
  emulators.</p>

  <h3 id="bug_mxterm-id"><a name="bug_mxterm" id=
  "bug_mxterm">MXTERM</a></h3>

  <p>There are several variants on this: xterm adapted for Motif
  libraries. I have seen none that work properly:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/~schaft/mxterm/mxterm.html">MXTERM: a
    motif Xterm with character attributes color rendered</a> I've
    noticed this one only recently. It is a reworking of the
    earlier patches for color_xterm (credited to Erik Fortune at
    SGI) and the Motif widgets (apparently first done by Ivan M.
    Hajadi at SGI in 1991, but credited in this release to Mahesh
    Neelakanta, for Motif 1.2.4).</li>

    <li>
      <a href=
      "http://www.muquit.com/muquit/software/ansi_xterm/ansi_xterm.html">
      ANSI Xterm with Motif Scrollbar</a> Usually seen as the
      ansi-xterm-R6-motif-sb patch, I used this as the starting
      point for changes to my #82 patch of xterm in August 1998.

      <p>The original patch changes only the scrollbars to Motif,
      leaving the popup menus in Athena widgets. That was not what
      I wanted. My motivation for using Motif is not for
      performance or esthetics, of course, but to make it simpler
      to build on hosts that have no Athena widgets installed.</p>

      <p>I set those changes aside, having found (the hard way)
      that the Motif library has hardcoded behavior regarding the
      control right-mouse button. According to the O'Reilly book on
      Motif programming (volume 6), it does a server grab when
      processing menus. Making the menus behave just as in the
      Athena widgets can cause the X server to hang. (I was able to
      do this with both Lesstif and Motif libraries). Given that, I
      decided to restructure the menus entirely, making a toolbar
      which could support at compile-time either widget set.</p>
    </li>

    <li><a href=
    "http://web.archive.org/web/*/http%3A//www.fh-wilhelmshaven.de/~akcaagaa/index_mxterm.html">
    mxterm</a> This is a different reworking of the Motif widget
    patch, using a 1993 version (ignoring the more recent 1994
    patches noted above). However, it appears to have the same
    technical defect that I noted above.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="bug_nxterm-id"><a name="bug_nxterm" id=
  "bug_nxterm">NXTERM</a></h3>

  <p>Distributed with Redhat Linux 5.2, it is a repackaging of
  <a href="#bug_ansi_xterm">xterm-sb_right-ansi</a>, to use the
  Xaw3d widget set. This is based on the X Consortium X11R6 source,
  with the same bugs.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>implements non-bce color model</li>

    <li>does not implement SGR 39 and SGR 49, all attributes are
    reset when changing colors.</li>

    <li>popup menus do not appear to work.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Starting with Redhat 6.0, <em>nxterm</em> is the XFree86 3.3.6
  xterm. Unfortunately Redhat neglected to update their termcap for
  nxterm to match the program.</p>

  <h3 id="bug_rxvt-id"><a name="bug_rxvt" id="bug_rxvt">RXVT</a>
  <a href="http://www.rxvt.org/">link</a></h3>

  <p>Rxvt's manual page states the following unqualified
  comment:</p>

  <blockquote>
    rxvt, version 2.6.2, is a colour vt102 terminal emulator
    intended as an xterm(1) replacement for users who do not
    require features such as Tektronix 4014 emulation and
    toolkit-style configurability. As a result, rxvt uses much less
    swap space -- a significant advantage on a machine serving many
    X sessions.
  </blockquote>

  <p>How much is <em>much less</em>? Perhaps not as much as one
  would think from reading that. The Tektronix emulation in xterm
  (which has been optional since late 1997) accounts for about 25kb
  of the code.</p>

  <p>The toolkit-style configurability glibly referenced is the
  ability to redefine keys on the keyboard without recompiling the
  program, i.e., the <a href="#how2_fkeys">translations</a>
  resource. It also is the way mouse events and other actions are
  passed to xterm.</p>

  <p>The toolkit-style configurability accounts for about 300kb,
  which does add up if you happen to be running 50 xterm processes
  (i.e., about 10Mb).</p>

  <p>This comment was topical in December 2001:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Compared with something like GNOME Terminal, which takes 2-3
    times, or KDE konsole, which takes 15-20 times as much memory
    to run, xterm and rxvt memory requirements are
    indistinguishable to the normal user.
  </blockquote>

  <p>In June 2010, the numbers have changed somewhat. Here is a
  table showing the total application and library sizes needed for
  each of the terminal emulators on my development machine. All
  sizes are in kb (1024 bytes).</p>

  <p>Counting the libraries is appropriate, since some programs
  such as xiterm and the VTE-based programs are implemented in
  libraries.</p>

  <p>These comments apply to versions of <em>rxvt</em> through
  2.21:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>clearing the screen resets colors</li>

    <li>does not have a delete key</li>

    <li>the implementation of <code>ech</code> (erase characters)
    does not follow DEC VT220 (also ISO 6429), causing applications
    using this function to misbehave.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A newer version (upgraded to an beta as of 2.6.PRE3, however,
  since it no longer dumps core in <a href=
  "../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>) is reported to fix the
  <code>ech</code> bug. However, it is less VT100-compatible than
  the earlier versions such as 2.21b because it does not render
  reverse video (<code>DECSCNM</code>) properly. All versions do
  not update the screen frequently enough, making animation
  ineffective. See <a href="../vttest/vttest.html">vttest</a>,
  tests 1 and 2.</p>

  <p>One longstanding issue with rxvt impacts use of xterm. While
  rxvt does not use the X Toolkit (and corresponding X resource
  matching), it does read your <code>.Xdefaults</code> and
  app-defaults files to extract resource settings. That in itself
  would not be a problem. However, since rxvt also looks for
  resources in the <code>XTerm</code> class (a parasitic
  relationship like setting $TERM to "xterm" based on the
  presumption that it is a nuisance to install its configuration
  files), there have been several occasions on which xterm's
  app-defaults files have been modified to accommodate rxvt's
  variant usage.</p>

  <p>That comment applies mainly to the resource
  <strong>patterns</strong>. However, even when the pattern is
  reasonably unambiguous, but overbroad, the results can be
  conflicting. For example, some versions of rxvt may accept a
  <code>font</code> resource which does not match the XLFD pattern.
  It accepts a prefix of "xft:". This feature (apparently
  introduced by <a href="#bug_konsole">konsole</a>) tells rxvt to
  interpret the remainder of the string as a TrueType (Xft) font
  rather than a bitmap font. xterm uses the <code>faceName</code>
  resource for these values.</p>

  "bug_xgterm">XGTERM</a> <a href=
  "ftp://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/x11iraf/">link</a></h3>

  <p>It has some features which are also in color_xterm:(non-bce
  ANSI color, colorBD and colorUL resources, cursor warping, etc.
  The main feature is its Tektronix graphics emulation, which is
  the main reason for this particular program. Neither program has
  a change-log, so it is not easy to say which influenced the
  other.</p>

  <p>That is from reading the source code. However testing under
  Debian Linux, something is wrong with the resource processing
  (neither popup menus nor colors work).</p>

  <p>This appears to be rxvt 2.20, lightly reformatted, with a few
  ifdef's changed.</p>

  <p>That is, it was. The name was later appropriated by a
  different <a href=
  "http://web.archive.org/web/*/http%3A//oss.software.ibm.com/linux/projects/iterm/">
  program</a>, which also uses the name <code>iterm</code>. Like
  gnome-terminal, iterm aims to be an xterm-emulator rather than a
  VT102- or VT220-emulator.</p>

  <p>An earlier <a href=
  "http://web.archive.org/web/*/http%3A//www.openi18n.org">attempt</a>
  by the same author (the "CSI-xterm") incorporates some of the
  changes I made for XFree86 xterm via cut and paste (but does not
  mention this in its README). It is said to be the basis for
  Solaris 10 xterm.</p>

  <h2 id="building_it-id"><a name="building_it" id=

  <p>Building a copy of xterm is simple, provided that you have a
  development configuration for X11:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Header files and libraries. If you do not have the header
    files (usually under /usr/include/X11) for your system, you are
    better off building the libraries yourself. Xterm can be built
    with either X11R5 or X11R6 libraries; however X11R6 requires
    much more data to be installed before xterm will run. Xterm
    uses the <code>Xaw</code> library for popup menus.</li>

    <li>imake and <code>xmkmf</code>. These utilities produce a
    Makefile from the Imakefile. They are not essential, but
    useful, particularly on systems with unusual
    configurations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have a working <code>xmkmf</code> script (or correctly
  configured imake utility), all you need to do is type</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
        xmkmf
        make
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I have written a <em>configure</em> script for xterm which can
  use <code>imake</code> (or <code>xmkmf</code>) to generate a
  Makefile from the Makefile.in. Or it can do without
  <code>imake</code> entirely. I have restructured xterm to
  eliminate most hardcoded <code>#ifdef</code>'s, replacing them
  with definitions that can be derived with the configuration
  script. The <em>configure</em> script is more flexible than
  <em>xmkmf</em>, since it allows you to enable or disable a
  variety of features. Type</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
        configure --help
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>to get a list of options.</p>

  <p>Though I have replaced most hardcoded ifdef's with
  autoconfigured values, it will still continue to build properly
  with the imake environment.</p>

  <p>However, I usually build xterm using the configure script. By
  default, it looks for imake and will use it to help with a few
  places where a reliable configure check cannot be created. One of
  these (see <a href="#narrowproto">Why doesn't the scrollbar
  work?</a>) can be a problem.</p>

  <p>As with all of my projects, I routinely check for strict
  compiler warnings. For gcc, that is done with the "gcc-stricter"
  script which you can find <a href=
  "../scripts/readme.html">here</a>. The X libraries have a
  longstanding issue which has been ignored so far (as of
  mid-2012). To work around this (and get useful warnings), I apply
  this patch:</p>

  <p>Control sequences, i.e., programming information are in the

  "#latest_version">program source</a>. (It used to be in the same
  directory in the X distribution, but was moved to a different
  part of the tree long ago). Note that you must format this file
  with different options than a manpage, e.g.,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
        tbl ctlseqs.ms | nroff -ms &gt;ctlseqs.txt
        tbl ctlseqs.ms | groff -ms &gt;ctlseqs.ps

  <p>As a PostScript or PDF file, the individual letters of the

    <li>soft (downloadable) fonts</li>

    <li>printer interface

      <p>Done, except for the corresponding support in the VT52
      emulation. It would be nice to have a dialog to control
      this.</p>
    </li>

    <li>allow alternate libraries for popup-menus and dialogs

      <p>My configure script currently provides tests for the
      variations of Athena widgets (Xaw3D, neXtaw). I intend to
      make additional changes to support <a href=
      "#bug_mxterm">Motif scrollbars and menus</a>. Motif requires
      a different style of interface for the menus: binding a popup
      menu to control right mouse may cause the server to hang. As
      an intermediate step, I implemented a toolbar for the Athena
      widgets. In turn, that works well enough except with XFree86
      4.x: the Xaw library geometry management is broken. (Other
      implementations of the Athena widgets work well enough).</p>
