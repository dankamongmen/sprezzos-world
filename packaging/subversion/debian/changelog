subversion (1.7.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * New upstream version.
    - Refresh patches; remove obsolete no-dbus-spam, kwallet-wid,
      perl-warning, perl-compiler-flags, po, swig2-compat,
      disable-failing-tests, python-exception-syntax
    - Split patches/apr-abi into apr-abi1 (to be submitted) and
      apr-abi2 (Debian-specific).
    - Disable patches/ruby-test-info ... for now.
    - Requires serf 1.0 or higher.
  * Upstream no longer ships contrib in tarball:
    - Remove contrib-license-audit
    - subversion-tools now Recommends: svn2cl
    - Ship svn-clean, svn-fast-backup, svn_apply_autoprops,
      svn_load_dirs, commit-email.pl in debian/contrib
    - Don't ship svnmerge.py, it has outlived its usefulness
    - Delete patches/{svn2cl-*,svn-clean-ignore,commit-email}
    - Overhaul debian/copyright
  * rules: Specify that we want our own libtool.  Otherwise it finds the
    one from /usr/share/apr-1.0/build, which doesn't support C++.
  * patches/entropy: Remove as obsolete.  It was a workaround for apr
    using /dev/random, but apr switched to /dev/urandom in 1.3.
  * Move emacs plugins from subversion to subversion-tools.
  * patches/java-osgi-metadata: Add OSGi metadata to the libsvn-java
    jarfile.  Thanks Jakub Adam.  (Closes: #644438)
  * Switch from python-support to dh_python2.
  * patches/python-swig205: New patch: Adjust for swig 2.0.5+ handling of
    Python ints vs. longs.

  [ Michael Diers ]
  * More contrib adjustments:
    - Provide debian/contrib/emacs from upstream VCS contrib/client-side/emacs
    - Add svn_1.6_releasenotes.html, svn_1.7_releasenotes.html
    - subversion.docs, subversion.install
    - subversion-tools.docs, subversion-tools.manpages

subversion (1.6.18dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - patches/sasl-mem-handling: delete obsolete patch.

    Leave transition package behind for wheezy.

subversion (1.6.17dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ack NMU, thanks Ondrej.  Urgency medium because the NMU fixes RC bugs.
    - Revert libsvn-java split.  Instead, disable multiarch for libsvn-java.
      If anyone _needs_ multiarch for Java libraries, which I doubt, we
      should come up with a way to produce deterministic jar files.
    - Reintroduce specific db dependencies, so a random binNMU can't
      change the DB version without warning.
  * Disable serf support for now, as this release won't properly work with
    serf 1.0.
  * patches/g++47: New patch to build with g++ 4.7.
  * Policy 3.9.3 (no changes).
  * Move ruby files to /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby per ruby policy.

  * Split libsvn-java to libsvn-java and libsvn-jni (Closes: #670034)
  * Depend on generic libdb-dev and db-util (Closes: #621460)
  * Install java files prior to dh_install -i call

    hanging on, e.g., password prompts.  (Closes: #443860)
  * patches/python-exception-syntax: New patch: Fix a couple instances of
    literal string exceptions in Python, which don't work in 2.6+.
    (Closes: #585358)
  * Remove some preinst/postinst magic that hasn't been needed in years.
  * Split authz_svn.load away from dav_svn.load, since most users do not

  * svn-bisect: use pegs to support bisecting in deleted branches.
    Thanks Nikita Borodikhin.  (Closes: #582344)
  * patches/ruby-test-info: expand for more failures nobody can figure

    - Fixes WC out-of-sync issue.  (Closes: #500665)

    - Disable 'auth-test' test.  It assumes the gnome-keyring service
      is available at test time - not likely, on a build daemon.

    - swig-1.3.27-hack.patch: remove, obsoleted by upstream changes.
    - ruby-swig-1.3.27.patch: rename to swig-1.3.27.patch and update to
      include trunk r18172, which is likely to go in a future 1.3.x.
  * New package libsvn-doc with doxygen-generated API docs in HTML
    format.  Thanks to Max Bowsher.  (Closes: #269635)
    - Add Suggests: libsvn-doc for libsvn0-dev
  * Rename python2.3-subversion to python-subversion, recommended by
    Python policy.  This will allow for a slightly smoother global python
    transition in the future.
    - Replaces/Conflicts/Provides: python2.3-subversion
    - Use #!/usr/bin/python everywhere, not #!/usr/bin/python2.3
  * Add Provides: libsvn-dev to libsvn0-dev.  The package will be renamed
    in the future, when libsvn0 becomes libsvn1.
  * Loosen dependencies between subversion-tools and the other packages,
    as the one is "Architecture: all" and the others are not.
  * Build-Conflict with swig 1.3.28 and newer, to document reality.  This
    has been addressed by upstream trunk but not yet backported.
  * patches/neon-0.25.5.patch: new patch from upstream, to allow compiling
    with neon 0.25.5.

subversion (1.3.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Peter, Guilherme ]
  * New upstream version. (Closes: #344819)
    - Undeprecates svnserve -R (Closes: #341438)
    - Fixes typo in locks/db-logs.lock (Closes: #339298)
    - README does not mention bdb specifics when using fsfs (Closes: #295860)
    - Seems to not crash on deep directory checkouts with certain kernels.
      (Closes: #348327)
    - Back to a pristine upstream tar, as upstream has removed the
      (non-free) Subversion Book.
    - All patches rediffed / ported.
      - no_extra_libs, svn_load_dirs_symlinks: renamed to no-extra-libs,
        svn_load_dirs-symlinks, for consistency.
      - commit-email-warning, l10n-segfault: Removed (fixed upstream).

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * New packages libsvn-ruby1.8 and dummy libsvn-ruby.  (Closes: #335987)
    - patches/ruby-no-strict-aliasing.patch: new patch.
    - patches/ruby-swig-1.3.27.patch: new patch from upstream, to
      build with SWIG 1.3.27.  Upstream says this is still unofficial.
  * Disable java on kfreebsd-i386.  (Closes: #345196)
  * patches/bash_completion.patch: new patch to fix minor wildcard
    breakage with bash completion.  (Closes: #342052)
  * rules: remove x bit from /etc/bash_completion.d/subversion.
    Thanks, lintian.
  * control: downgrade db4.3-util to Suggests.
  * Move README.db4.3 and the corresponding NEWS entry to the libsvn0
    package.  Leave a symlink in /usr/share/doc/subversion/.
    (Closes: #342235)
  * README.db4.3: add notes about preserving file permissions.
    Thanks to Ross Boylan.  (Closes: #345819)
  * patches/svn_load_dirs_symlinks.patch: new patch to handle symlinks in
    the svn_load_dirs contrib script.  Thanks to Tilman Koschnick.
    (Closes: #311440, #319165)
  * rules: cleanups:
    - Use debhelper -s instead of -a, and -i -s instead of -A.
      This would have prevented the need for 1.2.3dfsg1-2.
    - Move some build rules out of the 'install' target.
    - Enable additional tests (make check-swig-py).
    - Drop use of 'time' (and corresponding build-dep in control).
  * control: move from libneon24 to libneon25, as upstream now prefers.
  * patches/no-extra-libs-2.patch: new patch: more spurious-link pruning.

subversion (1.2.3dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * rules: Remove the unwritten requirement that /usr/bin/python be
    specifically version 2.3:
    - derive python version from debian/control, not from dpkg -l
    - pass PYTHON=python2.3 explicitly into configure
  * rules: clean rule: Seek and destroy _all_ *.pyc files.  There were
    a few we didn't catch before, buried in the testsuite.
  * Remove various unneeded files from language bindings (Closes: #310777)
    - libsvn-core-perl.install: don't install /usr/lib/*.{a,la,so}
    - python2.3-subversion.install: likewise
    - libsvn-javahl.install: don't install /usr/lib/jni/*.{a,la}
    - rules: delete *.{a,la} from python2.3/site-packages/libsvn
  * control: build-depends on libapr0-dev (>= 2.0.55-3).
    Earlier versions of libapr0 will try to make us link to libdb4.2.
  * subversion.NEWS, README.db4.3: document db4.2 -> db4.3 upgrade.
  * patches/no_extra_libs.patch: new patch to prevent linking to several
    unneeded libraries.  (Closes: #336373, which was caused by linking to
    libssl0.9.8.)
    - debian/control: Remove several depends and build-depends we are no
      longer using because of this
  * patches/commit-email-warning.patch: new patch to eliminate a harmless
    warning in a hook script.  (Closes: #336781)
  * patches/perl-test-clean.patch: new patch to avoid leaving several
    /tmp/svn-perl-test-xxxxxx dirs.
  * patches/swig-1.3.27-hack.patch: new patch to avoid FTBFS from bad
    interaction of swig 1.3.27 and <apr.h>.  A *really* ugly hack.

  [ Adam Conrad ]
  * Switch to using DB4.3 instead of DB4.2, as libapr0 has
      (Closes: #335455, #335438)
    - Bump build-dep and libsvn0-dev dep from libdb4.2-dev to libdb4.3-dev
    - Bump subversion and libapache2-svn deps from db4.2-util to db4.3-util

  [ Troy Heber ]
  * Added note about the requirement for nfs-common when your repository lives
    on a NFS volume. (closes: #316097)
  * Changing the default behavior to not use apr_generate_random_bytes(),
    Debian use the system APR which is configured to use /dev/random. In cases
    where the entropy pool is drained svn commands can block waiting. Removing
    the call to apr_generate_random_bytes and using the fallback apr_time_now

  * Use DH_OPTIONS=-Nlibsvn-javahl in debian/rules, rather than the

subversion (1.2.3dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Guilherme de S. Pastore ]
  * debian/control:
    - changed section of libsvn-core-perl to perl
    - changed section of libsvn-javahl to devel
    - bump to Standards-Version 3.6.2.1 with no changes
  * debian/rules:
    - minor cleanups
    - removed remnants of control auto-generation

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * Re-repack orig tarball to eliminate the tar-in-tar arrangement
  * debian/rules: adjust to build without the tar-in-tar
    - configure and build in ./BUILD
    - 'clean' removes ./BUILD and files from autogen.sh
    - adjust a lot of installation source paths
    - pass both DEB_SRCDIR and DEB_BUILDDIR into debian/tools/Makefile
  * debian/tools/Makefile: support separate src and build dirs
  * debian/rules: modernise use of debhelper
    - use dh_install instead of dh_movefiles
    - move pathnames out of rules, into *.install, *.dirs, *.docs, *.examples
    - side effect (but correct): move libsvn_swig_* from libsvn0{,-dev}
      to python2.3-subversion and libsvn-core-perl
    - install Java libraries to /usr/lib/jni, not /usr/lib (Closes: #327789)
  * debian/rules, debian/control: disable libsvn-javahl on arm, armeb,
    mips, mipsel, on advice from Jeroen van Wolffelaar.  It seems kaffe
    may remain broken on these architectures for a while.  (Closes: #329184)
  * debian/rules: rip out "architectures to run full testsuite on" logic,
    on advice from Steve Langasek.  It is not safe to assume that
    debian-specific changes to an upstream release will never cause test
    failures.  Local admins can still use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=notest to
    speed up a local compile.
  * debian/control: relax all versioned build-deps; all the versions are
    satisfied in sarge (and most of them in woody).
  * debian/rules, debian/subversion-tools.{postinst,postrm,install}:
    - move /usr/lib/subversion to /usr/share/subversion (Closes: #330824)
    - move hot-backup.py to /usr/share/doc/subversion/examples
    - create compat symlink /usr/lib/subversion
  * debian/control: remove pkg-subversion-maintainers from Uploaders - it's
    not the right place to document the existence of a list
  * debian/control, debian/rules: build with kaffe-pthreads specifically
    (works around a FTBFS with kaffe 1.1.6)

  * Welcome the Debian Subversion Team (Closes: #322257)
  
  [ Guilherme de S. Pastore ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #320417)
    - tarball repackaged without svnbook, as it's licensed under
      a non-DFSG-free license (Closes: #215083, #218185, #314154)
    - fixes export segmentation fault with versioned items in
      "deleted" state (Closes: #314381, #316133, #316227, #320572, #324037)
  * debian/compat:
    - bump to debhelper compatibility version 4
    - no longer export DH_COMPAT from inside debian/rules
  * debian/control:
    - dropped auto-generation with m4
    - dropped build-dependency on quilt
    - bump to Standards-Version 3.6.2 with no changes
    - removed Conflicts/Replaces on all packages not present in
      stable anymore (Closes: #310519)
  * debian/patches/ltmain.sh.patch:
    - removed; applied upstream
  * debian/patches/kaffe-cast.patch:
    - removed; broken and unnecessary
  * debian/subversion.doc-base.book:
    - removed; the book is no longer present
  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Removed; was doing the work of a package description, and
      mentioned the (removed) svnbook
  * debian/python2.3-subversion.README.Debian:
    - Renamed from pythonX.Y-subversion.README.Debian, we longer
      use that auto-generation stuff
  * debian/rules:
    - tiny fixes to unbreak the build process
    - include simple-patchsys.mk from CDBS instead of using quilt;
      it was too complex for our needs
    - fixed detection of tarballs, as to not get confused by CDBS
      auto-generated lists, which would cause the build to fail
    - no longer do any magic to auto-generate debian/control and
      python related documentation; too complex for too little gain
    - set LANG to C, otherwise the build may fail because of tests
      failing for not being able to recognize strings returned by
      some tools
    - no longer do any magic to support builds on pre-sarge
      environments; the package is already complex enough without
      supporting old cruft unnecessarily
  * Removed packaging documentation, as it was pretty much outdated
  * Removed maintenance scripts from the package; left them
    on the 'tools' section of the repository on svn.debian.org

  [ David Kimdon ]
  * Do not install vc-svn.el (closes: #314213, #315100, #324633)

  * Remove hard-coded DEB_BUILDDIR from debian/rules.
  * Enable javahl bindings by default (closes: #271125, #323839)

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * debian/patches/l10n-segfault.patch:

      locales (Closes: #316143, #323376, #326079)
  * debian/patches/rpath.patch:
    - port to subversion 1.2.x and reenable (work in progress, suppresses
      most rpaths)
  * debian/lintian-overrides: new file for binary package overrides
  * debian/rules:
    - support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt
    - invent a DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=notest to disable the test suite more
      easily
    - the INSTALL file is redundant, do not install it in /usr/share/doc
    - change #!/usr/bin/env python to #!/usr/bin/python2.3 in assorted
      scripts
    - split and install lintian-overrides to appropriate packages

    - Fix directory walk ordering on filesystems that don't return
    '.' first.  (closes: #231364)
    - Many other fixes.
  * Fix description of the subversion book (it is a version control,
    not a revision control system)
  * Remove local copy of patchsys-quilt.mk and add version to quilt build-dep.
  * Don't strip binaries if 'nostrip' is in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Patch from Erno Kuusela to 50vc-svn.el so subversion vc backend doesn't
    supersede an existing default.
  * Don't ship .pyc files in pythonX.Y-subversion.  These files should instead
    be generated in the postinst. (closes: #236170)

    - Remove cvs2svn manpage.
  * Fix formatting of NEWS.Debian. (closes: #232940)
  * Put version in shlibs file.  In the last upload I removed all version
    info from the shlibs file rather than converting = to >=.
  * Enable testsuite on many archs.
  * Build with srcdir == builddir.  This fixes some problems in the
    perl bindings and generally makes the build system cleaner.
  * Remove svnadmin-static.  With the build system changes it wasn't 
    easy to keep it and we won't need it for a while if ever.

  * Mention to abbreviation 'svn' in short package descriptions.
    (closes: #231698)
  * shlibs file now creates a >= dependancy rather than a strict =.

  * Don't include svnshell.  It is just an example of how to use the 
    bindings and isn't for general consumption. (closes: #230534)
  * New package libsvn-core-perl. (closes: #208935)
  * Fix doc build by giving the new path to the docbook stylesheets.
    (closes: #231981)
  * Start using 'quilt' and part of 'cdbs' to maintain separate pataches
    within the source package.
  * Fix default repos templates. (closes: #210901)
  * Update swig build-dep to >= 1.3.21.  This isn't actually required
    by Subversion but I have some current Subversion bug reports that
    indicate mixing 1.3.19 builds with 1.3.21 systems may cause problems.
  * Pass fulll path the swig to configure so as to ensure we use the swig
    from the Debian package.
  * Don't pass broken CFLAGS to swig wrapper build (closes: #232591)

    again (closes: #230955)

    - svnserve ssh now accepts user@host (closes: #202885)
  * Rebuild against new libapr. (closes: #230311)
  * doc build has changed since the last release, update so it still builds.
  * Add build-conflicts against broken libtool 1.5-6.
  * Don't build book since the source distribution already provides
    us with a built book.
  * Build with Berkeley DB 4.2.
  * Increase required apache2 version to 2.0.48-7 so we build with the
    same version of Berkeley DB.
  * No longer install binaries that include debug symbols.
  * Autogenerated cruft is no longer part of the source package's diff.
  * Update debian/copyright notice for 2004.
  * The default /etc/subversion/config and /etc/subversion/servers are now
    generated as part of the build.
  * Link libsvn_swig_py properly. (closes: #220107)
  * Remove note from debian/control saying that this is an alpha release.

  * Change build dependancy from apache2-devb to apache2-threaded-dev.
  * Remove hack to get around broken apr-config now that bug #197685 is
    fixed.
  * Build depend on docbook-xsl rather than docbook-xsl-stylesheets.
    (closes: #220788)
  * Now that neon 0.24.4 is available increase build dependancy to require
    it.  Subversion itself doesn't require the new version but there are
    enough bug fixes in that version of neon that it is better to use it.
  * Enable mod_dav_fs in libapache2-svn.postinst (closes: #219620)
  * Fix propchange-email.pl and commit-access-control.pl interpreter
    (closes: #220692)

    somehow.  Update /etc/subversion/{config,servers}
  * Include svnadmin-static manpage.

subversion (0.30.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjust dynamic linker search path and location of svnversion 
    binary so the book build doesn't generate a spurious error message.
    As a bonus the version number in the built doc should be correct
    now instead of saying 'Draft'.
  * Set XSL_DIR when building the docs so we can find things like
    docbook.xsl. It appears as though this succeeded when I built 
    0.30.0-1 because make didn't need to recreate the documentation
    completely.  On the autobuilders this was not the case.

subversion (0.29.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force neon build dependancy and libsvn0-dev dependancy to libneon24.
    In reality neon 0.23.9 or greater will work, but since we need to 
    hard-code the version in the libsvn0-dev dependnacy it is simpler to just
    force libneon24. (closes: #206031)
  * Disable testsuite on archs where it has passed.
  * Remove unneeded, crufty shlibs.local.
  * Make debian/control read-only to discourage edits to it rather than
    debian/control.in. (closes: #211091)
  * Drop debhelper build dependancy back to >=3 so it is easier to 
    build the package on old systems.
  * Actually install NEWS.Debian rather than having it sit in the
    source package where no one can see it. (closes: #210684, #210822)
  * Update /etc/subversion/config and /etc/subversion/servers
  * Make package descriptions more clear and detailed. (closes: #210065)

    NEWS.Debian indicating steps required for Berkeley DB upgrade.
    (closes: #178819)
  * Don't include CHANGES twice. (closes: #178694) 
  * libapache2-dav-svn depends on a specific version of apache2 
    (closes: #178833)
  * Build-Dep on apache2 packages tightened to >> 2.0.44-6 since -5 
    didn't have a non-interative install, this made subversion fail on
    some autobuliders.
  * Disable testsuite on the archetectures that passed 0.17.1-1.
  * Remove version information for libapache2-dav-svn dependancy on 
    apache2 since apache2 is a virtual package.

    (closes: #174381)

    due to a bug in the shell snippet that determines whether or not we want
    it to run.
  * Change libapache2-dav-svn dependancy from apache2-common to apache2,
    we need one of the mpm's to have a working server (closes: #175902)

subversion (0.15.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. 
  * Add dependancy on libdb4.0-util for subversion and libapache2-dav-svn

  * add subversion-tools package.
  * Add subversion-server package.  This package depends on other packages
    that you probably want to have if you are setting up a Subversion server.
  * Don't ship svn-design.info anymore.  All the info we need can be
    found in the Subversion book.

    (closes: #163858)

    we can disable mod_dav_svn when libapache2-dav-svn is removed 
    (closes: #158549).
  * Use /etc/subversion/config to give us proper editor behavior rather
    than patching the C source as I had when I closed Bug#157129.
  * Patch libsvn_subr so it respects /etc/subversion/config.

subversion (0.14.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * rename apache module libapache-dav-svn -> libapache2-dav-svn 
    to indicate it is an apache2 module (closes: #158133)

  * Autotools fixes prompted by a failed autobuild and based on recomendations 
    in /usr/share/doc/autotools-dev/README.Debian.gz
    - call configure with --host and --build flags based on the output of
      dpkg-architecture
    - symlink config.{sub|guess} during build so they are always up to date.
      Add build-dep on autotools-dev.
    - Call autogen.sh when cleaning the tree.  Add versioned build-dep 
      on autoconf.
  * Remove commented python package rule and python2.2-dev build-dep. 
    (I do plan on making the python package like in subversion-snapshot 
    in the future but still need to figure some things out.)

 -- David Kimdon <dwhedon@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Aug 2002 07:42:49 -0700

subversion (0.14.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * some build fixes thanks to Jon Middleton <jjm@ixtab.org.uk>
  * libsvn0-dev priority changed from optional to extra since 
    libsvn0-dev depends on extra libdb4.0-dev and policy forbids 
    binary dependancies on packages with lower priorities.
  * libneon build dep changed (libneon-dev -> libneon21-dev)
  * Conform to policy section 12.4 (Editors and Pagers) which states 
    that if the EDITOR variable is not set the program should use 
    /usr/bin/editor when necessary.  (closes: #157129)

    this is an alpha realease.
  * remove version dependancy's from build-deps and libapache-dav-svn deps,
    the versions cause more trouble than they are worth and the proper 
    dependancy will be realized (for the most part) by way of libapr.
  * rebuild with new apache2.

    directory (closes: #153262)
  * libsvn -> libsvn0 and other fixes base on recommendations in

    is fixed, that will likely be the release after 2.0.37-2.
  * include selection from INSTALL in README.Debian
  * Make warnings in debian/control about this being in-development, 
    pre-alpha software more conspicuous.
  * Create /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dav_svn.{load|conf} symlinks in
    libapache-dav-svn.postinst if appropriate files exist in 
    /etc/apache2/mods-available.  Delete these links in
    libapache-dav-svn.postrm.
  * include identical README.Debian in subversion and libapache-dav-svn
    the info is pertinant to both packages.
  * write svnadmin manpage
