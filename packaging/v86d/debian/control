Description: daemon to run x86 code in an emulated environment
 v86d provides a backend for kernel drivers that need to execute
 x86 BIOS code. The code is executed in a controlled environment
 and the results are passed back to the kernel via the netlink
 interface.
 .
 v86d is needed by the uvesafb kernel module.
