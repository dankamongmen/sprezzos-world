Description: Gesture recognition and instantiation -- development
 The Gesture Recognition And Instantiation Library (GRAIL) consists of an
 interface and tools for handling gesture recognition and gesture
 instantiation. When a multitouch gesture is performed on a device, the
 recognizer emits one or several possible gestures. Once the context of the
 gesture is known, i.e., in what window the touches land and what gestures the
 clients of that window listen to, the instantiator delivers the matching set
 of gestures. The library handles tentative getures, i.e., buffering of events
 for several alternative gestures until a match is confirmed.
 .
 These are the materials necessary for compiling against libgrail.
