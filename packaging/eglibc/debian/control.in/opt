Package: libc6-i686
Architecture: i386
Section: libs
Priority: extra
Multi-Arch: same
Pre-Depends: libc6 (= ${binary:Version})
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Embedded GNU C Library: Shared libraries [i686 optimized]
 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for i686 machines, and will only be
 used on an i686 class CPU (check the output of `uname -m').  This includes 
 Pentium Pro, Pentium II/III/IV, Celeron CPU's and similar class CPU's
 (including clones such as AMD Athlon/Opteron, VIA C3 Nehemiah, but not VIA 
 C3 Ezra).

Description: Embedded GNU C Library: Shared libraries [Xen version]
 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for the Xen hypervisor, and will be
 selected instead when running under Xen.
