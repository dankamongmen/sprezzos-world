 /etc/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy 5e63f298721bdd4062d3c66967df99ba
Description: files and utilities common to all X servers
 The X server is the hardware interface of the X Window System.  Its job is to
 communicate with video display and input devices, and present them in a
 standardized, abstract fashion via the X protocol to X clients (X-based
 programs).  The X server largely relieves programs of having to know or care
 about the details of the hardware with which they are interacting (such
 things as 32-bit versus 8-bit color, the layout of the keyboard, how many
 buttons the mouse has, etc.).  The catch is that the X server must itself
 know the technical specifications of the graphics hardware and monitor, the
 keyboard layout, the protocol used by the mouse, and so forth.
 .
 X servers either need fonts installed on the local host, or need to know of a
 remote host that provides font services (with xfs, for instance).  The former
 means that font packages are mandatory.  The latter means that font packages
 may be gratuitous.  To err on the side of caution, install at least the
 xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, and xfonts-scalable packages.

   * Dynamic PDF generation on the web
   * High-volume corporate reporting and database publishing
   * As embeddable print engine for other applications, including a
     'report language' so that users can customize their own reports.
   * As 'build system' for complex documents with charts, tables and text
     such as management accounts, statistical reports and scientific papers
   * from XML to PDF in one step

Description: The Debian Almquist Shell
 "dash" is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than "bash".
 We take advantage of that by making it the shell on the installation
 root floppy, where space is at a premium.
 .
 It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
 somewhat faster than "bash"), or as the default shell either of root
 or of a second user with a userid of 0 (because it depends on fewer
 libraries, and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade
 problem or a disk failure).  It is also useful for checking that a
 script uses only POSIX syntax.
 .
 "bash" is a better shell for most users, since it has some nice
 features absent from "dash", and is a required part of the system.

 patch/unpatch target in the build or clean stage of debian/rules - or
 you can use the dpatch patching script directly.

 It can easily apply patches only on specific architectures if needed.

Description: API library for scanners
 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 This package includes the backends for many scanners. A libsane-extras
 package containing some not-yet-included backends is available separately.
 .
 Graphical frontends for sane are available in the packages sane and
 xsane. Command line frontend scanimage, saned and sane-find-scanner are
 available in the sane-utils package.

Description: a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix
 The Samba software suite is a collection of programs that
 implements the SMB protocol for unix systems, allowing you to serve
 files and printers to Windows, NT, OS/2 and DOS clients. This protocol
 is sometimes also referred to as the LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
 .
 This package contains all the components necessary to turn your
 Debian GNU/Linux box into a powerful file and printer server.
 .
 Currently, the Samba Debian packages consist of the following:
 .
  samba - LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix.
  samba-common - Samba common files used by both the server and the client.
  smbclient - LanManager-like simple client for Unix.
  swat - Samba Web Administration Tool
  samba-doc - Samba documentation.
  smbfs - Mount and umount commands for the smbfs (kernels 2.2.x and above).
  libpam-smbpass - pluggable authentication module for SMB password database
  libsmbclient - Shared library that allows applications to talk to SMB servers
  libsmbclient-dev - libsmbclient shared libraries
  winbind: Service to resolve user and group information from Windows NT servers
  python2.3-samba: Python bindings that allow access to various aspects of Samba
 .
 It is possible to install a subset of these packages depending on
 your particular needs. For example, to access other SMB servers you
 should only need the smbclient and samba-common packages.

Description: create dialogs that generate text through user interaction
 Kommander is a set of tools that allow you to create dynamic GUI dialogs
 that generate, based on their state, a piece of text.  The piece of text
 can be a command line to a program, any piece of code, business
 documents that contain a lot of repititious or templated text and so on.
 .
 The resulting generated text can then be executed as a command line
 program (hence the name "Kommander"), written to a file, passed to a
 script for extended processing, and literally anything else you can
 think of.  And you aren't required to write a single line of code!
 .
 This package is part of the official KDE web development module.

 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It is intended as a replacement for rlogin, rsh and rcp, and can be
 used to provide applications with a secure communication channel.

Description: the xine video player library, development packages
 This contains development files (headers, documentation and the like)
 for the xine library (libxine).
 .
 Libxine provides the complete infrastructure for a video/media player.
 It supports MPEG 1/2 and some AVI and Quicktime videos out of the box,
 so you can use it to play DVDs, (S)VCDs and most video files out there.
 It supports network streams, subtitles and even mp3 files. It's extensible
 to your heart's content via plugins for audio_out, video_out, input media,
 demuxers (stream types), audio/video and subtitle codecs.
 Building a GUI (or text based) frontend around this should be quite easy.
 The xine-ui package provides one for your convenience, so you can just
 start watching your VCDs ;-)

Description: interactive geometry program for KDE
 With this program you can do geometry on a computer just like you would
 on a blackboard in a classroom.  However the computer allows you to
 go beyond that, since KGeo is designed to do interactive geometry.
 .
 For example, the program allows you to move and change geometrical
 drawings so that you can see all the changes.  Imagine a triangle that
 can be altered into any shape you want, just by moving its corners
 around.  At the same time you can see that the angles change, but that
 they always add up to 180 degrees.

Description: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
 of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
 changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  Unlike the simpler systems,
 CVS does not just operate on one file at a time or one directory at
 a time, but operates on hierarchical collections of directories
 consisting of version controlled files.
 .
 CVS helps to manage releases and to control the concurrent editing of
 source files among multiple authors.  CVS allows triggers to
 enable/log/control various operations and works well over a wide area
 network.

 systems.  runit implements a simple three-stage concept.  Stage 1 performs
 the system's one-time initialization tasks. Stage 2 starts the system's
 uptime services (via the runsvdir program). Stage 3 handles the tasks
 necessary to shutdown and halt or reboot.
 .
 The runit programs are compiled and linked statically with the diet libc
 on architectures the diet libc is available for.
 .
 See http://smarden.org/runit/ for more information.

Description: a mail notification tool
 biff is a small program that prints a message to your terminal
 when new email arrives. Actually, the message is printed by
 the comsat daemon, and biff just enables/disables the u+x
 permission flag for the terminal, which comsat uses to determine
 whether or not to write to your terminal.
 .
 biff is mainly of historic interest, since there are much better
 alternatives (xbiff, gbiff) that are network-aware and do not
 require a daemon. Although there are no known security problems,
 running additional services is often considered risky.
 .
 By default, the biff service is disabled. To use biff email
 notification, you must enable this service by running 'update-inetd
 --enable biff' after the package is installed. You may also need
 to modify the configuration of your mail transport agent to enable
 comsat notification.

 Omega is a complex rogue-style game of dungeon exploration. Unlike other such

 include becoming the highest ranked head of a guild, sect, college, etc., as
 well as gaining the most points figured from possessions and experience. The
 game (via the oracle) may impose some structure on your exploration, but you
 need not follow all of the oracle's advice. There *is* a "total winner"
 status, by the way.

Description: An Open Source, distributed effort, data submission client
 This is the Grub crawler client, used to provide real time notification
 updates of webpage content to the distributed, Open Source project run
 and maintained at <http://grub.org/>. You will have to request a
 client-id at the homepage to let you join the force. This is needed for
 authenticated submissions to the database. Also, currently you can only
 join if you have a static IP address.
 .
 Grub, in turn, provides the returned updates to any indexing or search
 project that needs crawled content themselves. Notifications are FREE for
 public consumption, but there will be some type of charge for larger
 queries to their database, such as those needed by the larger engines. By
 centralizing and organizing the crawling process, Grub hopes to increase
 the rate at which the Internet can be crawled and simultaneously decrease
 the amount of crawler traffic required for sites wanting their content
 indexed on a regular basis.
 .
 Please don't confuse this package with the bootloader with the same name.
 It has nothing to do with it besides the name. The project is currently
 searching for a better name.

 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 This package contains libparted, the required shared library
 used by Parted.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and
 PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
 disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which
 are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16
 and FAT32) ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
 Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS,
 UFS (Sun and HP) and XFS filesystems, but cannot create,
 resize or check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install
 the libreiserfs0.3-0 package.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: The Port Scan Attack Detector
 PSAD is a collection of four lightweight system daemons written in
 Perl and in C that is designed to work with Linux firewalling code
 (iptables in the 2.4.x kernels, and ipchains in the 2.2.x kernels)
 to detect port scans. It features a set of highly configurable danger
 thresholds (with sensible defaults provided), verbose alert messages
 that include the source, destination, scanned port range, begin and
 end times, tcp flags and corresponding nmap options (Linux 2.4.x
 kernels only), reverse DNS info, email alerting, and automatic
 blocking of offending ip addresses via dynamic configuration of
 ipchains/iptables firewall rulesets.
 .
 In addition, for the 2.4.x kernels psad incorporates many
 of the tcp signatures included in Snort to detect highly suspect scans
 for:
 .
  * various backdoor programs (e.g. EvilFTP, GirlFriend, SubSeven)
  * DDoS tools (mstream, shaft)
  * advanced port scans (syn, fin, xmas) such as those made with nmap
 .

 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 This package also contains a script (called update-perl-sax-parsers)
 to manage the ParserDetails.ini file.  This script is intended to be
 used in postinst and prerm package scripts to (de)register parsers.

Description: DNS client library designed to replace the BIND res_*/dn_* library
 High-level lookups:
 .
 The dns library provides several easy-to-use DNS lookup routines:
 dns_ip4, dns_ip4_qualify, dns_name4, dns_mx, and dns_txt.
 .
 dns_ip4_qualify supports the traditional configuration mechanisms for
 hostname rewriting: $LOCALDOMAIN, /etc/resolv.conf, and gethostname. It
 also supports a powerful new user-controlled rewriting mechanism.
 .
 The functions that read /etc/resolv.conf automatically reread it every ten
 minutes, so system administrators don't have to kill long-running programs.
 .
 Low-level lookups:
 .
 The dns_domain_* and dns_packet_* functions make it easy to safely parse DNS
 packets. The dns_transmit_* functions send DNS queries of arbitrary types to
 arbitrary servers. These are the functions used in the dnscache program.
 .
 See http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/blurb/library.html for details.

Description: Update Configuration File: preserves user changes to config files.
 Debian policy states that configuration files must preserve user
 changes during package upgrade.  The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a `conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it.  This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile like handling for files that
 can not be labelled conffiles, are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead.  This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for "conffiles".
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided conffile like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 install time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: miscellaneous X clients
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of several dozen X clients
 that ship with the X Window System, including:
  - startx and xinit, which initialize X sessions from the command line;
  - xauth, a tool for controlling access to the X session;
  - xedit, a text editor;
  - xbiff, a tool which tells you when you have new email;
  - xcalc, a scientific calculator desktop accessory;
  - xclipboard, a tool to manage cut-and-pasted text selections;
  - xcutsel, which exchanges selection and cut buffer contents;
  - xconsole, which monitors system console messages;
  - xditview, a viewer for ditroff output;
  - xeyes, a demo program in which a pair of eyes track the pointer;
  - xfd, a tool that displays all the glyphs in a given X font;
  - xfontsel, a tool for browsing and selecting X fonts;
  - xhost, a very dangerous program that you should never use;
  - xkill, a tool for terminating misbehaving X clients;
  - xload, a monitor for the system load average;
  - xlogo, a demo program that displays the X logo;
  - xmag, which magnifies parts of the X screen;
  - xman, a manual page browser;
  - xmessage, a tool to display message or dialog boxes;
  - xrandr, a command-line interface to the RandR extension;
  - xrefresh, a tool that forces a redraw of the X screen;
  - xsetroot, a tool for tailoring the appearance of the root window;
  - xtrapchar, xtrapin, xtrapinfo, xtrapout, xtrapproto, xtrapreset, and
    xtrapstats, a group of sample clients that use the XTrap extension;
  - xvidtune, a tool for customizing X server modelines for your monitor;
  - xwd, a utility for taking window dumps ("screenshots") of the X session;
  - xwud, a viewer for window dumps created by xwd;
  - oclock and xclock, graphical clocks;
  - beforelight, a screen saver;
  - atobm, a converter from ASCII to X bitmap (.xbm) files;
  - bitmap, a monochrome bitmap file editor;
  - bmtoa, a tool that converts a monochrome bitmap to ASCII text;
  - cxpm and sxpm, tools for checking and viewing X pixmap files;
  - dpsexec, a Display PostScript program that allows the user to interact
    directly with the PostScript interpreter through a command interface
  - dpsinfo, a utility for displaying information about the DPS extension
    present in an X server or provided by a client-side DPS agent
  - glxgears, a GLX demo that draws three rotating gears, and prints
    framerate information to standard output
  - iceauth, a tool for manipulating ICE protocol authorization records;
  - texteroids, a spinning text demo for the DPS extension
  - xset, a tool for setting miscellaneous X server parameters;
  - xmodmap, a utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X;
  - xsetmode and xsetpointer, tools for handling X Input devices;
  - setxkbmap, xkbbell, xkbcomp, xkbevd, xkbprint, xkbvleds, and xkbwatch,
    tools for managing the X Keyboard Extension (XKB);
  - xsm, a session manager for X sessions;
  - smproxy, a session manager proxy for X clients that do not use the X
    session manager protocol;
  - xgamma, a tool for querying and setting a monitor's gamma correction;
  - appres, editres, listres, viewres, and xrdb, which query and update the
    X resource database;
  - Xmark, x11perf, and x11perfcomp, tools for benchmarking graphical
    operations under the X Window System;
  - fstobdf, which retrieves a font in BDF format from an X font server;
  - xcmsdb, a device color characteristic utility for the X Color Management
    System;
  - xstdcmap, a utility to selectively define standard colormap properties;
  - xev, an X event displayer;
  - xfindproxy, a tool to locate X proxy services;
  - xlsatoms, which lists interned atoms defined on an X server;
  - xlsclients, which lists client applications running on an X display;
  - xlsfonts, a server font list displayer;
  - xprop, a property displayer for X;
  - xdpyinfo, a display information utility for X;
  - xwininfo, a window information utility for X;
  - glxinfo, a GLX extension information utility for X;
  - xvinfo, an Xv extension information utility for X;
  - ico, an X graphics demo using an animated polyhedron;
  - dga, a demo program for the DGA extension; and
  - xgc, an (unfinished) X graphics demo program.
 .
 xbase-clients also -- except on the s390 architecture -- contains the XFree86
 X server configuration programs xf86cfg and xf86config, but in general the
 Debconf interface to the xserver-xfree86 package should be used instead of
 these tools.
 .
 The bitmap, editres, viewres, xbiff, xcalc, xconsole, xditview, xedit,
 xf86cfg, xman, xsetroot, and xsm programs use bitmap images provided by the
 xlibs-data package.  xkbcomp uses the XKEYBOARD (XKB) extension configuration
 data provided by the xlibs package.
 .
 xrdb requires the C preprocessor (cpp) to process X resource files.  The GNU
 C preprocessor's "-traditional" support misbehaves in early releases of the
 GCC 3.3 series; therefore, this package conflicts with those versions.
 .
 (Strictly speaking, atobm does not depend on any X libraries, but it shares a
 manual page with bitmap and bmtoa, and so is grouped with them in this
 package.)

 You are a droid out to save the universe. To do this, you must do more
 than simply blasting everything in sight - you have to transfer to better
 droids in order to conquer more advanced droids, and go through walls to
 reach parts other droids cannot reach.

 not expressed in a human-readable format--Xdelta can also apply
 these deltas to a copy of the original file.  Xdelta uses a fast,

 If you wish to update a bootdisk, or to use a bootloader to make
 installing and using the image easier, we suggest you install the latest
 fdutils (for formatting a floppy to be used as boot disk), and LILO, for a
 powerful bootloader. Of course, both these are optional.
 .
 Kernel image packages are generally produced using kernel-package,
 and it is suggested that you install that package if you wish to
 create a custom kernel from the sources. Please look at kernel-img.conf(5),
 and /usr/share/doc/kernel-package/README.gz  from the package kernel-package
 for details on how to tailor the  installation of this or any other kernel

Description: Jezzball clone for the K Desktop Environment
 This is a clone of the popular Jezzball game originally created by
 Microsoft. Jezzball is one of the rare and simple games requiring
 skill, timing, and patience in order to be successful.  A ball begins
 to bounce off of an area enclosed by four borders (like a
 square). You must move your pointer to certain areas within the
 square. Upon clicking, a new border is constructed at a relatively
 quick pace. You can change the direction of the borders by 90 degrees
 as well. Ultimately, you must force the ball to bounce around in a
 smaller, and smaller area as time goes by without the ball ever
 touching the borders as they are being constructed. If a ball touches
 a certain part of the border as it is being built, the game is over.
 After 75% of the original space has been blocked off from the moving
 ball, you advance one level, and one more ball is added to the mix in
 the following level.
 .
 This game was previously known as kjezz.

Description: A high-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: A Free command-line mp3 player, compatible with mpg123
 mpg321 is a clone of the popular mpg123 command-line mp3 player. It should
 function as a drop-in replacement for mpg123 in many cases. While some of
 the functionality of mpg123 is not yet implemented, mpg321 should function
 properly in most cases for most people, such as for frontends such as
 gqmpeg.
 .
 mpg321 is based on the mad MPEG audio decoding library. It therefore is
 highly accurate, and also uses only fixed-point calculation, making it
 more efficient on machines without a floating-point unit.
 .
 While mpg321 is not as fast as the non-free mpg123 on systems which have a
 floating point unit, it comes under a fully Free license, which allows greater
 freedom to its users. For most people who want mpg123, mpg321 is a better
 alternative.

 some AVI and Quicktime files, some network streaming methods and disc based
 media (VCD, SVCD, DVD). A more complete list can be found on
 http://xine.sf.net/.
 .
 This package contains an additional front end, aaxine, which runs even on the
 console. aaxine uses aalib to render ASCII art video, or you can tell it to
 use a framebuffer device. This is more a proof of concept, but you can use it
 to watch DVDs on your old vt100 terminal, of course. ;-)
 .
 Most DVDs on the market today are play-protected by the Content Scrambling
 System (CSS). Xine does not provide any code to descramble those DVDs,
 because of legal uncertainties. Have a look at

 password generation. It generates some random words of required type
 and prints them to standard output. This binary package contains only
 the standalone version of apg.
 Advantages:
  * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
  * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
    filter for faster access)
  * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
     1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
        FIPS 181)
     2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
        configurable modes of operation
  * Configurable password length parameters
  * Configurable amount of generated passwords
  * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
  * Support for /dev/random
  * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
  * Special parameters to use APG in script
  * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
  * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
  * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
    WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
  * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
    generation
 The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.

Description: Color lines for KDE
 KLines is a simple game. It is played by one player, so there is only
 one winner :-). You play for fun and against the high score. It was
 inspired by a well known game - "Color lines", written for DOS by
 Olga Demina, Igor Demina, Igor Ivkin and Gennady Denisov back in
 1992.
 .
 The main rules of the game are as simple as possible: you move (using
 the mouse) marbles from cell to cell and build lines (horizontal,
 vertical or diagonal). When a line contains 5 or more marbles, they
 are removed and your score grows. After each turn the computer drops
 three more marbles.

Description: Qt3 bindings for Python 2.3
 Python binding module that allows use of Qt X Window toolkit v3.
 You can use it to create portable graphics-capable scripts (there
 are PyQt versions for Linux, Windows and MacOS X).
 .
 At this moment PyQt offers a vast subset of Qt API. There are
 some minor issues related to the differences between C++ and Python
 (types, etc), but usually you'll be able to write code pretty the
 same way in both languages (with syntax differences, of course)
 .
 Python 2.3 compile.

Description: Support library and helper program for accessing odbc ini files
 This package contains the libodbcinst library from unixodbc, a library
 used by ODBC drivers for reading their configuration settings from
 /etc/odbc.ini and ~/.odbc.ini.  It is useful to provide this in
 a stand-alone package, so that all ODBC drivers in Debian can use a
 consistent ini library, regardless of whether applications are built
 with iodbc or unixodbc.
 .
 Also contained in this package is the odbcinst helper tool, which
 allows ODBC driver packages to install their own driver settings, and
 the driver setup plugins, which describe the features supported by
 individual ODBC drivers.

Description: the XFree86 X server
 The XFree86 X server is an X server for several architectures and operating
 systems; its architecture was completely redesigned for the 4.0 release, and
 features a loadable module system in which required modules are loaded on
 demand by a single server binary as opposed to the video card-specific X
 servers of the 3.x release.
 .
 The XFree86 server supports most modern graphics hardware from most vendors,
 and supersedes most version 3.x XFree86 X servers.  See
 <http://www.xfree86.org/4.3.0/Status.html> for information on its support for
 your particular hardware.
 .
 If the discover, mdetect and read-edid packages are installed, this package's
 configuration script will use them to attempt automatic configuration of the
 X server based on your information returned by your video card, mouse, and
 monitor.
 .
 Note that on the HP-PA, MIPS, and SuperH architectures, the server's
 loadable module support is not present, and therefore the XFree86 server is a
 (very large) single binary.
 .
 This package suggests the libglide2 package, which is necessary for the
 XFree86 X server's "glide" video driver to work with 3Dfx Interactive's
 Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 cards.  Users of other video cards need not
 install libglide2.

 it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
 quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.

Description: flash card learning tool for KDE
 FlashKard is based on a rather old learning method used to teach
 children facts.  The teacher will present a number of cards with
 questions on it, on which the pupil will write down the answers on the
 back of the cards, which will be checked later on by the teacher.  The
 cards with the correct answers will be removed from the pile and the
 incorrectly answered questions will be repeated over and over again,
 until the answer is "drilled" into the memory.
 .
 FlashKard is an easy to use application for children who can read and
 write words using a keyboard.  Depending on the level of questions,
 FlashKard is suitable for adults as well, for example to learn
 languages.  You really can "drill" words into your brain over and over
 again.  The computer is the most patient teacher you ever can have.

Description: pool-based Debian package archiver
 DebPool is a package archive maintenance utility designed with a goal of
 removing any dependency on code not shipped as part of the core Debian
 system.
 .
 It is capable of all of the following:
   * Tracking multiple distributions (however, it does *not* include
     unstable -> testing promotion scripts).
   * Generating Release files (requires libdigest-{md5,sha1}-perl)
   * Verifying package signatures (requires gnupg).
   * Signing release files (requires Release files and gnupg).
   * Running in single-pass or daemon modes.
 .
 DebPool is intended to be a lightweight replacement for the full Debian
 archival scripts, in the tradition of debarchive and mini-dinstall, but
 using a pool layout and avoiding external dependencies.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system
 D-BUS is a message bus, used for sending messages between
 applications.  Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets
 and CORBA in terms of complexity.
 .
 D-BUS supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more.  It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML.  D-BUS also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 D-BUS is still under heavy development, but is expected to be widely
 used.  It comes with several interfaces, including GLib.  See the
 description of dbus-glib-1 for more information about those.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides two commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator, and uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the xutils
 package.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xlibs-data package.

Description: Potato Guy for KDE
 KTuberling is a game intended for small children. Of course, it may

 It is a potato editor. That means that you can drag and drop eyes,
 mouths, moustache, and other parts of face and goodies onto a
 potato-like guy.  Similarly, you have a penguin on which you can drop
 other stuff.
 .
 There is no winner for the game. The only purpose is to make the
 funniest faces you can.
 .
 There is a museum (like a "Madame Tusseau" gallery) where you can
 find many funny examples of decorated potatoes. Of course, you can
 send your own creations to the programmer, Eric Bischoff, who will
 include them in the museum if he gets some spare time.

 leap years are, when they occur, how the week numbers are defined,
 what's the first day of the week, how many weeks (52 or 53) a given
 year has, and so on.

Description: X Window System (XFree86) infrastructure
 xfree86-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration.
 .
 Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will
 also require the xserver-common package and an X server package (most
 likely xserver-xfree86).
 .
 The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries
 (the xlibs package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages,
 and likely many more client packages.
 .
 Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts
 of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages.
 For convenience, the "x-window-system" metapackage will include everything
 that is required for a standalone X workstation.
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.4".  The version of X used in Debian
 is derived from the version released by the XFree86 Project, Inc., and is
 thus often also referred to as "XFree86".  All of the preceding quoted terms
 are functionally interchangeable in a Debian system.
 .
 Still confused?  Install this package and then read the files in
 /usr/share/doc/xfree86-common/ for assistance.

Description: PCMCIA Card Services for Linux
 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded
 capabilities, such as modems, increased memory, etc.  Some desktop PCs
 can accept PCMCIA cards as well, although this is rare.
 .
 This package provides the card manager daemon that can respond to card
 insertion and removal events, loading and unloading drivers on demand.
 It supports ``hot swapping'' of most PCMCIA cards, so cards can be
 inserted and ejected at any time.
 .
 The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained
 in either the pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package or the
 kernel-pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package, where <kernel
 version> is the version of the kernel for which the modules have
 been compiled.  The pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package contains
 the drivers that were compiled from this package's source.  The
 kernel-pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package contains the drivers
 that compiled from the (version 2.4 or later) kernel source.
 .
 Since version 2.4 (and later) kernels have their own drivers, they can
 be built with their own PCMCIA support.  Nevertheless, this package or
 the hotplug package is still required to load and unload drivers on
 demand.
 .
 The ifupdown package can be used to configure PCMCIA network
 interfaces.  The wireless-tools package is required by many wireless
 network adapters.  The hotplug package is required by 2.4 (and later)
 series kernels to use PCI (Cardbus) devices.

Description: Nameserver information manager
 Resolvconf is a framework for keeping track of the system's
 information about currently available nameservers. It sets
 itself up as the intermediary between programs that supply
 nameserver information and programs that use nameserver
 information. Examples of programs that supply nameserver
 information are: ifupdown, DHCP clients, the PPP daemon and
 local nameservers. Examples of programs that use this
 information are: DNS caches, resolver libraries and the
 programs that use them.
 .
 This package may require some manual configuration.  Please

Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software,generic shared
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 The libraries in this package are built without any processor extension
 instructions, and should run on all processors of this general
 architecture, albeit less than optimally.
 .
 On some architectures, multiple binary packages are provided to take
 advantage of certain commonly available processor instruction set
 extensions.  The instruction extension set used is indicated in the
 package name, with 'base' denoting no extensions. In general, you
 will obtain the best performance by installing the package with the
 most advanced instruction extension set your machine is capable of
 running.

Description: Lists critical bugs before each apt installation
 apt-listbugs is a tool which retrieves bug reports from the Debian
 Bug Tracking System and lists them. Especially, it is intended to
 be invoked before each upgrade/installation by apt in order to check
 whether the upgrade/installation is safe.
 .
 Most of Debian developers use the unstable version of Debian
 and some users also use it because the version is the latest
 snapshot which includes many new features and packages.
 .
 apt is a great convenient tool to follow your system to the latest
 version easily. On the other hand, the feature also makes your system
 break easily. If a package is broken and uploaded to the Debian unstable,
 the package will be installed on many Debian system soon.
 .
 This tool aims to make the broken upgrade as safe as possible. You can
 check whether the upgrade is safe or not just before the upgrade.

 Resource Identifier (URI) references as specified in RFC 2396.
 .
 URI objects can be used to access and manipulate the various
 components that make up these strings.  There are also methods to
 combine URIs in various ways.
 .
 The URI class replace the URI::URL class that used to be distributed
 with libwww-perl.  This package contains an emulation of the old
 URI::URL interface.  The emulated URI::URL implement both the old and
 the new interface.

Description: standard SGML representation system for technical documents
 DocBook is an SGML document type definition (DTD) that is well-suited
 to books, articles, or reference documentation about technical
 matters, systems, or software (although it is by no means limited to
 these applications).  It has emerged as an open and standard DTD in the
 software industry, and is used as the documentation system of choice
 for many free software projects.
 .
 This package contains the SGML DTD for DocBook, which describes
 the formal structure for documents following this format.  If you
 wish to author DocBook documents using XML rather than SGML, use the
 'docbook-xml' package.  You will need other packages in order to edit
 (psgml), validate (opensp) or format (docbook-xsl, docbook-dsssl)
 DocBook documents.
 .
 This package includes the 2.4.1, 3.0, 3.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 versions
 of the DocBook SGML DTD.

 techniques, and advanced package browsing functions in programs that
 support it.
 .
 This package has been made as a way to deploy and test package tags
 support until it gets integrated in the normal Debian workflow.

 GNOME is a project to build a complete, user-friendly desktop based
 entirely on free software.
 .
 A canvas appears as a normal GTK+ widget with its own GDK window (or X
 window).
 .
 The programmer can insert graphical items into the canvas. The canvas
 provides several predefined item types, including lines, rectangles,
 ellipses, polygons, and text. Canvas items can be manipulated after they
 are created and inserted into the canvas. Common operations include
 changing the color of an item or moving it to a different position.
 .
 The canvas takes care of all drawing operations so that it never flickers,
 and so that the user does not have to worry about repainting the items he
 or she wants to display.

Description: Programs for counting physical source lines of code (SLOC)
 SLOCCount (pronounced "sloc-count") is a suite of programs for counting
 physical source lines of code (SLOC) in potentially large software systems
 (thus, SLOCCount is a "software metrics tool" or "software measurement tool").
 SLOCCount can count physical SLOC for a wide number of languages;
 listed alphabetically, they are: Ada, Assembly, awk, Bourne shell, C, C++,
 C shell, COBOL, C#, Expect, Fortran, Java, lex/flex, LISP (including Scheme),
 Makefile, Modula3, Objective-C, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, sed, SQL,
 TCL, Yacc/Bison.
 SLOCCount can automatically determine if a file
 is a source code file or not, and if so, which language it's written in.
 As a result, you can analyze large systems completely automatically.
 SLOCCount also includes some report-generating tools
 to collect the data generated and present it in several different formats.

Description: Download Debian CD images from any Debian mirror
 Using the jigdo-lite script contained in this package, you can use
 your nearest "regular" Debian mirror to download Debian CD images,
 instead of having to use one of the few, slow, overloaded mirrors
 that offer the images as direct HTTP or FTP downloads. See
 <http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/> for details.
 .
 Jigsaw Download, or short jigdo, is a scheme developed primarily to
 make it easy to distribute huge filesystem images (e.g. CD (ISO9660)
 or DVD (UDF) images) over the internet, but it could also be used for
 other data which is awkward to handle due to its size, like
 audio/video files or large software packages.
 .
 jigdo tries to ensure that the large file is downloaded in small
 parts which can be stored on different servers. People who want to
 download the image do so by telling the jigdo download tool to
 process one ".jigdo" file; using it, jigdo downloads the parts and
 reassembles the image. jigdo-file is used to prepare the files for
 download.

Description: Add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the adduser and deluser commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
 o Adduser can create new users and groups and add existing users to
   existing groups.
 o Deluser can remove users and groups and remove users from a given
   group.
 .
 Adding users with adduser is much easier than adding them by hand.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, allow you to set an
 initial password and the GECOS field.
 .
 Deluser can optionally remove and backup the user's home directory
 and mail spool or all files on the system owned by him.
 .
 Optionally a custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .
 Adduser is maintained on http://alioth.debian.org/projects/adduser/.
 There is also a development mailing list on
 http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/adduser-devel/.

Description: ODBC driver for PostgreSQL
 This package provides a driver that allows ODBC-enabled applications to
 access PostgreSQL databases.  ODBC is an abstraction layer that allows
 applications written for that layer to access databases in an manner
 that is relatively independent of the particular database management
 system.  PostgreSQL is an open-source SQL database management system,
 which can be accessed using this driver.
 .
 You need to install this package if you want to use an application that
 provides database access through ODBC and you want that application to
 access a PostgreSQL database.  This package would need to be installed
 on the same machine as that client application; the PostgreSQL database
 server can be on a different machine and does not need any additional
 software to accept ODBC clients.
 .
 If you want to write software that can access a database through the
 ODBC abstraction layer, you need to install the unixODBC driver manager
 development package unixodbc-dev, and possibly additional packages for
 language bindings.  This driver package is only used at run time.

Description: vocabulary trainer for KDE
 KVocTrain is a little utility to help you train your vocabulary when you
 are trying to learn a foreign language.  You can create your own database
 with the words you need.  It is intended as a replacement for index
 (flash) cards.
 .
 You probably remember flashcards from school.  The teacher would write the
 original expression on the front side of the card and the translation on
 the back.  Then look at the cards one after another.  If you knew the
 translation, you could put it away.  If you failed, you put it back to
 try again.
 .
 KVocTrain is not intended to teach you grammer or other sophisticated
 things.  This is and probably will stay beyond the scope of this application.
 .
 This package is part of the official KDE edutainment module.

 Toppler is an almost complete reimplementation of the old game known as

 The target of the game is to reach the target door of each of the  8 towers
 in currently 2 missions with this little green animal. This door is usually
 at the very top of the tower.
 .
 But finding the way by using elevators and walking through a maze of doors
 and platforms is not the only problem you have to solve. There are a bunch
 of other creatures living on the tower that will hinder you to reach your
 target by pushing you over the edge of the platforms.

Description: X display manager
 xdm manages a collection of X servers, which may be on the local host or
 remote machines.  It provides services similar to those provided by init,
 getty, and login on character-based terminals: prompting for login name and
 password, authenticating the user, and running a session.  xdm supports XDMCP
 (X Display Manager Control Protocol) and can also be used to run a chooser
 process which presents the user with a menu of possible hosts that offer
 XDMCP display management.
 .
 If the xutils package is installed, xdm can use the sessreg utility to
 register login sessions to the system utmp file; this, however, is not
 necessary for xdm to function.
 .
 xdm requires the C preprocessor (cpp) to process its configuration files.
 The GNU C preprocessor's "-traditional" support misbehaves in early releases
 of the GCC 3.3 series; therefore, this package conflicts with those versions.

Description: Display change history from .deb archives
 apt-listchanges is a tool to show what has been changed in a new
 version of a Debian package, as compared to the version currently
 installed on the system.  It does this by extracting the relevant
 entries from the Debian changelog file, and the NEWS.Debian file.
 .
 It can be run on several .deb archives at a time to get a list of all
 of the changes that would be effected by installing or upgrading a
 group of packages.  It can be configured to do this automatically
 during upgrades using apt.

Description: A fast lexical analyzer generator.
 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.
 .
 The behaviour of Flex has undergone a major change since version
 2.5.4a; Flex scanners are now reenterant, you may have multiple
 scanners in the same program with differing sets of defaults, and
 they play nicer with modern C and C++ compilers. The Flip side is
 that Flex no longer conforms to the POSIX lex behaviour, and the
 scanners require conforming implementations when flex is used in ANSI
 C mode. The package flex-old provides the older behaviour.
 .
 This product includes software developed by the University of California,
 Berkeley and its contributors. The upstream source code can be found at
 http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lex/flex-2.5.31.tar.bz2?download

 Kernel image packages are generally produced using kernel-package,
 and it is suggested that you install that package if you wish to
 create a custom kernel from the sources.

Description: Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) daemon
 The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard way to transmit
 datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard way for the machines
 at either end of the link (the "peers") to negotiate various optional
 characteristics of the link.  Using PPP, a serial link can be used to
 transmit Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams, allowing TCP/IP connections
 between the peers.

Description: X Window System client libraries metapackage and XKB data
 This package smooths upgrades from Debian 3.0 by depending on the individual
 library packages into which each shared object formerly contained in this
 package has been split.
 .
 This package is only depended upon by packages that haven't yet been compiled
 against the new shared library packages.
 .
 This package also contains configuration data used by the X Keyboard
 Extension (XKB).  Other architecture-independent data used by X libraries can
 be found in the xlibs-data package.

Description: The GNU Parted disk partition resizing program
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
 resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and
 PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
 disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which
 are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16
 and FAT32) ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
 Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS,
 UFS (Sun and HP) and XFS filesystems, but cannot create,
 resize or check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install
 the libreiserfs0.3-0 package.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed. however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends
 .
 This package contains the Pango modules and the configuration files
 which Pango needs.

 Smbfs is a filesystem which understands the SMB protocol.
 This is the protocol Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT or
 LAN Manager use to talk to each other. It was inspired by
 samba, the program by Andrew Tridgell that turns any unix
 site into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.
 .
 If you want to use command-line utilities like smbclient, smbtar
 and/or smbspool you just need to install the smbclient package.
 .
 Starting with the Debian Samba packages version 2.2.0-1, the old smbfs
 utilities for 2.0.x have been removed. There are no wrapper scripts
 that call a specific smbmount/smbumount depending on the kernel
 version.  If you are using a 2.0.x kernel please upgrade or use the
 latest Samba 2.0.7 Debian package.

Description: Qt3 bindings for Python 2.3
 Python binding module that allows use of Qt X Window toolkit v3.
 You can use it to create portable graphics-capable scripts (there
 are PyQt versions for Linux, Windows and MacOS X).
 .
 At this moment PyQt offers a vast subset of Qt API. There are
 some minor issues related to the differences between C++ and Python
 (types, etc), but usually you'll be able to write code pretty the
 same way in both languages (with syntax differences, of course)
 .

 Basically it provides much the same info as QObject::dumpObjectTree() and
 QObject::dumpObjectInfo(), but in a much more convenient form.  KSpy has
 minimal overhead for the application, because the kspy library is
 loaded dynamically using KLibLoader.

 If you wish to update a bootdisk, or to use a bootloader to make
 installing and using the image easier, we suggest you install the latest
 fdutils (for formatting a floppy to be used as boot disk), and LILO, for a
 powerful bootloader. Of course, both these are optional.

 Kernel image packages are generally produced using kernel-package,
 and it is suggested that you install that package if you wish to
 create a custom kernel from the sources.

Description: standard fonts for X
 xfonts-base provides a standard set of low-resolution bitmapped fonts.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains primarily fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  (A small selection of fonts in ISO
 8859-8, JIS-X0208.1983, JIS-X0208.1976, and GB2312.1980 fonts are also
 included.)  For other encodings, see the xfonts-base-transcoded package.
 .
 If you are not using a remote font server, you must install this package if
 you are installing an X server.  It contains fonts without which X servers
 will not work.
 .
 This package also provides a set of files that can be used by the X or
 fonts server to transcode fonts from one encoding to another (e.g., KOI8-R
 to ISO-8859-5).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.

Description: Common files for different Ghostscript releases
 There are three different flavors of the Ghostscript PostScript
 interpreter, released under different licenses:
 .
 GPL Ghostscript: Free software released under the GNU GPL. This
 flavor is included in Debian as the "gs-gpl" package.
 .
 ESP Ghostscript: Free software released under the GNU GPL. This
 version of Ghostscript is maintained and enhanced by Easy Software
 Products et. al., and supposed to be well-suited to the CUPS.  This
 flavor is included in Debian as the "gs-esp" package.
 .
 AFPL Ghostscript: This flavour is the more current and more up to
 date one but under a license that is not DFSG-free. If you want to
 use this package please make sure that you agree to the license. The
 AFPL variant of Ghostscript is not part of the official Debian
 distribution but we provide a package for it in the non-free section
 as a service to our users.  This flavor is called the "gs-afpl"
 package.
 .
 This package contains the common files among these flavors for
 managing the font installation and some wrapper scripts.

 .
  - R5RS support.
  - SRFIs 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 22 and 23
  - Syntax-case highlevel macros
  - Lightweight threads based on first-class continuations
  - Pattern matching with Andrew Wright's match package
  - Record structures
  - A simple and straightforward module system
  - An object system with multiple inheritance, multimethods and a
    meta-object protocol
  - Separated compilation poses no problem and full tail-recursion and
    first-class continuations are supported.
  - Extended comment- and string-literal syntaxes
  - Libraries for regular expressions, string handling, Common LISP
    style format, UNIX system calls and extended data structures
  - Create interpreted or compiled shell scripts written in Scheme
  - Compiled C files can be easily distributed
  - Generates quite portable C code and compiled files generated by it
    (including itself) should work without any change on DOS, Windows,
    most UNIX-like platforms, and with minor changes on other systems.
  - Linkage to C modules and C library functions is straightforward.
    Compiled programs can easily be embedded into existing C code.
  - Simple. It can be used as a pedagogical tool for anybody who is
    interested in the workings of a compiler.
  - Extendable, since its code generation scheme, runtime system, and
    garbage collector fit neatly into a C environment.
  - Offers better performance than nearly all interpreter based
    implementations, but still provides full Scheme semantics.
  - Probably is the first implementation of Scheme that uses Henry
    Baker's [Cheney on the M.T.A] concept.

Description: Client to configure an IPv6 tunnel to freenet6
 Providing tspc, a Tunnel Server Protocol Client, this Package allows an easy
 way to connect the machine to the 6bone.
 .
 Configured tunneling is a transition method standardized by IETF to use IPv6
 in coexistence with IPv4 by encapsulating IPv6 packets over IPv4. Any host
 already connected to Internet with IPv4 which has an IPv6 stack can establish
 a link to the Internet IPv6.
 .
 FREENET6's TSP is a new model based on a client/server approach. A protocol is
 used to request a single IPv6 address to a full IPv6 prefix from a client to a
 tunnel server according to the IPv6 broker model.

 Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface for
 packet capture, and since there are several tools that require this
 functionality, we've created this system-independent API to ease in
 porting and to alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet
 capture modules in each application.

Description: ClanLib game SDK core runtime
 ClanLib is a multi-platform software development kit, with an emphasis on
 game development.
 .
 On one side, it tries to provide a platform independent interface to
 write games with, by taking over the low-level work from the game and
 providing wrappers around toolkits such as DirectFB, DirectX, OpenGL,
 Vorbis, X11, etc., so that if a game is written with ClanLib, the game
 should compile on any platform supported by ClanLib without changing
 its source code.
 .
 On the other hand, ClanLib also tries to be a service-minded SDK.
 In other words, the developers have put great effort into designing
 the API, to ensure ClanLib's ease of use - while maintaining its power.
 .
 This is the runtime part of the ClanLib SDK, needed to run applications
 build with it.

 Memtest86 scans your RAM for errors.
 .
 This version is apparently not maintained any more upstream.
 Especially if you own a recent computer on which it does not work,
 you should consider looking at the memtest86+ package.
 .
 This tester runs independently of any OS - it is run at computer
 boot-up, so that it can test *all* of you memory.  You may want to
 look at `memtest' (in package `sysutils'), which allows to test
 your memory within Linux, but this one won't be able to test your
 whole RAM.
 .
 This used to be part of the hwtools package, which still contains
 another real-mode memory tester optimized for mmx machines (but less
 actively maintained).
 .
 It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel
 patch, so that you can still use you old RAM with one or 2 bad bits.
 .
 A convenience script is also provided to make a grub-based floppy or
 image.

 /etc/lintianrc caded1749ff8d0624720c64be0e79124
Description: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This also possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.6.1.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web
 using http and ftp, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp
 sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp
 retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: Secure rlogin/rsh/rcp replacement (OpenSSH with Kerberos)
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It is intended as a replacement for rlogin, rsh and rcp, and can be
 used to provide applications with a secure communication channel.
 .
 This version of OpenSSH has been compiled with patches enabling
 Kerberos authentication for protocol versions 1 and 2.
 This package provides both the ssh client and the sshd server.

Description: Circumvent Debian package dependencies
 This package provides a tool to create Debian
 packages that only contain dependency information.
 .
 If a package P is not installed on the system, packages
 that depend on P cannot normally be installed.  However,
 if equivalent functionality to P is known to be installed,
 this tool can be used to trick the Debian package management
 system into believing that package P is actually installed.
 .
 Another possibility is creation of a meta package. When this
 package contains a dependency as "Depends: a, b, c", then
 installing this package will also select packages a, b and c.
 Instead of "Depends", you can also use "Recommends:" or
 "Suggests:" for less demanding dependency.
 .
 Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used,
 it might possibly do damage to your packaging system. And please
 note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing
 with broken dependencies. Better file a bug report instead.

 Part of the Boost.org library collection.
 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.
 .

 is that you write a test method that makes certain assertions about
 your code, working against a test fixture. A bunch of these test
 methods are bundled up into a test suite and can be run any time the
 developer wants. The results of a run are gathered in a test result
 and displayed to the user through some UI. Test::Unit also has a
 compatibility layer for RubyUnit, the old unit testing framework for
 Ruby.

 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: A variant of Nethack
 Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack - Extended Magic (SLASH'EM)
 is a role-playing game where you control a single character. The
 interface and gameplay are similar in style to Rogue, ADOM, Angband
 and, of course, Nethack. You control the actions through the
 keyboard and view the world from an overhead perspective.
 .
 The problem: The Amulet of Yendor has been stolen. Not only
 that but it appears that the Wizard of Yendor (not a nice person),
 who took the amulet, is hiding in the Dungeons of Doom (not a
 friendly place).
 .
 Enhancements over Nethack includes:
    - New roles
    - New skill system
    - Riding pets
    - New special levels

Description: MikMod module for ClanLib game SDK
 ClanLib delivers a platform independent interface to write games with.
 If a game is written with ClanLib, it should be possible to compile the
 game under any platform (supported by ClanLib, that is) without changing
 the application source code.
 .
 But ClanLib is not just a wrapper library, providing a common interface
 to low-level libraries such as DirectFB, DirectX, OpenGL, X11, etc. While
 platform independence is ClanLib's primary goal, it also tries to be a
 service-minded game SDK. In other words, we have put great effort into
 designing the API, to ensure ClanLib's ease of use - while maintaining its
 power.
 .
 This package contains the MikMod module (clanMikMod).

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the

 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: Runtime files for the OpenEXR image library
 OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
 Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
 .
 OpenEXR's features include:
    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and
      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.
 This package contains the following shared libraries:
    * IlmImf - a library that reads and writes OpenEXR images.
    * Imath - a math library with support for matrices, 2D and
      3D transformations, solvers for linear/quadratic/cubic
      equations, and more.

Description: a free software desktop page layout program
 Scribus is a desktop page layout program for GNU/Linux similar to
 Corel Ventura(R), Quark Xpress(R), Adobe PageMaker(R) and InDesign(R).
 .
 Scribus can be used for many tasks; from brochure design to newspapers,
 magazines, newsletters and posters to technical documentation. It has
 sophisticated page layout features like precision placing and rotating of text
 and/or images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier curves polygons,
 precision placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom colors. The
 Scribus document file format is XML-based. Unlike proprietary binary file
 formats, even damaged documents, can be recovered with a simple text editor.
 .
 Scribus supports professional DTP features, such as CMYK color and a
 color management system to soft proof images for high quality color printing,
 flexible PDF creation options, Encapsulated PostScript import/export and
 creation of 4 color separations, import of EPS/PS and SVG as native vector
 graphics, Unicode text including right to left scripts such as Arabic and
 Hebrew via freetype. Graphic formats which can be placed in Scribus as images
 include PDF, Encapsulated Post Script (eps), TIFF, JPEG, PNG and XPixMap(xpm),
 and any bitmap type supported by QT3.
 .
 Printing, PDF and SVG creation are done via custom driver libraries and
 plug-ins, giving Scribus inventive features: the abilities to include
 presentation effects with PDF output, fully scriptable interactive PDF
 forms, SVG vector file output. The internal printer drivers fully support
 Level 2 and Level 3/PDF 1.4 postscript features including transparency and
 font embedding.
 .
 When run from KDE, Drag and Drop, for example from desktop to the canvas,
 is enabled. There is easy to use drag and drop scrapbook for frequently
 used items such as text blocks, pictures and custom shaped frames.

Description: personal package builder for Debian packages
 pbuilder constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the
 chroot.
 It is an ideal system to use to check
 that a package has correct build-dependencies.
 It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection
 to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary.
 .
 "pbuilder create" uses debootstrap to create a chroot image.
 .
 "pbuilder update" updates the image to the current state of
 testing/unstable/whatever
 .
 "pbuilder build" takes a *.dsc file and builds a binary in the chroot
 image.
 .
 pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian Developers, to allow running
 pbuilder just like "debuild", as a normal user.

 Foomatic is a printer database designed to make it easier to set up
 common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems).
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 your actual printer, by telling your computer how to process files
 sent to the printer.
 .
 This package consists of filter scripts used by the printer spoolers
 to convert the incoming PostScript data into the printer's native
 format using a printer-specific, but spooler-independent PPD file.
 You will need to install the foomatic-db-engine package and its
 dependencies for this package to be useful.
 .
 For use with CUPS, you will need both the cupsys and cupsys-client
 packages installed on your system.

Description: The Ultimate Movie Player For Linux
 It plays most mpeg, avi and asf files, supported by many native and win32
 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and even DivX movies too. The another
 big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. It
 works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, but you can use SDL (and
 this way all drivers of SDL) and some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for
 Matrox/3dfx/SiS) too! Most of them supports software or hardware scaling,
 so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.

Description: Qt-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the Qt tool kit, so it is especially suitable for users of KDE.
 If the X Window System is not active then an alternative text-mode
 dialog will be used.  There are sibling packages that implement PIN
 entry dialogs using other tool kits.

Description: KDE personal organizer
 A complete calendar and scheduling program. KOrganizer supports information
 interchange with other calendar applications through the industry standard
 vCalendar file format.
 .
 KOrganizer aims to be a complete program for organizing your appointments,
 contacts, projects, etc. It is in the same spirit as similar programs like
 the now ubiquitous Microsoft Outlook, Starfish Internet Sidekick,
 Time & Chaos, etc. (all for the Microsoft Windows platform, of course.) Best
 of all, It reads and writes the vCalendar file format NATIVELY (please see
 http://www.imc.org/pdi for more information), which is now an industry-wide
 personal data interchange format. Because of this, you should be able to move
 from other modern PIMs to KOrganizer with relative ease. Current users of the
 popular program ical should definitely take a look at KOrganizer and compare
 features.
 .
 KOrganizer also offers full synchronization with your Palm Pilot, if you have
 kpilot installed.
 .
 This package is part of the official KDE pim module.

 .
 It has an integrated help system and can run one of four
 modes (beginning, intermediate, advanced, complete).  Each
 level exposes successively more features and options to the
 user.  The goal of this configuration is to protect novice users
 from the more arcane behavior of Scheme under certain cases.

Description: 75 dpi fonts for X
 xfonts-75dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 75 dots per inch.  In most
 cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains only fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  For other encodings, see the
 xfonts-75dpi-transcoded package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-100dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-75dpi may be more suitable for small monitors and/or small
 screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.

 This package contains the Linux kernel image for version 2.6.4 on
 Pentium Pro/Celeron/Pentium II/Pentium III/Pentium IV,

 It also contains scripts that try to ensure that the system is not left in
 a unbootable state after an update.
 .
 If you wish to update a bootdisk, or to use a bootloader to make
 installing and using the image easier, we suggest you install the latest
 fdutils (for formatting a floppy to be used as boot disk), and LILO, for a
 powerful bootloader. Of course, both these are optional.
 .
 Kernel image packages are generally produced using kernel-package,
 and it is suggested that you install that package if you wish to
 create a custom kernel from the sources.

Description: standard XML documentation system, for software and systems
 DocBook is an XML document type definition (DTD).  That is, it
 contains the "DocBook" document structure.  This is used by authors
 or editors writing documents in the DocBook XML format.  DocBook was
 designed for books, articles, or reference documentation about
 technical matters or software.  It has emerged as an open, standard
 DTD in the software industry, and is the documentation system of
 choice for many free software projects.
 .
 This package contains the XML DTD for DocBook, which describes the
 formal structure for documents following this format.  If you wish to
 author DocBook documents using SGML rather than XML, use the
 'docbook' package.  You will need other packages in order to edit
 (psgml), validate (opensp, libxml2) or format (docbook-xsl,
 docbook-dsssl) DocBook documents.
 .
 This package ships with the latest DocBook XML DTD, as well as a
 select set of legacy DTDs for use with older documents.

 books, bibliographies, comic books, videos, music, coins, stamps, trading
 cards, nd wines, and also allows custom collections. Unlimited user-defined
 fields are allowed. Names are automatically formatted, and the collection may
 be sorted by any property. Filters are available to limit the visible entries
 by definable criteria. Full customization for printing is possible through
 editing the default XSLT file. Automatic ISBN validation is included. It can
 importe CSV, BibTeX, and BibTeXML and export CSV, HTML, BibTeX, BibTeXML, and
 PilotDB.
 .
 The author started developing it when he couldn't find a personal database
 program which didn't use a SQL backend. The data is saved in XML format, which
 makes it easy to parse.

Description: virtual framebuffer X server
 xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices.  It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory.  The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment.  This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program from xbase-clients, hence the suggestion of xbase-clients.

Description: letter order game for KDE
 KMessedWords is a game that is based on the word/letter puzzles that the
 author played as a child.  A word is picked at random and displayed with
 its letters in a messed order, with difficulty dependent on the chosen level.
 You have an unlimited number of tries, and scores are kept.
 .
 It is a very simply constructed game, with 3 dificulty levels of play.
 It is fully customizable, allowing you to write in your own words and set
 your own 'look and feel' of the game.  It is aimed for children aged 10+
 because of the dificulty, but of course everyone is welcome to try.
 .
 This package is part of the official KDE edutainment module.

 formats that is, not between any two. There are handwritten assembler

 .
 An application or library that uses Hermes will for example be able to
 render into one buffer and convert it to whatever pixel format is available
 on the target platform at the time.
 .
 Other services provided by Hermes include palette handling including
 caching of lookup tables, and surface clearing to a specific colour value.

Description: X Window System protocol client library
 The libX11 library, also known as "Xlib", provides a means of communicating
 with an X server via the X protocol.
 .
 Xlib provides low-level functionality, dealing mostly with the wire protocol
 and in terms of basic operations such as opening and closing the connection
 to the X server, creating graphics contexts, drawing graphics primitives such
 as lines, arcs, and glyphs, handling events, and so forth.  A set of
 dynamically-loadable internationalization modules is also part of this
 package, though not in the libX11 shared object itself.
 .
 Application programmers who are new to the X Window System will likely find
 one of the many "Toolkit" libraries far more convenient to program against
 than Xlib directly.  Examples of popular toolkit libraries are GTK+, Qt,
 XForms, LessTif, and Athena.
 .
 libx11-6 depends on xlibs-data for locale data and the X error and keysym
 databases.

Description: Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
 The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
 other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.
 .
 xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
 backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
 storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
 dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
 attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
 thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
 and also between IRIX machines.
 .
 xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
 full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
 be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
 subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.

Description: Object-relational SQL database, descended from POSTGRES
 PostgreSQL is an object-relational database, which supports a large part
 of SQL-99.  It is under continuous development and each release implements
 more of the SQL standard, to the extent that it is now probably more compliant
 than most commercial databases.  It also supports some object-oriented
 features.
 .
 As compared to MySQL, PostgreSQL is more fully featured - most importantly,
 PostgreSQL supports transactions on all tables, something which is essential
 to multi-user update of a database, and referential integrity, which, equally,
 is essential to a reliable database.  The trade-off is that it can be slower,
 though again, each release sees improvements in efficiency and PostgreSQL
 tends to outperform MySQL when there are many simultaneous connections. For
 more information, see <http://OpenACS.org/why-not-mysql.html>.
 .
 This package provides the backend features; you need postgresql-client or
 some other front-end to be able to access them.  A package providing
 ident-server is needed if you want to authenticate remote connections with
 identd.

Description: a generic Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) parsing and manipulation toolkit
 Services provided by Libcroco
  * A parser module that provides
    o A SAC like api. SAC stands for Simple Api for CSS. SAC is an event driven
      api wich resembles SAX in the xml world.
    o A CSSOM like api. CSSOM stands for Cascading Style Sheet Object Model.
 .
    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2 specification, the CSS
    forward compatibility rules and the CSS cascading rules.
 .
  * A CSS2 selection engine
    Given an xml element node (that obviously comes from an xml document) and
    a stylesheet cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the css
    selectors of the cascade and return the style properties associated to
    the xml element node.
 .
    Note that the xml manipulation toolkit used by the libcroco selection
    engine at the moment is libxml2.

 Arkrpg is a powerful and flexible framework to create
 (networked/single player) role playing games, without having to write a
 single line of C++. All the user has to do is to create game data (models,
 textures, world), and define the behaviour NPCs, in Lua. The engine contains
 a full outdoor 3D engine, with support for skeletal animation, and
 triangle-accurate collision detection. It also contains tools to create world
 and quests, and loaders for the most common low-polygon 3D formats.

Description: MIX Development Kit
 MDK stands for MIX Development Kit, and provides tools for developing
 and executing, in a MIX virtual machine, MIXAL programs.
 .
 The MIX is Donald Knuth's mythical computer, described in the first
 volume of The Art of Computer Programming, which is programmed using
 MIXAL, the MIX assembly language.
 .
 MDK includes a MIXAL assembler (mixasm) and a MIX virtual machine
 (mixvm) with a command line interface.  In addition, a GTK+ GUI to
 mixvm, called gmixvm, and a Guile interpreter with an embedded MIX
 virtual machine called mixguile, are provided.
 .
 Using these interfaces, you can debug your MIXAL programs at source
 code level, and read/modify the contents of all the components of the
 MIX computer (including block devices, which are simulated using the
 file system).

Description: all slicker's applets
 Slicker consists of three primary items Cards, the Slider, and a
 Task-bar. Which can be used in conjunction with each other, and Kicker,
 or utilized by themselves.
 .
 Cards provide a frame work for embedded applets to be docked at the edge
 of the screen. These cards are "stackable" and provide a
 "retractable/extendable" work area.
 .
 The Slider is a corner piece to slicker, it provides a constant, "solid"
 launching pad, and is home of the miniapps.
 .
 The Task-bar is a typical taskbar with not so typical features... The
 taskbar is an "organic" app that cleanly expands or contracts as needed.

Description: a set of graph drawing tools
 Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information
 by constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
 Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
 technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and
 network design and visual interfaces in other domains. Situations where
 these tools might be particularly useful include:
 .
   * you would like to restructure a program and first need to understand
     the relationships between its types, procedures, and source files.
   * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
     individual links, but their relationships
   * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a
     finite state machine and need to figure out how a certain
     error state arises
   * you would like to browse a database schema, knowledge base, or
     distributed program represented pictorially
   * you would like to see an overview of a collection of linked documents
   * you would like to discover patterns and communities of interest in a
     database of telephone calls or e-mail messages

Description: X Window System utility programs
 xutils provides a set of utility programs shipped with the X Window System
 that do not require the X libraries; many of these programs are useful
 even on a system that does not have any X clients or X servers installed.
 .
 The programs in this package include:
  - bdftopcf, which converts BDF fonts to PCF fonts;
  - bdftruncate and ucs2any, tools to generate fonts with various encodings
    from ISO 10646-encoded fonts
  - ccmakedep, a version of makedepend which "does it right"
  - cleanlinks, a program to remove dangling symlinks and empty directories
    from a shadow link tree (created with lndir)
  - fslsfonts, a tool that lists fonts served by an X font server;
  - imake, a C preprocessor interface to the make utility;
  - lndir, a tool that creates a shadow directory of symbolic links to
    another directory tree;
  - luit, a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
    UTF-8 terminal emulator;
  - makedepend, a tool to create dependencies in makefiles;
  - makeg, a tool for making debuggable executables;
  - makepsres, a tool that creates PostScript language resource database
    files;
  - makestrs, a tool that makes string table C source and header(s);
  - mkcfm, a tool that create summaries of font metric files in CID font
    directories;
  - mkdirhier, a tool that creates a directory hierarchy;
  - mkfontdir, a program to generate fonts.dir files;
  - scanpci, a utility for retrieving information about the PCI bus and
    devices on it (not available on all architectures);
  - pcitweak, a utility that can be used to examine or change registers in
    the PCI configuration space (not available on all architectures);
  - pswrap, a tool that creates C procedures from segments of PostScript
    language code;
  - resize, which prints a shell command for setting the TERM and TERMCAP
    environment variables to indicate the current size of the xterm (or
    compatible program) window from which the command is run;
  - revpath, which generates a relative path that can be used to undo a
    change-directory;
  - rstart, a remote start client;
  - rstartd, a remote start daemon activated by rstart connections;
  - sessreg, a simple program for managing utmp/wtmp entries;
  - showfont, a font dumper for use with an X font server;
  - showrgb, a decompiler for RGB color-name databases;
  - xfsinfo, an X font server information utility;
  - xmkmf, a tool that creates a Makefile from an Imakefile; and
  - xon, a tool that starts an X program on a remote machine.
 .
 Installation of an rsh or ssh daemon (server) is necessary if rstartd is
 to be used, and installation of an rsh or ssh client is necessary if
 rstart is to be used.  The luit program requires locale information from
 the xlibs-data package.
 .
 imake uses the C preprocessor (cpp) as a macro processor.  The GNU C
 preprocessor's "-traditional" support misbehaves in early releases of the GCC
 3.3 series; therefore, this package conflicts with those versions.

Description: A Gnuplot-like tool for plotting data sets in 2D or 3D
 KMatplot is a gnuplot-like tool for plotting data sets in either two or

 multiple objects on a single page.
 .
 As opposite to Gnuplot, KMatplot is very clickable, so easier to use
 for unexperienced users. It can be used instead of Gnuplot with Octave
 and Scilab - there are new dll functions installed in those packages,
 which communicate with KMatplot through an Unix socket. Those functions
 are named 'kplot', 'kimage', kmesh', ... and are similar to those found

Description: various JACK tools: plumbing, play, udp, ctl, scope, clock
 This collection contains a bunch of small tools for JACK written by Rohan
 Drape for the JACK low latency audio API.
 .
 JACK allows the connection of multiple applications to an audio device,
 as well as allowing them to share audio between themselves.
 .
 jack.plumbing maintains a set of port connection rules and
 manages these as clients register ports with JACK. Port names are
 implicitly bounded regular expressions and support sub-expression
 patterns.
 .
 jack.play is a light-weight JACK sound file player. It
 creates as many output ports as there are channels in the input file.
 .
 jack.udp is a UDP audio transport mechansim for JACK.  The
 send mode reads signals from a set of JACK input ports and sends
 UDP packets to the indicated port at the indicated host at a rate
 determined by the local JACK daemon.  The "recv" mode reads
 incoming packets at the indicated port and writes the incoming data to
 a set of JACK output ports at a rate that is determined by the local
 JACK daemon.
 .
 jack.ctl is a JACK session manager.  It reads configuration information
 from a system wide and a user specific configuration file and
 manages sessions involving the JACK daemon proper and optionally a
 set of secondary jack daemons.
 .
 jack.scope draws either a time domain signal trace or a self
 correlation trace.  Multiple input channels are superimposed, each
 channel is drawn in a different color. jack.scope accepts
 OSC packets for interactive control of drawing parameters.
 .
 jack.clock publishes the transport state of the local JACK server as OSC
 packets over a UDP connection. jack.clock allows any OSC enabled
 application to act as a JACK transport client, receiving
 sample accurate pulse stream timing data, and monitoring and
 initiating transport state change.
 .

    doesn't support SSL
 .
  * Synchronize your mail using a completely safe and fault-tolerant
    algorithm.  (At least I think it is!)
 .
  * Customize which mailboxes to synchronize with regular expressions
    or lists.
 .
  * Synchronize your mail two to four times faster than with other tools
    or other mail readers' internal IMAP support.
 .
 In short, OfflineIMAP is a tool to let you read mail how YOU want to.

Description: Next generation, scalable, extendable web server
 Apache v2 is the next generation of the omnipresent Apache web server. This
 version - a total rewrite - introduces many new improvements, such as
 threading, a new API, IPv6 support, request/response filtering, and more.
 .
 It is also considerably faster, and can be easily extended to provide services
 other than http.
 .
 This package contains all the standard apache2 modules, including SSL support.
 However, it does *not* include the server itself; for this you need to
 install one of the apache2-mpm-* packages; such as worker or prefork.

Description: Development files for the GNOME XML library
 XML is a metalanguage to let you design your own markup language.
 A regular markup language defines a way to describe information in
 a certain class of documents (eg HTML). XML lets you define your
 own customized markup languages for many classes of document. It
 can do this because it's written in SGML, the international standard
 metalanguage for markup languages.
 .
 Install this package if you wish to develop your own programs using
 the GNOME XML library.

Description: PNG module for ClanLib game SDK
 ClanLib delivers a platform independent interface to write games with.
 If a game is written with ClanLib, it should be possible to compile the
 game under any platform (supported by ClanLib, that is) without changing
 the application source code.
 .
 But ClanLib is not just a wrapper library, providing a common interface
 to low-level libraries such as DirectFB, DirectX, OpenGL, X11, etc. While
 platform independence is ClanLib's primary goal, it also tries to be a
 service-minded game SDK. In other words, we have put great effort into
 designing the API, to ensure ClanLib's ease of use - while maintaining its
 power.
 .
 This package contains the PNG module (clanPNG).

 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this
 package.  Moreover this package is not required for building Debian
 packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

 The problem is you have no weapon to kill them.  All you can do is
 run away, dig holes in the floor to trap them or lure them into some
 area where they cannot hurt you.  After a short time a trapped enemy
 climbs out of his hole, but if it closes before that, he will die and
 reappear somewhere else.

Description: Reports bugs in the Debian distribution
 reportbug is a tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian
 and derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:
 .
  * Integration with the mutt, af, and mh/nmh mail readers.
  * Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
    whether problems have already been reported.
  * Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
  * Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
  * Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
  * Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.
 .
 reportbug is designed to be used on systems with an installed mail
 transport agent, like exim or sendmail; however, you can edit the
 configuration file and send reports using any available mail server.
 .
 If your system's users use locales with character sets other than
 UTF-8 and ISO-8859-*, one of either python2.3-cjkcodecs or
 python2.3-iconvcodec is required for proper operation.  For Asian
 locales, the use of python2.3-cjkcodecs is preferred over the more
 limited python2.3-iconvcodec.

Description: a cron-like program that doesn't go by time
 Anacron (like `anac(h)ronistic') is a periodic command scheduler.  It
 executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it
 does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine-uptime permits.
 .
 This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the Debian
 system. You should install this program if your system isn't powered on
 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other Debian packages
 are executed each day.

Version: 1.08-9
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.3.1-1)
Description: A MIX emulator and MIXAL interpreter
 Mixal is an implementation of the imaginary computer called
 MIX and its assembly language MIXAL, which were invented
 by Donald E. Knuth in the 1960's for use in his monumental
 and yet unfinished book series "The Art of Computer Programming".
 All actual programs and all programming exercises in the series
 are written in MIXAL.
 .
 This package contains a modified version of Darius Bacon's Mixal
 implementation.  It takes a MIXAL source file, translates it to
 MIX machine code and then executes the resulting program, all in
 a single run.  The result of the assembler step cannot be extracted
 to a file.  Similarly, one cannot take a precompiled MIX program and
 try to execute it in this emulator - only MIXAL source is accepted.
 .
 The MIX emulator does not support floating-point operations
 nor the tape devices described in Knuth's book.  This is not fatal,
 however, and most of the programs and exercise answers in Knuth's
 book can be run in this MIXAL implementation.

Description: binary for SlicKer, an alternative for the KDE Kicker
 Slicker consists of three primary items Cards, the Slider, and a
 Task-bar. Which can be used in conjunction with each other, and Kicker,
 or utilized by themselves.
 .
 Cards provide a frame work for embedded applets to be docked at the edge
 of the screen. These cards are "stackable" and provide a
 "retractable/extendable" work area.
 .
 The Slider is a corner piece to slicker, it provides a constant, "solid"
 launching pad, and is home of the miniapps.
 .
 The Task-bar is a typical taskbar with not so typical features... The
 taskbar is an "organic" app that cleanly expands or contracts as needed.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diff package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.

 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: Automatic screensaver for X
 The purpose of xscreensaver is to display pretty pictures on your screen
 when it is not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that unattended
 monitors should always be doing something interesting, just like they do
 in the movies.
 .
 The benefit that this program has over the combination of the xlock and
 xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphics hacks can be
 installed: you don't need to recompile this program to add a new display
 mode, you just change some resource settings.  Any program which can be
 invoked in such a way that it draws on the root window of the screen can
 now be used as a screensaver without modification.  The programs that
 are being run as screensavers don't need to have any special knowledge
 about what it means to be a screensaver.

 aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer of your sound
 card. It runs in text mode using the ncurses library, or from the command
 line (non-interactively). It can read default settings from a file, and it
 can also automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown and
 boot.
 .
 A wrapper script xaumix is provided that finds and invokes xterm or a
 replacement. This is primarily for creating the best sized terminal window.
 If you want a true graphical interface, install aumix-gtk instead. That has
 the same functionality as this one in addition to offering a nice X GUI.

 The old companion package aumix-alsa, which did take advantage of the
 extra facilities in the ALSA sound driver, is no longer available.
 This package should work fine with the OSS compatibility layer of the
 modern ALSA drivers.

 ClanLib delivers a platform independent interface to write games with.
 If a game is written with ClanLib, it should be possible to compile the

 the application source code.
 .
 But ClanLib is not just a wrapper library, providing a common interface
 to low-level libraries such as DirectFB, DirectX, OpenGL, X11, etc. While
 platform independence is ClanLib's primary goal, it also tries to be a
 service-minded game SDK. In other words, we have put great effort into
 designing the API, to ensure ClanLib's ease of use - while maintaining its
 power.

 Four wins is a game for two players. Each player is represented by a

 diagonal. This is done by placing one of your pieces into any of the
 seven columns. A piece will begin to fill a column from the bottom,
 i.e. it will fall down until it reaches the ground level or another
 stone. After a move is done it is the turn of the other player. This
 is repeated until the game is over, i.e. one of the players has four
 pieces in a row, column or diagonal or no more moves are possible
 because the board is filled.

Description: Sokoban game for KDE
 The first sokoban game was created in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi at
 the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. "Sokoban" is japanese for
 "warehouse keeper". The idea is that you are a warehouse keeper
 trying to push crates to their proper locations in a warehouse.
 .
 The problem is that you cannot pull the crates or step over them. If
 you are not careful, some of the crates can get stuck in wrong places
 and/or block your way.
 .
 It can be rather difficult just to solve a level. But if you want to
 make it even harder, you can try to minimise the number of moves
 and/or pushes you use to solve the level.
 .
 To make the game more fun for small kids (below 10 years or so), some
 collections with easier levels are also included in KSokoban. These
 are marked (easy) in the level collection menu. Of course, these
 levels can be fun for adults too, for example if you don't want to
 expose yourself to too much mental strain.

 is done based on a set of pre-configured maps.
 .
 The kernel automounter implements an almost complete SunOS style
 automounter under Linux. The automounter is supported by Linux
 kernels 2.0.31 and higher. Automounter support must be activated
 while compiling the kernel.
 .
 nfs-common is needed for NFS mounts. Perl is needed for support scripts
 for LDAP master maps.

 Kerberos which was legally exported from the US by removing all encryption
 hooks before export. It isn't covered by any patents and should be legal to
 use anywhere encryption is legal at all.

Description: Debian archive proxy and partial mirror builder development
 This is version 2 of apt-proxy which will, when ready, replace apt-proxy v1.
 .
 apt-proxy automatically builds a Debian HTTP mirror based
 on requests which pass through the proxy.  It's great for
 multiple Debian machines on the same network with a slower
 internet link.
 .
 The archive is automatically kept up to date using http,
 ftp or rsync.  Cache cleaning of unused and old versions
 is configurable.  You can also import the contents of
 your apt cache into the archive using apt-proxy-import.
 .
 For more information, see the apt-proxy homepage at
 http://apt-proxy.sourceforge.net
 .
 The suggested packages are needed for the following
 features: rsync for rsyncd backends, and
 dpkg-dev for apt-proxy-import.

Description: Link two X displays together, simulating a multiheaded display
 x2x joins a pair of X displays together, as if they were a single
 multiheaded display.  The pointer can be warped between displays,
 or, depending on how you start x2x, can slide from one display to the
 other when it runs off the edge of the screen.  Keyboard focus also
 moves between displays in the way you'd expect, and the X selection
 propagates around.  At least one of the displays involved (specifically,
 the one being controlled remotely) must support the XTEST extension.
 (The servers shipped by Debian support this.)
 .
 x2x is useful when you have two displays on the same desk, as you can use
 a single keyboard and mouse to control both.  If you want to propagate
 your selections between displays which are not sharing a desk, you might
 be more interested in the package propsel.  Propsel does not link the
 displays' keyboard and mouse, which would be confusing in some cases,
 and can propagate between up to 8 displays, whereas x2x can handle only
 two at a time.

Description: A utility for building Linux kernel related Debian packages.
 This package provides the capability to create a debian kernel-image
 package by just running make-kpkg kernel_image in a kernel source
 directory tree.  It can also package the relevant kernel headers into
 a kernel-headers package. In general, this package is very useful if
 you need to create a custom kernel, if, for example, the default
 kernel does not support some of your hardware, or you wish a leaner,
 meaner kernel.  It also scripts the steps that need be taken to
 compile the kernel, which is quite convenient (forgetting a crucial
 step once was the initial motivation for this package). Please look at
 /usr/share/doc/kernel-package/Rationale.gz for a full list of advantages
 of this package.
 .
 If you are running on an intel x86 platform, and you wish to compile a
 custom kernel (why else are you considering this package?), then you may
 need the package bin86 as well.  (This is not required on other platforms).

Description: management of regular background processing
 cron is a background process (`daemon') that runs programs at regular
 intervals (for example, every minute, day, week or month); which
 processes are run and at what times are specified in the `crontab'.
 .
 Users may also install crontabs so that processes are run on
 their behalf, though this feature can be disabled or restricted to
 particular users.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do various standard
 system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not
 grow endlessly and overflow the disk.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recommends", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

Description: unit-testing framework for the Ruby language
 This allows you to easily and flexibly write testing code for your
 Ruby classes and modules. The general idea behind unit testing is that
 you write a test method that makes certain assertions about your code,
 working against a test fixture. A bunch of these test methods are
 bundled up into a test suite and can be run any time the developer
 wants. The results of a run are gathered in a test result and displayed
 to the user through some UI. Test::Unit also has a compatibility layer
 for RubyUnit, the old unit testing framework for Ruby.
 .
 Because the Ruby/GTK package in Debian does not support Ruby 1.8, the
 GTK test runner is disabled for this package. The Fox test runner is also
 unavailable because Ruby's Fox module has not been packaged for Debian.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Ruby version (currently 1.8.x).

 does a much better job of suggesting possible spellings than just about
 any other spell-checker available for the English language, including
 Ispell and Microsoft Word.  It also has many other technical
 enhancements over Ispell such as using shared memory for dictionaries
 and intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one
 Aspell process is open at once.
 .
 Aspell is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Ispell.

Description: Dictionary Client
 dict is the client that queries the dictd server.  Since it is TCP
 based, it can access servers on the local host, on a local network,
 or on the Internet.
 .
 The DICT Development Group maintains several public servers which can
 be accessed from any machine connected to the Internet.  The default
 configuration is to query one of these servers first, but this may be
 changed in the configuration file /etc/dict.conf.
 .
 Queries may be customized by numerous command line options, including
 specifying the database(s) to be queried and the search strategy to
 be used.
 .
 dict includes dictl, which simplifies using utf-8 encoded dictionaries
 with terminals that do not support utf-8.

Description: A memory debugger for x86-linux
 Valgrind is a GPL'd tool to help you find memory-management problems in your
 programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads and
 writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
 intercepted.
 .
 Valgrind can debug more or less any dynamically-linked ELF Linux x86
 executable, without modification, recompilation, or anything, as long as it
 contains only classic x86 code (MMX/SSE/SSE2/3DNow! largely unsupported for
 the moment). There is experimental support for programs using libpthread.
 .
 Valgrind provides a generic infrastructure for supervising the execution of
 programs called "tools". This is done by providing a way to instrument

Description: PPP dialer with built-in intelligence
 WvDial sacrifices some of the flexibility of programs like "chat" in order
 to make your dialup configuration easier.  When you install this package,
 your modem will be detected automatically and you need to specify just
 three parameters: the phone number, username, and password.  WvDial knows
 enough to dial with most modems and log in to most servers without any
 other help.
 .
 In particular, you no longer need a "chat script" to handle the most common
 situations.

 wddx, xml, yp and zlib.
 .
 PHP4 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
 from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown
 in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write
 dynamically generated pages quickly.
 .
 The most significant change between php3 and php4 is the new parser engine
 called Zend, which boosts performance quite impressively.

Description: linuxprinting.org printer support - database
 Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up
 common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems).
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 your actual printer, by telling your computer how to process files
 sent to the printer.
 .
 This package contains the printer database distributed by
 linuxprinting.org for most common drivers.  You will probably need
 the foomatic-db-engine package for this package to be useful.
 .
 The foomatic-db-hpijs package adds additional printers supported by
 the HPIJS printer driver backend, particularly consumer inkjet
 printers from Hewlett-Packard.
 .
 The foomatic-db-gimp-print package adds additional printers supported
 by the GIMP-Print printer driver backend, most commonly used for
 color photo printing on consumer inkjets.
 .
 The foo2zjs package adds backend support for a number of printers
 from HP and Minolta/QMS that use the Zenographics ZjStream protocol.

 porting and to alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet
 capture modules in each application.

 Xdelta is an application program designed to compute changes between
 files.  These changes (deltas) are similar to the output of the
 "diff" program in that they may be used to store and transmit only the
 changes between files.  However, unlike diff, the output of Xdelta is
 not expressed in a human-readable format--Xdelta can also apply
 these deltas to a copy of the original file.  Xdelta uses a fast,
 linear algorithm and performs well on both binary and text files.

 Ghostscript is used for PostScript preview and printing.  Usually as
 a back-end to a program such as ghostview, it can display postscript
 documents in an X11 environment.
 .
 Furthermore, it can render PostScript files as graphics to be printed
 on non-PostScript printers.  Supported printers include common
 dot-matrix, inkjet and laser models.
 .
 Package gsfonts contains a set of standard fonts for Ghostscript.
 .
 This version of gs is a fork of GNU Ghostscript with updated drivers
 and patches, intended mostly for use with the Common UNIX Printing
 System (CUPS) from Easy Software Products (www.easysw.com).  The
 ESP Ghostscript homepage is available at:

Description: interactive geometry program for KDE
 Kig is an application for interactive geometry.  It is intended to serve
 two purposes:
 .
  - to allow students to interactively explore mathematical figures and
    concepts using the computer;
  - to serve as a WYSIWYG tool for drawing mathematical figures and
    including them in other documents.
 .
 With this program you can do geometry on a computer just like you would
 on a blackboard in a classroom.  However, the program allows you to move
 and change parts of a geometrical drawing so that you can see how the other
 parts change as a result.
 .
 Kig supports loci and user-defined macros.  It also supports imports
 and exports to/from foreign file formats including KGeo, KSeg and XFig.
 .
 This package is part of the official KDE edutainment module.

Description: GNOME HTTP client library - run-time kit
 The HTTP protocol is the protocol that is the underlying transport
 mechanism for the modern world wide web.  The protocol is well
 documented and widely implemented.  While the use of the protocol is
 generally associated with the web, its uses can be extended to many
 other areas where a stateless, transactional protocol may be
 appropriate.
 .
 The GNOME HTTP library is designed to be simple and easy to use while
 still allowing one to get one's feet wet at the protocol layer if
 needed.  It is also designed with graphical, non-threaded
 applications in mind.  One should be able to use the library in an
 application and never block waiting to send or receive data to a
 remote server.  The main thread of execution should always be
 available to refresh its display.
 .
 This library is fully compliant with HTTP 1.1 as defined in the draft
 5 update of RFC 2068.
 .
 This package contains the run-time kit consisting of the shared
 version of the library.

Description: Debian Font Manager -- automatic font configuration framework
 Defoma, which stands for DEbian FOnt MAnager, provides a framework
 for automatic font configuration. An application whose configuration
 of fonts usually requires manual intervention can automate the
 process through Defoma, by installing a Defoma-configuration
 script. The script gets called whenever a font is installed and
 removed, so that the script may update the application configuration.
 .
 Font packages should register their fonts to Defoma in order to have them
 configured automatically for applications.

 support for doing hardware detection at boot time.  Detection occurs in two
 stages: The first stage, which runs from an initial ramdisk (initrd), loads
 just the drivers needed to mount the root file system, and the second stage
 loads the rest (ethernet cards, sound cards, etc.).

Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.
 .
 The main features in libmpeg2 are:
 .
  * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to
    certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2
    is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty
    extensive test suite to check this.
 .
  * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the
    fastest library around for what it does.
 .
  * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific
    optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back
    on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least we have heard
    reports from people running this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.
 .
  * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific
    code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very
    diverse projects.
 .
 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

 strace is a system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out

 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: The Linux Kernel Device Mapper userspace library
 The Linux Kernel Device Mapper is the LVM (Linux Logical Volume Management)
 Team's implementation of a minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles
 volume management, while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout
 in user-space.  This makes it useful for not only LVM, but EVMS, software
 raid, and other drivers that create "virtual" block devices.
 .
 This package contains the (user-space) shared library for accessing the
 device-mapper; it allows usage of the device-mapper through a clean,
 consistent interface (as opposed to through kernel ioctls).

 Less is a program similar to more(1), but which allows backward
 movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not
 have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input
 files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).  Less uses
 termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of
 terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.

 xfs is a daemon that listens on a network port and serves X fonts to X
 servers (and thus to X clients).  All X servers have the ability to serve
 locally installed fonts for themselves, but xfs makes it possible to offload
 that job from the X server, and/or have a central repository of fonts on a
 networked machine running xfs so that all the machines running X servers on a
 network do not require their own set of fonts.  xfs may also be invoked by
 users to, for instance, make available X fonts in user accounts that are not
 available to the X server or to an already running system xfs.

 The aim of the library is *not* to replace any available PGP version.
 There will be no real support for key management (sign, revoke, alter
 preferences, ...) and some other parts are only rudimentarily
 available. The main purpose is to handle and understand OpenPGP
 packets and to execute basic operations on them. For example to
 encrypt/decrypt or to sign/verify keys and some packet routines.
 .
 Because of the fact that sensitive data is being handled, the
 library doesn't contain any real cryptographic code. The libgcrypt
 package is used for all crypto routines.

 ClanLib delivers a platform independent interface to write games with.
 If a game is written with ClanLib, it should be possible to compile the
 game under any platform (supported by ClanLib, that is) without changing
 the application source code.
 .
 But ClanLib is not just a wrapper library, providing a common interface
 to low-level libraries such as DirectFB, DirectX, OpenGL, X11, etc. While
 platform independence is ClanLib's primary goal, it also tries to be a
 service-minded game SDK. In other words, we have put great effort into
 designing the API, to ensure ClanLib's ease of use - while maintaining its
 power.
 .
 This package contains the Vorbis module (clanVorbis).

Description: a syntax and minimal style checker for HTML
 This is perl script which picks fluff off html pages, much in the same
 way traditional lint picks fluff off C programs.
 .
 The script is pretty much a a wrapper around the Weblint module.  It
 currently supports HTML 4.0 (and only HTML 4.0).  It allows the various
 syntax and stylistic checks to be enabled or disabled by the user or in
 a system-wide configuration file.
 .
 NOTE: This is a beta release of Weblint 2.0 that provides a subset of
 of the final functionality.  There are one or two features from 1.020
 that aren't currently available.  But this implements just about all
 the warnings from 1.020 and uses current HTML standards.

Description: Emulate IO::File interface for in-core strings
 The IO::String module provide the IO::File interface for in-core
 strings.  An IO::String object can be attached to a string, and
 will make it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or
 writing data, as well as seeking to various locations of the string.
 The main reason you might want to do this, is if you have some other
 library module that only provide an interface to file handles, and you
 want to keep all the stuff in memory.
 .
 The IO::String module provide an interface compatible with
 IO::File as distributed with IO-1.20, but the following methods
 are not available; new_from_fd, fdopen, format_write,
 format_page_number, format_lines_per_page, format_lines_left,
 format_name, format_top_name.
