protobuf (2.0.3-2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fix FTBFS from -2.1: don't fail when we can't clean up the java build,
    such as when openjdk isn't installed.
  * Disable parallel builds, because libtool is made of fail (if binary-arch
    and build-indep run concurrently, we relink a library while it's being
    used; that doesn't work so well).

protobuf (2.0.3-2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Medium urgency for RC bugfix.
  * Fix building of test suites on ia64: use __clone2() instead of clone(),

  * Only build the java and python bindings when building the arch:all
    packages.  Move openjdk to Build-Depends-Indep.  This should allow
    building on hppa, which doesn't have openjdk.  Based on a patch by Sune
    Vuorela (but any bugs are mine).
