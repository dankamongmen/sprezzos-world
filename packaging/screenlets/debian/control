Description: Widget-like mini-applications for GNOME
 Screenlets are small owner-drawn applications (written in Python) that can be
 described as "the virtual representation of things lying/standing around on
 your desk". Sticky notes, clocks, rulers, ... the possibilities are endless.
 .
 The goal of the Screenlets base-classes is to simplify the creation of fully
 themable mini-apps that each solve basic desktop-work-related needs and
 generally improve the usability and eye-candy of the modern composited
 Linux-desktop. 
 .
 Features:
  * Real applications, no HTML-"widgets"
  * Easy to use, easy to develop
  * Full compositing support
  * Works with any composited X desktop (compiz, xfce4, ...)
  * Works also on non-composited desktop
  * Included ability to apply themes (SVG, PNG or mixed)
  * Fully scalable when using SVGs
  * Embedded drag&drop-support
  * Automated storing of options (using ini or GConf)
  * Controllable through customizable D-Bus service
  * Can be used together with compiz' widget-plugin to create a 
    Dashboard-like feature as seen on OS X
  * Uses Cairo and GTK2 for drawing and windowing
