                     Changelog for the Advanced Versions

   Experimental versions are PURPLE
   Beta test versions are RED
   Release candidates are BLUE
   Release versions are GREEN
   The advanced versions are identified from the standard version they are
   derived from. The changes which were made in the original stable
   version are not repeated here (unless they were first made in an
