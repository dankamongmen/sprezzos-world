Package: libosinfo-1.0-0
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, hwdata
Description: Library for managing information about operating systems and hypervisors
 libosinfo is a GObject based library API for managing information about
 operating systems, hypervisors and the (virtual) hardware devices they
 can support. It includes a database containing device metadata and
 provides APIs to match/identify optimal devices for deploying an
 operating system on a hypervisor.
 .
 Via the GObject Introspection, the API is available in all common
 programming languages.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
