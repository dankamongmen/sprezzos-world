groff (1.22.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (LP: #1095075).
  * Use xz compression for binary packages.
  * Use 'dh $@ --options' rather than 'dh --options $@', for
    forward-compatibility with debhelper v8.
  * Use dh-autoreconf.
  * Change Homepage from http://groff.ffii.org/ to
    https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/.  Suggested by Bernd Warken.
  * Don't compress *.mom examples.  They're not all that large, and this
    allows dropping a manual page patch against upstream.
  * Recommend perl for gropdf.

groff (1.21-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Go back to installing groff.info from the source directory, not the
    build directory; timestamps are such that make won't rebuild it (closes:
    #609459).

groff (1.21-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - New warning category 'file'.  (man-db uses this as part of
      automatically enabling language-specific hyphenation rules, which
      should now work.)
    - CJK line-breaking and hyphenation support (closes: #552201).
    - Fix typo in groff_man(7) (closes: #369254).
    - Fix typo in "Character Translations" info node (closes: #450434).
    - Fix white heart and diamond Unicode values in groff_char(7) (closes:
      #540477).
    - Point to troff(1) for -w and -W in groff(1) (closes: #545807).
  * Document reasons for groff's Recommends in its package description
    (closes: #599648).
  * Switch build-dependency from byacc to bison, as that's what was used to
    generate the parsers in the 1.21 release.
  * Force YACC='bison -y' when configuring, to avoid problems if byacc is
    also installed.
  * Use a separate build directory, eliminating the requirement to preserve
    some files by hand.
  * Policy version 3.9.1:
    - Rename debian/README.build to debian/README.source.
    - Add a Homepage field.
    - Refer to /usr/share/common-licenses/GFDL-1.3 in debian/copyright
      rather than quoting it (although the GPL v3 governs this package, as
      explained in detail in debian/copyright).
    - Use Breaks rather than Conflicts.

groff (1.20.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle ditroff command `Dt' without argument gracefully (closes:

groff (1.20.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert to source format 3.0 (quilt).
  * Add a 'quilt-setup' target to debian/rules for the benefit of those
    checking out the package from revision control.
  * All patches are now maintained separately and tagged according to DEP-3.

groff (1.20.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use /bin/bash for grap2graph due to use of $RANDOM, as for eqn2graph and
    pic2graph.
  * Fix some unnecessary bashisms in gdiffmk (closes: #547750).
  * Use 'dh_installdocs --link-doc' option from debhelper 7.4.2.
  * Use POSIX-compliant 'trap' syntax (closes: #256226; the other problems
    identified in this bug were fixed some time ago).
  * Honour /etc/papersize in DVI output.
  * Remove contrib/pdfmark/groff-pdfroff.* on clean.
  * Preserve src/preproc/eqn/eqn.cpp, src/preproc/eqn/eqn_tab.h,
    src/preproc/pic/pic.cpp, src/preproc/pic/pic_tab.h, and
    src/preproc/refer/label.cpp, and restore them after running 'make
    realclean' to avoid a large diff.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Feb 2010 23:37:25 +0000

groff (1.20.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Convert to dh(1).
  * Make /usr/share/groff/1.20.1/font/devlj4/generate/special.awk
    executable.
  * Move europs.tmac to groff-base (closes: #546844).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Sep 2009 09:51:21 +0100

groff (1.20.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to debhelper v7. (There's still lots of complexity here, so no
    dh(1).)
  * Remove Fumitoshi UKAI from Uploaders, with thanks for his previous work.
    Just shout if you want to be added back (closes: #541019).
  * Unset IFS at nroff startup (closes: #541621).
  * Patch from Openwall to fix temporary file handling vulnerabilities in
    pdfroff (closes: #538330).
  * Use -dSAFER when calling gs from pdfroff (thanks, brian m. carlson;
    closes: #538338).

groff (1.20.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move devtag.tmac and papersize.tmac to groff-base (thanks, Niko Tyni;
    closes: #537767).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Jul 2009 06:01:02 +0100

groff (1.20.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tell 'make' (as well as 'make install') about docdir, so that it gets
    substituted properly into manual pages.
  * Adjust pic(1) and pdfroff(1) references to account for compression
    (closes: #498356).
  * Backport from upstream, fixing "bad character definition" warnings:
    - tmac/doc.tmac: Call `ec' before mapping characters.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Jul 2009 10:11:43 +0100

groff (1.20.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure /usr/share/groff/current is only in groff-base, not also in
    groff (closes: #537667).
  * Bump groff-base Replaces: groff version to include 1.20.1-1, just in
    case the above bug confused some dpkg databases into believing that
    /usr/share/groff/current is owned by groff.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Jul 2009 08:26:22 +0100

groff (1.20.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #196762, #415754). See the NEWS file for
    full details of improvements, to which I can't do justice here, but
    items relevant to Debian bug reports include:
    - Unicode input support has been very much improved, including a new
      'preconv' preprocessor which converts various input encodings to
      something groff can understand directly (closes: #322760), which also
      allows us to avoid the old and rather broken ascii8 device (closes:
      #533778); support for composite glyphs; and localisation files for
      several languages.
    - mdoc .Dt now allows overriding the volume name (closes: #176575).
    - Backquote formatting fixed in groff(1) (closes: #184603).
    - HTML output much improved, including a DOCTYPE (closes: #190209).
    - \[an] is now U+23AF, not U+2500 (closes: #382265).
    - rs/rq typo fixed in groff(7) (closes: #402854).
    - pic now supports up to 32 macro arguments, and ignores further
      arguments rather than crashing (closes: #453260).
  * Dropped multibyte patch. CJK is partially supported by way of Unicode
    input, but widths are wrong and proper line breaking is not implemented;
    this is planned to be added by way of "character classes". However, I
    can't justify holding new groff code out of Debian any longer when CJK
    manual pages can more or less be read with the new release.
  * Since the M and G fonts no longer exist:
    - \f5 and \f6 no longer break (closes: #227091);
    - We no longer get spurious devdvi font errors (closes: #194041);
    - We no longer fail to italicise or underline CJK text (closes:
      #288382).
    - Angle brackets around URLs no longer have broken widths (closes:
      #522323).
  * Add localisation macro files to groff-base.
  * Adjust #! line of font/devlj4/generate/special.awk; awk is in
    /usr/bin/awk on Debian, not /bin/awk.
  * Add preconv to groff-base.
  * Imported into a branch on bzr.debian.org; add Vcs-Bzr control field.

groff (1.18.1.1-22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix bug number for groffer fix in previous changelog entry.
  * If the ascii8 device is used, pass through the input encoding even if
    LC_CTYPE=C (closes: #519367).
  * Build-depend on and recommend ghostscript rather than the obsolete
    package gs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Mar 2009 10:48:01 +0000

groff (1.18.1.1-21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on xutils-dev rather than xutils (thanks, Daniel Schepler;
    closes: #485203).
  * Update DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS parsing code from policy 3.8.0.
  * Build-depend on x11proto-core-dev rather than x-dev (thanks, Lintian).
  * Use /bin/bash for eqn2graph and pic2graph due to use of $RANDOM, even
    though that's only a fallback in case mktemp fails (closes: #489604).
  * Display more helpful output if a device was not found but is known to be
    one of the devices in the groff binary package rather than groff-base.
  * Define .PS and .PE to empty strings in pic output to inhibit -wmac
    warnings (closes: #495713); similarly, define .EQ and .EN to empty
    strings in eqn output.
  * Add information to debian/copyright (a file from newer groff releases
    and a clarifying e-mail) noting that upstream has relicensed the groff
    documentation under the terms of the GPL (closes: #374569).
  * Remove some fallback constructs from groffer that aren't necessary with
    POSIX shells and that break dash (closes: #454902).

groff (1.18.1.1-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport from upstream:
    - Add an-ext.tmac, containing extension macros for -man such as UR/UE
      and MT/ME; load it from an-old.tmac. This file is under a very liberal
      licence, and manual page authors should copy any macros they use from
      it to the preamble of their manual pages in order to ensure
      portability to older groff and other manual page viewers (closes:
      #470469).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Mar 2008 12:29:03 +0000

groff (1.18.1.1-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport from upstream:
    - Make the mdoc .In macro parsed and callable. If not in the synopsis,
      represent the C header file enclosed in angle brackets (closes:

groff (1.18.1.1-15) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Forest Bond ]
  * debian/groff-base.mime: Use the utf8 device by default, as most modern
    systems use UTF-8 by default nowadays (LP: #174297).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Make nroff wrapper accept -w and -W options and pass them to groff to
    enable and disable warnings.

  * Add (untested) support for the BIG5-HKSCS encoding used by zh_HK.
  * Backport from upstream:
    - src/devices/grolbp/lbp.cc: Don't define _GNU_SOURCE (closes: #441534).
  * Make groff binary-NMU-safe by using ${binary:Version} rather than
    ${Source-Version}.
  * Don't ignore 'make realclean' or 'make extraclean' errors other than
    missing Makefiles.

groff (1.18.1.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on x-dev, libx11-dev, libxmu-dev, and libxt-dev rather than
    the transitional xlibs-dev package.
  * Use debhelper v4.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Dec 2005 13:28:09 +0000

groff (1.18.1.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Configure gxditview with 'xmkmf -DBuildXaw=NO' to override imake's
    incorrect ideas about library linkage and avoid libXp when linking with
    libXaw7. We don't need Xprint support anyway.
  * Build-depend on just libxaw7-dev, dropping the alternative.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Sep 2005 10:38:10 +0100

groff (1.18.1.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move www.tmac to groff-base (closes: #319506).
  * Fix non-XSI code in groff.postinst (part of #256226).
  * Improve CJK support (closes: #324107):
    - Add support for Chinese GB2312/GBK and BIG5 encodings (in the
      increasingly-misnamed nippon driver), with kinsoku tables borrowed
      from Emacs. Simon Law eyeballed the GB2312/GBK table.
    - Expect UTF-8 input when running under a ko_*.UTF-8 locale. Functional
      Korean support still requires a kinsoku table and a groff font
      covering Hangul.
  * Fix use of DoCharacter() in multibyte case; some calls to it were
    missing the fourth argument (closes: #285524).
  * Policy version 3.6.2. No changes required.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Aug 2005 12:54:37 +0100

groff (1.18.1.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

groff (1.18.1.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Too many fonts are missing the Unicode HYPHEN character, so I give up.
    Render "-" as HYPHEN-MINUS (ASCII 0x2D) by default. (Of course, manual
    pages using "-" when they should be using "\-" should still be fixed.)

groff (1.18.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clarify copyright file (closes: #279904). Some items of documentation
    are under non-free licences; this is exempt for sarge, and in any case
    will be resolved when I update to a new version of groff after sarge.

groff (1.18.1-15) unstable; urgency=low

    Karttunen; closes: #216819). How did I miss this when doing the same for

groff (1.18.1-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add sample code to /etc/groff/man.local and /etc/groff/mdoc.local to
    make "-" render as Unicode HYPHEN-MINUS on the utf8 device. This is
    commented out by default because man pages which require this are buggy:
    "\-" should be used instead when a real dash as opposed to a logical
    hyphen is required.
  * Fix some typos in groff(1) (thanks, Göran Weinholt; closes: #181375).

groff (1.18.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Never recode input or output for the ascii8 device. It doesn't work in
    non-trivial locales, since ascii8 isn't supposed to be prepared for
    input in, say, UTF-8, and the point of ascii8 is to be a trivial hack
    device for use when you know your input encoding is the same as your
    output encoding. This makes man(1)'s life easier, and incidentally fixes
    a problem with iconv replacing certain Polish characters with question
    marks (closes: #170320).
  * Revert part of the original attempt at fixing #170320 (in 1.18.1-2),
    which made ascii8 accept U+0100 to U+0200. This is no longer necessary
    with the above, and it broke the assumptions in
    font::get_font_wchar_metric(), causing problems for KOI8-R input.
  * Stop output devices breaking when given the 'x init' command in an
    intermediate output file rather than 'x init <encoding>'.

groff (1.18.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure that the default input character encoding is always
    ISO-8859-1, except for the ascii8 device and for Japanese locales. This
    is required for compatibility with upstream.
  * Automatically load latin1.tmac when using all terminal devices except
    ascii, not just the latin1 device.

groff (1.18.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use groff's font metric instead of wcwidth()
    (src/devices/grotty/tty.cc): add cols to tty_font
  	add_char takes font parameter
  	tty_printer:add_char calculate hpos by using font metric
    (src/include/encoing.h src/libs/libgroff/encoding.cc): 
  	put_wchar returns number of bytes written, not columns.
  * font metric fixed, X*/M.proto, 
  * fix sed script in font's Makefile.sub. sed doesn't see + as regex metachar.
    replace [0-9]+ to [0-9][0-9]*.

groff (1.18.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use wcwidth() to find the width of UTF-8 characters. This seems to work
    well for both en_GB.UTF-8 and ja_JP.UTF-8, so both CJK and non-CJK
    output should finally be correct (closes: #173764).
  * Recommend libpaper1 instead of libpaperg.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Feb 2003 19:33:50 +0000

groff (1.18.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * put_wchar() returns number of columns for char

groff (1.18.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recode this changelog to UTF-8.
  * Clarify README.Debian to mention the error message you get if you've
    forgotten to install groff as well as groff-base (see #175585).
  * Build with g++ 3.2. Drop hppa -fno-strength-reduce hack from 1.17.2-12,
    which I hope should no longer be required.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed,  8 Jan 2003 03:26:13 +0000

groff (1.18.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport upstream patch to fix segfaults in
    node::add_discretionary_hyphen() observed while building aegis and
    aegis3 (closes: #173058, #173063).
  * Fix pic2graph syntax error, thanks to lintian. Patch also sent upstream.
  * Patch from Fumitoshi UKAI to fix ISO-8859-2 output through devascii8
    (closes: #170320).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Dec 2002 14:59:20 +0000

groff (1.18.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Includes 'Am' string in mdoc from NetBSD (closes: #163195).
  * Amend debian/copyright to reflect that the papersize fallback patch has
    been merged upstream.
  * Actually call the GROFF_LANGINFO_CODESET macro as well as defining it.

  * New multibyte patch from Fumitoshi UKAI, with adjustments by me. Fixes
    Japanese HTML output, among other things (closes: #149006).

    groff (1.18.1-0.u1) unstable; urgency=low

groff (1.18-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Policy version 3.5.7:
    - Drop DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=debug support; compile with -g by default.
    - Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt.
  * src/roff/troff/node.cc (bracket_node::copy): Fix a segfault on copying
    an empty bracket_node, such as '(\bu' (closes: #162595).

groff (1.18-6) unstable; urgency=low

    macro definition was missing a backslash (closes: #160713).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Sep 2002 00:54:39 +0100

groff (1.18-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Document the Debian groff macro path in README.Debian.
  * Map \- to Unicode HYPHEN-MINUS in UTF-8 mode, for more convenient
    searching in man pages (closes: #159872).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Sep 2002 22:34:21 +0100

groff (1.18-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream patch to freeze unbreakable spaces, preventing a failed
    assertion on latin1(7) (closes: #155969).
  * Install text versions of meintro.ps, meref.ps, and pic.ps. Other
    documents either aren't very useful in plain text or don't format well
    (closes: #155226).
  * Reorder clean target a little.

groff (1.18-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/devices/grohtml/html-table.cc: Initialize another variable properly.
    This really fixes the segfault during the arm build.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Jul 2002 02:52:20 +0100

groff (1.18-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/include/encoding.h: Fix broken token-after-#endif syntax.
  * src/devices/grohtml/post-html.cc: Make sure pointsize is initialized
    properly. This fixes an infinite loop in the ia64 build, and perhaps arm
    too.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Jul 2002 18:41:46 +0100

groff (1.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Highlights:
    - Colour support (although see below).
    - New macro set, mom, mainly for non-scientific writers. The aim of
      these macros is to make groff accessible for ordinary use with a
      minimum of convoluted syntax.
    - 'eu' and 'Eu' characters available for Euro support.
    - Improved support for TeX hyphenation files.
    - New means of setting the line length, which now works for -mdoc manual
      pages as well as -man. Use man-db >= 2.4.0 to take advantage of this.
    - Documentation of the differences between groff and Unix troff is now
      in groff_diff(7).
    - groff_mwww(1) has been renamed to groff_www(1).
    - groff_ms(7) has been completely rewritten.
    - New scripts: groffer, pic2graph, and eqn2graph.
    - Substantial improvements in grohtml (although it's still alpha),
      including dealing with overstriking properly (closes: #67545).

  * Many thanks, again, to Fumitoshi UKAI for forward-porting the Japanese
    patch.
  * Disable the new ANSI colour/bold/underline escapes in nroff mode,
    because most pagers either fail to cope with it or need special options
    to do so. It can be re-enabled by editing /etc/groff/man.local and
    /etc/groff/mdoc.local, or by setting the environment variable GROFF_SGR
    to something non-empty.
  * Drop most current /etc/papersize patches, as the 'papersize' DESC
    keyword is now available upstream. We now only patch the DESC files and
    extend the papersize keyword to allow falling back to something else if
    /etc/papersize doesn't exist.
  * Fix the removal of final newlines when reading /etc/papersize.
  * Translate the 'oq' character to an apostrophe (0x27) rather than a
    backquote (0x60) when using devices other than utf8 (closes: #149086).

  * Merge groff-x11 back into groff, since this release doesn't have to
    worry so much about smooth upgrades from potato (closes: #129835).
  * Accordingly, remove the debconf note about this, since it was an abuse
    of debconf anyway. README.Debian describes the package organization.
  * Include more documentation in the main groff package (closes: #121475).
  * Build-depend on gs, netpbm, and psutils for HTML documentation. Mention
    in README.build that people bootstrapping a new port or otherwise
    building the base system from scratch don't need these three.
  * Recommend these three packages for the grohtml driver.
  * Recommend imagemagick for pic2graph and eqn2graph.
  * Downgrade libpaperg dependency to a recommendation, since we fall back
    to a4 now if it's not installed.
  * Use debhelper v3 mode.
  * Upstream ships pre-built info files now, so use them. You need texinfo
    (>= 4.2) if you want to regenerate them.

groff (1.17.2-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Back to unstable, now that there's no concern about disrupting woody.
    Merge changes from -15.woody.1 (unstable) and -16 (experimental).
  * Delete excess charset information in M and G font files that also use
    the fixedkanji directive, after consultation with Fumitoshi UKAI. This
    saves over 1.6Mb.
  * Move ps device to base, now that it isn't quite so large. It's needed
    there because it's the default device (closes: #131410).
  * Update the descriptions of groff-base and groff for the move of the
    PostScript device.

  * Document the build-dependency loop with xfree86, and allow people
    constructing new ports to override this temporarily with
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=no-groff-x11 (closes: #130312).
  * Import AM_LANGINFO_CODESET macro from gettext, and use it for
    --enable-japanese to provide an emulation of nl_langinfo(CODESET) for
    systems that don't have it (closes: #130356).
  * Fix build without --enable-japanese.
  * Build-depend on a version of debhelper which pulls in debconf-utils
    (closes: #130357).
  * Test that Makefile.clean doesn't exist before clobbering it in the
    configure target.

  * Of course, the library directory has moved with the new version number.
    Add a symlink, /usr/share/groff/current, which points to the current
    library directory; also add a versioned conflicts on troffcvt, which I'm
    about to fix to cope with this. If you rely on some particular version,
    use it; if not, use current.
  * Autogenerate debian/groff-base.files and debian/groff-base.links.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Jun 2001 00:54:37 +0100

groff (1.17-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Back out patch supporting transparent decompression of groff's input
    stream. Since programs using groff have to support systems where *roff
    doesn't know how to decompress things, it doesn't really simplify
    anything else greatly; more importantly, using gzip means that argument
    parsing didn't always work the way we expected (closes: #75990).
  * The lj4 and ps drivers already support /etc/papersize due to an earlier
    Debian patch, and it turns out that lbp supports it upstream but wasn't
    previously configured to use it. Altered its DESC file to meet libpaper
    standards (closes: #19681, #19722).
  * Move the error unwind for groff-base's preinst into its postrm (oops).
  * New German debconf translation (thanks, Sebastian Feltel;
    closes: #100681).
  * Add README.Debian, describing the recent package reorganization.

groff (1.17-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restore /usr/share/groff/tmac to the macro path, as some third-party

    the vgrind maintainer to check that groff 1.17 hasn't broken anything
    else).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Jun 2001 19:06:15 +0100

groff (1.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Brown paper bag bug: move grotty to groff-base!
  * Also move the doc macros to groff-base; some man pages use them. (This
    and the above bloat -base by some 200K, I'm afraid.)
  * Mention in the debconf note that groff-base supports Latin-1 and UTF-8
    as well as ASCII.
  * /usr/share/groff/site-tmac contains mdoc.local as well as man.local as
    of 1.17, so make that whole directory a symlink to /etc/groff and
    migrate the old /etc/tmac.man.local conffile to /etc/groff/man.local.
    This seems to need some ugly migration code.
  * Back out the autoconf 2.50 diffs for now, as they were polluting the
    .diff.gz. I've sent them upstream, though.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Jun 2001 17:02:12 +0100

groff (1.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (ciao, Fabrizio).
  * Thanks for the NMUs (closes: #75722, #90765).
  * New upstream release, with corresponding debian/copyright updates.
  * Follow upstream's move to versioned subdirectories of /usr/share/groff.
  * The components of groff required to support normal use of man-db are now
    in a separate package, groff-base (thanks, Elrond; closes: #53225).
  * Also split out gxditview and the devices that use it into the groff-x11
    package. I'd have preferred them to stay part of groff, as discussed on
    -devel, but the necessary xlibs dependency would mean that everybody
    dist-upgrading from a potato base system would get the X libraries.
    Added a debconf note to avoid silent loss of functionality; maybe in
    woody+1 they can be merged back into groff.

  * New packaging, using debhelper.
    - This shouldn't generate invalid syntax in the prerm (closes: #86437).
    - All binaries should be correctly stripped now (closes: #96786).
  * Add build dependencies (thanks, Daniel Schepler; closes: #80844).
  * Don't bother running configure in the clean target.
  * Touch configure in debian/rules to avoid a build-dep on autoconf. This
    means I have to remember to run the autotools manually every time. Ugh.
  * Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS debug and nostrip.
  * Mark /etc/X11/app-defaults/GXditview as a conffile.
  * All this brings us to Standards-Version: 3.5.2.

  * New Japanese patch (version 0.0.2) from Fumitoshi UKAI. This may not be
    quite right yet; please let me know if there are any problems.
  * Replace mdate.sh with something whose results are more predictable
    (thanks, Florian Lohoff; closes: #62554).
  * Force LC_ALL to C so that makeinfo doesn't insert some localized strings
    for the package builder's environment (closes: #84370).
  * s/man/man-db/ in the package description.
  * Remove an autoconf hack from aclocal.m4; the bug it's working around is
    now fixed and the hack broke with autoconf 2.50 (closes: #98916).
  * Set gxditview's fontpath in debian/rules, restoring
    /usr/local/share/groff/font.
  * Preserve the Makefile to avoid a large diff.
  * Back out single-page an.tmac patch; upstream did it more neatly.

groff (1.16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fixed src/roff/nroff.sh, which was too much different from the
    previous one to apply the dumb patch. 
    Thanx to Taketoshi Sano for the right patch!
    (that was exactly the reason for using experimental instead of
    unstable: uploading something broken and ask for help to fix it,
    yeah!)

groff (1.15.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * re-enabled default font in Dvi.c, thanx to Kevin Ryde.
    closes: #63491, but opens probably some other i18n related bug,
    sigh.
  * changed version to 1.15.3 (waiting for 1.16 :-) to be grater than
    the version in slink and than the one in potato.
    This means that I must reupload the sources ... which were gone from
    woody anyway (why it's possible?).
  * Applyed patch submitted by Tomohiro KUBOTA:
    * Added a new device type 'ascii8', which is 8 bit clean (like latin1)
      but does not use Latin-1 character for hyphenation and so on (like
      ascii).  This device is intended to be used for codesets other than
      ASCII and ISO-8859-1.  This device should be temporal till all
      charsets (ISO-8859-*, KOI8-R, EUC-KR, EUC-ZH, TIS620, and so on so on)
      in the world are implemented, though this is almost impossible.
    * Added a new character 'sy', which is soft hyphen.  This character is
      defined only for latin1 device.  This 'sy' is used for hyphenation
      instead of [char173], because [char173] may not be a soft hyphen,
      though [char173] is a soft hyphen in ISO-8859-1.
      Tomohiro KUBOTA <kubota@debian.or.jp>  Wed, 19 Apr 2000 23:47:18 +0900
    This closes: #62840.

    even if the sources in the distribution, including the COPYING file)
    still point tro the old file (this should be reported as a bug to
