Q2.1 -- What is this newsgroup?

   Date: May 28, 1996

   The Usenet newsgroup comp.mail.sendmail is dedicated to the discussion
   of the program named "sendmail" in all its various forms. It is most
   commonly found on computers running a flavor of the Operating System
   known as Unix, or derived from Unix.

   This program has been ported to other OSes, but those versions have
   typically been ported by a particular vendor and are considered
   proprietary. There are many versions of sendmail, but the original
   author (Eric Allman) is continuing development on a particular version
   typically referred to as "Version Eight" or sometimes just "V8". This
   is considered by many to be the One True Version. This is also the
   version that this FAQ is centered around.

   If you have a question that amounts to "How do I send mail to my
   friend?", then you're in the wrong newsgroup. You should first check
   with your System or E-Mail Administrator(s), BBS SysOp(s), etc...
   before you post your question publicly, since the answer will likely
   be very highly dependent on what software and hardware you have. You
   also don't want to embarrass yourself publicly, nor do you want to
   annoy the kinds of people who are likely to be the counterparts of
   your System or E-Mail Administrator(s), BBS SysOp(s), etc.... If
   asking them doesn't do you any good, make sure you read this FAQ and
   the other mail-related FAQs at the archive sites listed below.

   If you have a question about another program similar to sendmail
   (technically referred to as an "SMTP MTA"), an SMTP Gateway package,
   or a LAN email package, then you should see if there is another group
   in the comp.mail hierarchy that more closely matches the particular
   program you want to ask a question about. For example, the SMTP MTA
   known as Smail has comp.mail.smail dedicated to it. The Mail User
   Agent (MUA) Eudora has two newsgroups dedicated to it
   (comp.mail.eudora.mac and comp.mail.eudora.ms-windows), depending on
   which hardware platform you use. If there isn't a more appropriate
   newsgroup, try comp.mail.misc. Again, make sure your question isn't
   already addressed in one of the mail-related FAQs or other available
   documentation. See the IMC website (more info below) for a good list
   of mail-related FAQs.

   If you have a question about an older or vendor-proprietary version of
   sendmail, be prepared for a lot of answers that amount to "Get V8".
   Version 8 isn't a panacea, but it does solve many problems known to
   plague previous versions, as well as having many new features that
   make it much easier to administer large or complex sites. In many
   cases, it makes at least possible what was previously virtually
   impossible, and relatively easy the previously difficult.

   There are, of course, many alternative programs that have sprung up in
   an attempt to answer one or another weakness or perceived fault of
   sendmail, but so far, none of them have had the kind of success it
   would require to unseat it as the de facto standard program for
   sending Internet mail. Obviously, this forum should not be used to
   discuss the merits of any of the alternative programs versus sendmail.
   These kinds of discussions should be taken to comp.mail.misc, or you
   should agitate to get a new newsgroup or newsgroup hierarchy created
   where that sort of thing is acceptable (or even the norm, such as a
   comp.mail.advocacy or news:comp.mail.mta.advocacy newsgroup).
     _________________________________________________________________

Subject: Q2.2 -- What is the scope of this FAQ?

   Date: April 9, 1997

   This FAQ is strongly centered around version 8 sendmail, for many
   reasons. First and foremost, this is the area of most interest on the
   part of the maintainers of this FAQ. Secondly, version 8 is where most
   of the additional development is being concentrated. Version 8
   sendmail is also the best documented of all SMTP MTAs, by virtue of
   the book by Bryan Costales (see entry
   sendmail-faq//book/ISBN/1-56592-222-0 in Q6.1).

   Other versions of sendmail get mentioned in passing, and some
   interesting interactions between version 8 and various OSes is also
   covered.

   This FAQ is aimed primarily at the experienced Unix System
   Administrator/Postmaster/DNS Domain Administrator. If you're looking
   for introductory texts, see the references in Q6.1.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q2.3 -- Where can I find the latest version of this FAQ?

   Date: February 20, 1998

   We post changes as they occur to the sendmail FAQ support page at
   http://www.sendmail.org/faq/.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q2.4 -- Where can I send comments, questions and bug reports?

   Date: April 26, 2006

   First, please refer to our E-mail Addresses page
   (http://www.sendmail.org/misc/email-addresses.php), which has a more
   complete answer.

   Next, if you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to
   the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to
   sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before
   posting and follow the netiquette. Also, if you do not have access to
   an NNTP server, you might want to use Google Groups.

   Finally, e-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do not send
   questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead;
   replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these
   addresses):
     * < sendmail-YYYY (at) support.sendmail.org > for contributing
       patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions
       how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
     * < sendmail-bugs-YYYY (at) support.sendmail.org > to report
       implementation bugs;
     * < sendmail-faq-YYYY (at) support.sendmail.org > only for comments
       / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with
       "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are
       referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ:
       general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
     * < sendmail-security-YYYY (at) support.sendmail.org > (use this
       only to report security related bugs or problems in sendmail).
       Please do not use this to ask about problems with your
       configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own
       certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc.
       All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also,
       please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using
       telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet
       design for SMTP, and not a sendmail bug. Please use PGP for
       encryption to send mail to this address.
     * < sendmail-mirror-YYYY (at) support.sendmail.org > for updates
       about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
     * < webmaster-YYYY (at) support.sendmail.org > for comments about
       the website.

   Note: remove all spaces in those addresses and replace "(at)" with "@"
   (without the quotes).

   If you post a message to comp.mail.sendmail and send it to one of the
   above addresses, please clearly indicate so at the top of your
   message.

   Also, please don't send HTML or graphics; plain text is sufficient.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q2.5 -- Where can I ask email-related DNS questions?

   Date: March 23, 1996

   Depending on how deeply they get into the DNS, they can be asked here.
   However, you'll probably be told that you should send them to the
   Usenet newsgroup comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains (DNS in general) or to
   the Info-BIND mailing list (if the question is specific to that
   program).
     _________________________________________________________________

Q2.6 -- How can I subscribe to these?

   Date: June 19, 1997

   For comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains, you have to be on Usenet. They
   don't have a news-to-mail gateway yet (I'm working on this), but they
   do have a FAQ.

   Questions from all levels of experience can be found on this newsgroup
   (as well as people to answer them), so don't be shy about asking a
   question you think may be too simple.

Q2.7 -- Which version of sendmail should I run?

   Date: April 8, 1997
   Updated: March 7, 2000

   If you're concerned at all about the security of your machines, you
   should make sure you're at least running a recent release of version 8
   sendmail (either from your vendor or the public version detailed in
   Q2.8).

   Check the CERT Alerts and Summaries to make sure that you're running a
   version that is free of known security holes. Just because the
   sendmail program provided by your vendor isn't listed doesn't mean
   that you're not vulnerable, however. If your particular vendor or
   version isn't listed, check with your vendor and on the appropriate
   Internet mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups to verify.

   If nothing else, the most recent public version is usually a pretty
   good bet, although you should check comp.mail.sendmail to see if
   anyone has posted recent comments that haven't yet been folded into a
   new release.

   That said, you need to look at what the primary function is for the
   machine. If its primary function is to run some CAD/CAM package on the
   desk of an engineer, then there's probably not much sense in replacing
   the vendor-supplied version of sendmail (assuming it's secure,
   according to the CERT Alerts and Summaries). Just set the machine up
   to forward all outbound mail to a central mail relay, and then worry
   about making that central mail relay the best it can be. Also arrange
   to have all their inbound mail pass through a central Mail eXchanger
   (probably the same machine as the central Mail Relay), for the same
   reasons.

   If the primary function for a machine is to act as that central Mail
   Relay/Mail eXchanger, then we *strongly* recommend the best version of
   sendmail you can get, and in our opinion that is the latest release of
   version 8. IDA sendmail is also pretty good, but virtually everything
   it does, version 8 does better, and version 8 has the additional
   advantage of having continued development as well.

   If fighting spam is a concern, then by all means upgrade to 8.10.X .
   8.9.X has good anti-spam features, but 8.10.X has even more features,
   and the anti-spam ones are more flexible than those in 8.9.X .

   However, keep in mind that version 8 still hasn't been ported (so far
   as we know) to some of the older (and perhaps more esoteric)
   platforms, and if you're stuck using one of them, you may not have
   much choice.

   Some vendors have started shipping (or announced that they will soon
   ship) version 8 sendmail pre-configured for their machines.
   Unfortunately, in most cases this means you get a pre-compiled binary
   and a sendmail.cf file (that may need a bit of tweaking), but not much
   else of the "standard" version 8 sendmail installation kit. Silicon
   Graphics (SGI) and Hewlett-Packard are known to already be shipping
   version 8 sendmail in this fashion.

   Sun Microsystems did the same with SunOS 5.5, 5.5.1 and 5.6, shipping
   a version based on 8.6 with their own proprietary config files. Recent
   patches for 5.5.1 and 5.6, however, upgrade to a version based on
   8.8.8 with a sendmail.cf that is only slightly tweaked. More
   importantly, a cf hierarchy is available under /usr/lib/mail/. More
   details are available at the Sun migration page.

Q2.8 -- What is the latest release of sendmail?

   Date: October 24, 1997
   Updated: April 3, 2007

   For version 8 sendmail, there are six release trees.

   For those people who, for whatever reason, are unable or unwilling to
   upgrade to version 8.14.x, releases of versions 8.13, 8.12, 8.11, 8.10
   and 8.9 sendmail are still available but are not being updated. The

   8.10 was 8.10.2; the last release of 8.11 was 8.11.6; the last release
   of 8.12 was 8.12.11; the last release of 8.13 was 8.13.8 .

   Version 8.14.1 was released on April 3, 2007.
   Version 8.14.0 was released on January 31, 2007.
   Version 8.13.8 was released on August 9, 2006.
   Version 8.13.7 was released on June 14, 2006.
   Version 8.13.6 was released on March 22, 2006.

   Version 8.9.1 was released on July 2, 1998.
   Version 8.9.0 was released on May 20, 1998.

   On machines exposed directly to the Internet, you should either
   already be running sendmail 8.14.1 or plan on upgrading in the
   immediate future. 8.14.1 is considered "stable", has fixes included
   that will not be found in any previous release, and therefore
   supercedes all previous releases.

   There is no further support for previous releases of sendmail.

Q2.9 -- Where can I find it?

   Date: January 21, 1997
   Updated: March 7, 2000

   By anonymous FTP from ftp.sendmail.org in /pub/sendmail, or (in URL
   form) via ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/. If you care, there
   should be files in this directory that end with the extension ".sig"
   which you can check with PGP to make sure that corresponding archives
   haven't been modified. You'll need to have the PGP signing key of
   Sendmail.ORG on your public keyring to be able to verify these
   archives with their associated .sig files.

   There are no other known official version 8 sendmail mirrors.

   Check the sendmail home page at http://www.sendmail.org/ for
   late-breaking updates and other useful information.

   If you want to be notified regarding future updates to sendmail and
   other items of potential interest, you may want to subscribe to the
   sendmail-announce mailing list. Address your subscription requests to
   "majordomo@lists.sendmail.org" with "subscribe sendmail-announce" as
   the body of the message.

Q2.10 -- What are the differences between Version 8 and other versions?

   Date: March 23, 1996

   See doc/changes/changes.{me,ps} in the distribution. See also
   RELEASE_NOTES at the top level.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q2.11 -- What's the best platform for running sendmail?

   Date: April 8, 1997

   Generally speaking, I adhere to the old axiom that you should choose
   what software you want to run first, then choose the platform
   (hardware and OS) that best runs this software. By this token, if
   sendmail is the software, then a recent version of BSD Unix would
   probably be best, since sendmail was developed at UC Berkeley on BSD
   Unix. FreeBSD and BSD/OS are two known implementations of BSD Unix for
   Intel-based PC's (among other hardware platforms), and this would make
   them the most "native" OSes for sendmail. FreeBSD is freely available
   by anonymous ftp or on CD-ROM, and BSD/OS is a commercial product.

   However, not everyone has this kind of "luxury". If you're on a
   homogeneous network (i.e., completely composed of only one type of
   hardware and OS), then you should probably be running the same OS as
   the rest of the machines on the network, regardless of the axiom
   stated above. You may have other problems, but you should at least be
   able to get some local support on the OS for your machine.

   Either way, if the primary function of the machine is to handle
   "large" quantities of mail (for whatever value you define "large" to
   be), I strongly recommend getting the latest stable release of version
   8 sendmail.

   You may be surprised to find that it is easier for you to support only
   one version of sendmail across all the various platforms than it is to
   try to support multiple versions of sendmail, each unique for their
   particular platform. In that case, the easy solution is to put version
   8 sendmail everywhere, and not have to worry about vendor-specific
   problems with older versions.

   For more information on BSD Unix in general, see the Usenet newsgroups
   under comp.unix.bsd, comp.bugs.4bsd, comp.os.386bsd. For more
   information on BSD/OS, see the BSD newsgroups mentioned above, or the
   BSD/OS Home Page at http://www.bsdi.com/. For more information on
   FreeBSD, see the Usenet newsgroups under news:comp.unix.bsd.freebsd,
   or the FreeBSD Home Page at http://www.freebsd.org/.

Q2.12 -- What is BIND and where can I get the latest version?

   Date: June 24, 1997

   BIND stands for "Berkeley Internet Name Daemon", and is the Internet
   de-facto standard program for turning host names into IP addresses.

   The BIND Home Page is at http://www.isc.org/bind.html, which provides
   pointers to the most recent release of BIND. In May of 1997, the first
   production version of BIND-8 was released. The ISC has deprecated
   BIND-4 other than for security related patches. No new features or
   portability changes will be added to BIND-4. You should be using
   BIND-8.

   Note that there are bugs in older resolver libraries, which can cause
   problems getting to large sites (that list more than five IP addresses
   for a particular name), or represent a huge security hole as they do
   not check the returned data to see if it will fit in the amount of
   space pre-allocated for it.

   If at all possible, you should get the most recent "release" version
   of BIND and make a serious attempt to integrate it into your
   configuration, since virtually all vendor-provided resolver libraries
   are woefully out of date.

   Note that since the release of BIND version 8.1, many people building
   sendmail have experienced problems compiling and linking with the new
   BIND include files and libraries under /usr/local/. A section in our
   Compiling Sendmail page explains this.

Q2.13 -- What is smrsh and where can I get it?

   Date: July 9, 1996
   Updated: July 1, 2000

   smrsh is a restricted shell utility that provides the ability to
   specify, through a configuration, an explicit list of executable
   programs. When used in conjunction with sendmail, smrsh effectively
   limits sendmail's scope of program execution to only those programs
   specified in smrsh's configuration.

   smrsh has been written with portability in mind, and uses traditional
   Unix library utilities. As such, smrsh should compile on most Unix C
   compilers.

   The purpose for restricting the list of programs that can be executed
   in this manner is to keep mail messages (either through an alias or
   the .forward file in a user's home directory) from being sent to
   arbitrary programs which are not necessarily known to be sufficiently
   paranoid in checking their input, and can therefore be easily
   subverted (this is related to, but different from, the /etc/shells
   feature discussed in Q3.11).

   More information regarding the CERT-CC can be found at their web site,
   http://www.cert.org. For more information on CERT Alerts and CERT
   Summaries, see their advisories and summaries, respectively.

   You can find smrsh in the most recent sendmail source archive. Other
   very useful programs can be found in
   http://www.cert.org/other_sources/tool_sources.html.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q2.14 -- What is smap and where can I get it?

   Date: July 5, 1996

   Smap (and smapd) are tools out of the Trusted Information Systems
   (TIS) Firewall Toolkit (fwtk). They were originally written by
   firewall expert Marcus Ranum under contract to TIS, and TIS is
   continuing what maintenance there is. Here is a link to the toolkit.
   Support questions regarding the toolkit may be sent to
   fwall-support@tis.com, while you may join their mailing list
   fwall-users@tis.com by sending electronic mail to
   fwall-users-request@tis.com.

   The concept of smap and smapd is that sendmail is a huge, monolithic
   setuid root program that is virtually impossible to verify as being
   "correct" and free from bugs (historically, sendmail has been rather
   buggy and an easy mark for system crackers to exploit, although with
   the advent of version 8 sendmail, this becomes much more difficult).
   In contrast, smap and smapd are very small (only a few hundred lines
   long), and relatively easy to verify as being correct and functioning
   as designed (however, as you will see later, we can question their
   design). According to the theory, it is therefore safer and "better"
   to run smap and smapd as "wrappers" around sendmail, which would no
   longer need to be run setuid root.

   Unfortunately, smap and smapd have a few problems of their own, and
   don't appear to have been updated since late March 1996. There have
   been conflicting reports of incompatibilities between smapd and
   sendmail 8.7.y (both cannot be run on the same machine, although if
   you're running sendmail 8.6.x and smap/smapd on the local machine,
   people on the outside can still use sendmail 8.7.y to talk to you).

   For further information on smap and smapd, see the documentation that
   comes with the TIS Firewall Toolkit.

Q2.15 -- What is TCP-Wrappers and where can I get it?

   Date: April 8, 1997
   Updated: April 2, 2001

   TCP-Wrappers is another security enhancement package. The theory is
   that you take programs being run under inetd (see /etc/inetd.conf) and
   before you run the program to do the real work (ftpd, telnetd,
   etc...), you first run the connection attempt through a package that
   checks to see if the IP address of the source packet is coming from a
   host known to be either good or bad (you may filter connection
   attempts by source host name, domain name, raw IP address, port they
   are attempting to connect to; and either allow known good connections
   through thus refusing unknown connections, or accept all connections
   except those known to be bad).

   The practice of TCP-Wrappers actually follows the theory quite well.
   It is a very useful and important tool in the System Administrator's
   Bag of Things To Help You Secure Your Machine From Crackers, Spammers,
   Junkmailers, and Other Undesirables. However, it only works for
   programs that communicate via TCP packets (not UDP, such as NFS)
   started up out of inetd. It does not work for RPC-based services, and
   programs that start up a daemon outside of inetd and just leave it
   running obviously don't benefit beyond the initial connection that
   gets the daemon started (however, see the FTP URL below for other
   packages that can help secure RPC and portmapper-based services).

   However, most sendmail installations tend to start up a daemon and
   leave it running at all times. If you did run sendmail out of inetd,
   you'd lose the benefit of the load average checking code that is
   executed only in daemon mode, and for systems that handle a lot of
   mail, this is vitally important.

   You can get TCP-Wrappers from ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/, a
   site that has a whole host of other useful security tools, such as
   securelib, portmap, satan, cops, crack, etc... You can also find
   pointers to many other useful security tools at
   http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/SecurityTools.html, and the COAST Archive at
   http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/coast/ is a veritable cornucopia of all
   things security related.

   For the adventurous, you can get a source patch for version 8 sendmail
   (created for 8.7.6, but, with work, applicable to older releases) that
   will take the core TCP-Wrappers code and integrate it into the daemon,
   so that you get the best of both worlds. However, this isn't as
   smoothly integrated as it should be, is not for the faint-of-heart,
   and is certainly not officially supported by the original author of
   sendmail (Eric Allman). This functionality is integrated in a
   different fashion into version 8.8.5 sendmail.

   You should be able to find the unsupported patch at
   ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/sendmail-tcpd.patch.

Q2.16 -- Why won't db 1.85 build on my machine?

   Date: April 8, 1997
   Updated: May 20, 1997
   URL Updated: July 27, 1999

   As of release 8.9.X of sendmail, db 1.85 is no longer needed, as
   support for db 2.X is included (starting with 2.3.16). More details
   are given at Q3.25. The rest of this answer only applies if you have
   not yet upgraded to 8.9.X .

   The db 1.85 package as available from
   http://www.sleepycat.com/register.html provides Irix support up to
   Irix 4.05F, but 5.{2,3} need a slightly patched version, as does HP-UX
   10.20. Some vendors also provide db standard with their OS (DEC Unix
   4.0, for example).

   A tarball incorporating these changes for Irix 5.x is available at
   ftp://ftp.his.com/pub/brad/sendmail/irix5.tar.gz. This will extract
   into ./db.1.85/PORT/irix.5.2, with a symbolic link created from
   ./db.1.85/PORT/irix.5.3 to this same directory. Make sure you extract
   this archive into the same directory where you extracted the db 1.85
   archive as available from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu. (see Q3.5 for more
   information on getting the db 1.85 package). An ASCII context diff of
   this same patch is at
   ftp://ftp.his.com/pub/brad/sendmail/irix4-5.diff.

   A version of db 1.85 that has supposedly been patched to compile under
   Irix 6.2 has been made available at
   http://reality.sgi.com/ariel/freeware/#db, but I haven't had a chance
   to download and check it out yet.

   The context diffs required to get db 1.85 working under HP-UX 10.20
   are available at ftp://ftp.his.com/pub/brad/sendmail/hpux.10.20.diff.
   A tarball incorporating these changes is available at
   ftp://ftp.his.com/pub/brad/sendmail/hp-ux.10.20.tar.gz. This will
   extract into ./db.1.85/PORT/hpux.10.20, so make sure you extract this
   archive into the same directory where you extracted the db 1.85
   archive as available from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.

Q2.17 -- What is makemap and where can I get it?

   Date: August 30, 1996

   The program "makemap" is used to build the databases used by version 8
   sendmail, for things like the UserDB, mailertables, etc....

   It is distributed as part of the basic operating system from some
   vendors, but source code for it is also included at the root level of
   the sendmail archive (at least, it is for sendmail 8.6.12 and 8.7.5,
   and presumably will continue to be as newer releases come out).
   However, it is not considered a "supported" part of version 8
   sendmail. Just like the other source provided in the archive, the
   Makefile will likely need some tweaking for your specific site.

   It turns out that Irix 5.3 doesn't appear to have the dbm or ndbm
   libraries, but to compile makemap.c, you need to have -DNDBM on the
   "DBMDEF=" line (some necessary things are defined only in
   /usr/include/ndbm.h). Try just leaving off "-lndbm" from the "LIBS="
   line in the Makefile for makemap.

   If you plan on using makemap with db 1.85 on an SGI machine running a
   version of Irix later than 4.x, see Q2.16 for some additional steps to
   get db 1.85 compiled on your machine.

Q3.2 -- How do I rewrite my From: lines to read ``First_Last@My.Domain''' or
``Different_Name@My.Domain''?

   Date: September 23, 1997
   Updated: November 8, 1999

   Use the generics table, as described in steps 6 and 7 of the Virtual
   Hosting page.

Q3.3 -- But what about fully-qualified addresses, such as those from Pine or
FEATURE(always_add_domain)?

   Date: July 19, 1996
   Updated: November 8, 1999
   Updated: January 25, 2000

   Note: this question used to be "How do I get the user database to work
   with Pine or with FEATURE(always_add_domain)?" But the user database
   is no longer the recommended solution for this problem, so the
   question has been clarified appropriately.

   The proper solution is to use the generics table, as described in
   steps 6 and 7 of the Virtual Hosting page. The important thing to note
   is that the host/domain part of the fully-qualified address must be
   specified via GENERICS_DOMAIN() or GENERICS_DOMAIN_FILE().

Q3.4 -- So what was the user database feature intended for?

   Date: May 12, 1997

   The intent was to have all information for a given user (where the
   user is the unique login name, not an inherently non-unique full name)
   in one place. This would include phone numbers, addresses, and so
   forth. The "maildrop" feature is because Berkeley does not use a
   centralized mail server (there are a number of reasons for this that
   are mostly historic), and so we need to know where each user gets his
   or her mail delivered -- i.e., the mail drop.

   UC Berkeley is (was) in the process of setting up their environment so
   that mail sent to an unqualified "name" goes to that person's
   preferred maildrop; mail sent to "name@host" goes to that host. The
   purpose of "FEATURE(notsticky)" is to cause "name@host" to be looked
   up in the user database for delivery to the maildrop.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.5 -- Why the hostility toward using full names for email addresses?

   Date: May 12, 1997
   Updated: April 7, 2004

   Because full names are not unique. For example, the computer community
   has two Peter Deutsches. At one time, Bell Labs had two Stephen R.
   Bournes with offices a few doors apart. You can create alternative
   addresses (e.g., Stephen_R_Bourne_2), but that's even worse -- which
   one of them has to have their name desecrated in this way? And you can
   bet that one of them will get most of the other person's email.
   Moreover, at institutions with high turnover (such as universities), a
   given name may refer to different people at different times, which can
   again lead to mail going to the wrong person.

   So called "full names" are just an attempt to create longer versions
   of unique names. Rather that lulling people into a sense of security,
   I'd rather that it be clear that these handles are arbitrary. People
   should use good user agents that have alias mappings so that they can
   attach arbitrary names for their personal use to those with whom they
   correspond (such as the MH alias file).

   The problem is even worse outside of America, where non-ASCII
   characters (e.g., characters with umlauts or the Norwegian ) are used
   in names. Since non-ASCII characters cannot be used in the SMTP
   envelope or e-mail headers, the full names are mangled anyway.

   Even worse is fuzzy matching in email -- this can make good addresses
   turn bad. For example, Eric Allman is currently (to the best of our
   knowledge) the only ``Allman'' at Berkeley, so mail sent to
   <Allman@Berkeley.EDU> should get to him. But if another Allman ever
   appears, this address could suddenly become ambiguous. He's been the
   only Allman at Berkeley for over fifteen years -- to suddenly have
   this "good address" bounce mail because it is ambiguous would be a
   heinous wrong.

   Directory services should be as fuzzy as possible (within reason, of
   course). Mail services should be unique.

   Date: April 8, 1997
   Updated: May 9, 2000
   Updated: June 8, 2002
   Updated: March 2, 2003

   If you are just getting occasional such messages, they're probably due
   to a temporary network problem, or the remote host crashing or
   otherwise abruptly terminating the connection. If you are getting a
   lot of these from a single host, there is probably some
   incompatibility between 8.x and that host (see Q3.12 and Q3.20). If
   you get a lot of them in general, you may have network problems that
   are causing connections to get reset.

   Note that this problem is sometimes caused by incompatible values of
   the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) size on a SLIP or PPP connection.
   Be sure that your MTU size is configured to be the same value as what
   your ISP has configured for your connection. If you are still having
   problems, then have your ISP configure your MTU size for 1500 (the
   maximum value), and you configure your MTU size similarly.

   Another possibility is that you have a router/firewall filtering out
   all incoming ICMP messages, while your OS is doing "Path MTU
   discovery" (e.g. modern TCP/IP stacks do this by default). Path MTU
   discovery relies on certain ICMP messages being allowed through back
   to the host originating the traffic - see our tip on Path MTU
   Discovery and RFC 1191 for the details.

   Lastly, here is part of a post from comp.mail.sendmail about a SCO
   7.1.0 specific bug which may produce similar problems.

     Subject: Re: Recipient mail server times out sendmail connection
     Date: 5 Jun 2002 21:37:02 -0700
     From: maillist@screamingplants.com (ike)

     I ran a packet sniffer on mail traffic that was causing problems
     and found that the tcp checksums for large packets were all off by
     14. I found out later that there is a network bug in the OS (SCO
     7.1.0). After applying a few patches, the problem appears to have
     been resolved.

Q3.11 -- Why can't my users forward their mail to a program?

   Date: July 9, 1996
   Updated: November 19, 1999

   I just upgraded to version 8 sendmail and now when my users try to
   forward their mail to a program they get an "illegal shell" or "cannot
   mail to programs" message and their mail is not delivered. What's
   wrong?

   In order for people to be able to run a program from their .forward
   file, version 8 sendmail insists that their shell (that is, the shell
   listed for that user in the passwd entry) be a "valid" shell, meaning
   a shell listed in /etc/shells. If /etc/shells does not exist, a
   default list is used, typically consisting of /bin/sh and /bin/csh.

   This is to support environments that may have NFS-shared directories
   mounted on machines on which users do not have login permission. For
   example, many people make their file server inaccessible for
   performance or security reasons; although users have directories,
   their shell on the server is /usr/local/etc/nologin or some such. If
   you allowed them to run programs anyway you might as well let them log
   in.

   If you are willing to let users run programs from their .forward file
   even though they cannot telnet or rsh in (as might be reasonable if
   you run smrsh to control the list of programs they can run) then add
   the line:

   /SENDMAIL/ANY/SHELL/

   to /etc/shells. This must be typed exactly as indicated, in caps, with
   the trailing slash.

   NOTA BENE: DO NOT list /usr/local/etc/nologin in /etc/shells -- this
   will open up other security problems.

   IBM AIX does not use /etc/shells -- a list of allowable login shells
   is contained, along with many other login parameters, in
   /etc/security/login.cfg. You can copy the information in the "shells="
   stanza into a /etc/shells on your system so sendmail will have
   something to use. Do NOT add "/usr/lib/uucp/uucico" or any other
   non-login shell into /etc/shells.

   Also note that there are some weird things that AFS throws into the
   mix, and these can keep a program from running or running correctly
   out of .forward files or the system-wide aliases.

   See also "smrsh" in Q2.13 and Q3.34, and "directory permissions" in
   Q3.33.

Q3.12 -- Why do connections to the SMTP port take such a long time?

   Date: November 24, 1996
   Updated: August 29, 2001

   I just upgraded to version 8 sendmail and suddenly connections to the
   SMTP port take a long time. What is going wrong?

   It's probably something weird in your TCP implementation that makes
   the IDENT code act oddly. On most systems version 8 sendmail tries to
   do a ``callback'' to the connecting host to get a validated user name
   (see RFC 1413 for detail). If the connecting host does not support
   such a service it will normally fail quickly with "Connection
   refused", but certain kinds of packet filters and certain TCP
   implementations just time out.

   To test this (pre-8.7.y sendmail), set the IDENT timeout to zero
   using:

   define(`confREAD_TIMEOUT',`Ident=0')dnl

   in the .mc file used by m4 to generate your sendmail.cf file.
   Alternatively, if you don't use m4, you can put ``OrIdent=0'' in the
   configuration file (we recommend the m4 solution, since that makes
   maintenance much easier for people who don't understand sendmail
   re-write rules, or after you've been away from it for a while). Either
   way, this will completely disable all use of the IDENT protocol.

   For version 8.7.y sendmail (and above), you should instead use:

   define(`confTO_IDENT',`0s')dnl

   Another possible problem is that you have your name server and/or
   resolver configured improperly. Make sure that all "nameserver"
   entries in /etc/resolv.conf point to functional servers. If you are
   running your own server, make certain that all the servers listed in
   your root cache are up to date (this file is usually called something
   like "/var/namedb/root.cache"; see your /etc/named.boot file to get
   your value). Either of these can cause long delays.

   private address space.

Q3.13 -- Why do I get "unknown mailer error 5 -- mail: options MUST PRECEDE
recipients" errors?

   Date: March 23, 1996

   I just upgraded to version 8 sendmail and suddenly I get errors such
   as ``unknown mailer error 5 -- mail: options MUST PRECEDE
   recipients.'' What is going wrong?

   You need OSTYPE(systype) in your .mc file, where "systype" is set
   correctly for your hardware & OS combination -- otherwise the
   configurations use a default that probably disagrees with your local
   mail system. See the configuration OSTYPE page for details.

   If this is on a Sun workstation, you might also want to take a look at
   the local mailer flags in the Sun-supplied sendmail.cf and compare
   them to the local mailer flags generated for your version 8
   sendmail.cf. If they differ, you might try changing the V8 flags to
   match the Sun flags.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.14 -- Why does version 8 sendmail panic my SunOS box?

   Date: March 24, 1996
   Updated: November 4, 1997

   Sendmail 8.7.y panics SunOS 4.1.3_U1 (at least for 1 <= y <= 3) and
   SunOS 4.1.3, and sendmail 8.6.x seems fine on both machines (at least
   for 9 <= x <= 12).

   The problem is that a kernel patch is missing, specifically 100584-08
   (4.1.3), 102010-05 (4.1.3_U1), or 102517 (4.1.4). This should be
   available from your hardware vendor through your support contract or
   their online support facilities (including being available on the
   SunSolve CD).

Q3.15 -- Why does the Unix From line get mysteriously munged when I send to an
alias?

   Date: December 3, 1997

   ``It's not a bug, it's a feature.'' This happens when you have an
   owner-list alias and you send to list. V8 propagates the owner
   information into the SMTP envelope sender field (which appears as the
   Unix From line [sometimes incorrectly referred to as the From-space
   "header"] on Unix mail or as the Return-Path: header) so that
   downstream errors are properly returned to the mailing list owner
   instead of to the sender. In order to make this appear as sensible as
   possible to end users, I recommend making the owner point to a
   "request" address -- for example:
        list:           :include:/path/name/list.list
        owner-list:     list-request
        list-request:   eric

   This will make message sent to list come out as being "From
   list-request" instead of "From eric".
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.16 -- Why doesn't MASQUERADE_AS (or the user database) work for envelope
addresses as well as header addresses?

   Date: November 24, 1996

   Believe it or not, this is intentional. The interpretation of the
   standards by the version 8 sendmail development group was that this
   was an inappropriate rewriting, and that if the rewriting were
   incorrect at least the envelope would contain a valid return address.

   If you're using version 8.7.y sendmail (or later), you can use
        FEATURE(masquerade_envelope)

   in your sendmail.mc file to change this behavior. This is discussed in
   greater detail at the configuration Masquerading and Relaying page.

     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.18 -- Why do messages disappear from my queue unsent?

   Date: March 23, 1996

   When I look in the queue directory I see that qf* files have been
   renamed to Qf*, and sendmail doesn't see these. What's wrong?

   If you look closely you should find that the Qf files are owned by
   users other than root. Since sendmail runs as root it refuses to
   believe information in non-root-owned qf files, and it renames them to
   Qf to get them out of the way and make it easy for you to find. The
   usual cause of this is twofold: first, you have the queue directory
   world writable (which is probably a mistake -- this opens up other
   security problems) and someone is calling sendmail with an "unsafe"
   flag, usually a -o flag that sets an option that could compromise
   security. When sendmail sees this it gives up setuid root permissions.

   The usual solution is to not use the problematic flags. If you must
   use them, you have to write a special queue directory and have them
   processed by the same uid that submitted the job in the first place.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.19 -- When is sendmail going to support RFC 2047 MIME header encoding?

   Date: March 23, 1996
   Updated: September 5, 1999

   This is considered to be a MUA issue rather than an MTA issue.

   Quoth Eric Allman:

     The primary reason is that the information necessary to do the
     encoding (that is, 8->7 bit) is unknown to the MTA. In specific,
     the character set used to encode names in headers is _NOT_
     necessarily the same as used to encode the body (which is already
     encoded in MIME in the charset parameter of the Content-Type:
     header). Furthermore, it is perfectly reasonable for, say, a Swede
     to be living and working in Korea, or a Russian living and working
     in Germany, and want their name to be encoded in their native
     character set; it could even be that the sender was Japanese, the
     recipient Russian, and the body encoded in ISO 8859-1. If all I
     have are 8-bit characters, I can't choose the charset properly.

     Similarly, when doing 7->8 bit conversions, I don't want to throw
     away this information, as it is necessary for proper presentation
     to the end user.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.20 -- Why can't I get mail to some places, but instead always get the error
"reply: read error from name.of.remote.host"?

   Date: January 17, 1997

   This is usually caused by a bug in the remote host's mail server, or
   Mail Transport Agent (MTA). The "EHLO" command of ESMTP causes the
   remote server to drop the SMTP connection. There are several MTAs that
   have this problem, but one of the most common server implementations
   can be identified by the "220 All set, fire away" greeting it gives
   when you telnet to its SMTP port.

   To work around this problem, you can configure sendmail to use a
   mailertable with an entry telling sendmail to use plain SMTP when
   talking to that host:

   name.of.remote.host smtp:name.of.remote.host

   Sites which must run a host with this broken SMTP implementation
   should do so by having a site running sendmail or some other reliable
   (and reasonably modern) SMTP MTA act as an MX server for the problem
   host.

   There is also a problem wherein some TCP/IP implementations are
   broken, and if any connection attempt to a remote end gets a
   "connection refused", then *all* connections to that site will get
   closed. Of course, if you try to use the IDENT protocol across a
   firewall (at either end), this is highly likely to result in the same
   apparent kind of "read error".

   The fix is simple -- on those machines with broken TCP/IP
   implementations, do not attempt to use IDENT. When compiling newer
   releases of version 8 sendmail, the compiler should automatically
   detect whether you're on a machine that is known to have this kind of
   TCP/IP networking problem, and make sure that sendmail does not
   attempt to use IDENT. If you've since patched your machine so that it
   no longer has this problem, you'll need to go back in and explicitly
   configure sendmail for support of IDENT, if you want that feature.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.21 -- Why doesn't "FEATURE(xxx)" work?

   Date: January 17, 1996

   When creating m4 Master Config (".mc") files for version 8 sendmail,
   many FEATURE() macros simply change the definition of internal
   variables that are referenced in the MAILER() definitions.

   To make sure that everything works as desired, you need to make sure
   that OSTYPE() macros are put at the very beginning of the file,
   followed by FEATURE() and HACK() macros, local definitions, and at the
   very bottom, the MAILER() definitions. See the configuration
   Introduction and Example page for more details.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.22 -- How do I configure sendmail not to use DNS?

   Date: March 24, 1997
   Updated: April 6, 2000
   Updated: June 4, 2002
   Updated: January 14, 2004

   In situations where you're behind a firewall, or across a dial-up
   line, there are times when you need to make sure that programs (such
   as sendmail) do not use the DNS at all.

   With older releases of version 8 sendmail (8.7 and earlier), you
   needed to recompile the binary and make sure that "NAMED_BIND" was
   turned off in src/conf.h.

   With versions 8.8 and later, you change the service switch file to
   omit "DNS" and use only NIS, files, and other map types as
   appropriate. More information about the service switch file can be
   found under the ServiceSwitchFile option in 5.6 (Options) of the
   Installation and Operation Guide and all of 4.9 (Name Server Access).

   And note that you'll need to forward all your outbound mail to another
   machine as a "relay" (one that does use DNS, and understands how to
   properly use MX records, etc...), otherwise you won't be able to get
   mail to any site(s) other than the one(s) you configure in your
   /etc/hosts file (or whatever). The use of a smart host is one way to
   do this; the following in your .mc will do:
define(`SMART_HOST', `name.of.smart.host')dnl

   Also, starting with 8.9, it may help to include the following in your
   .mc file:
FEATURE(`accept_unresolvable_domains')dnl
FEATURE(`accept_unqualified_senders')dnl

   And starting with 8.12, changes to submit.cf are required as well; the
   following in your submit.mc can minimize the problem:
define(`confDIRECT_SUBMISSION_MODIFIERS', `C')dnl

Q3.23 -- How do I get all my queued mail delivered to my Unix box from my ISP?

   Date: June 6, 1997
   Updated: October 8, 1998

   In the contrib directory of the sendmail distribution is a Perl script
   called etrn.pl. Assuming you're running sendmail or some other SMTP
   MTA on some sort of a Unix host, and your ISP uses version 8.8
   sendmail and they queue all mail for your domain (as opposed to
   stuffing it all in one file that you need to download via POP3 or some
   such), the command
        etrn.pl mail.myisp.com mydomain.com

   will do the trick. You can learn about Perl at the Perl Language Home
   Page. The O'Reilly book is also very helpful.

   If you don't have Perl, something like the following script should do
   the trick:
        #!/bin/sh
        telnet mail.myisp.com. 25 << __EOF__
        EHLO me.mydomain.com
        ETRN mydomain.com
        QUIT
        __EOF__

   Note that this is indented for readability, and the real script would
   have column position #1 of the file be the first printable character
   in each line.

   Of course, you'll have to fill in the appropriate details for
   "mail.myisp.com", "mydomain.com", etc....

   If your ISP doesn't use version 8.8 sendmail, you may have to cobble
   together alternative solutions. They may have a "ppplogin" script that
   is executed every time your machines dials them up, and if so, you may
   be able to have them modified this script so as to put a "sendmail
   -qRmydomain.com" in it (which is effectively what the "ETRN" command
   does, but in a safer fashion).

   Alternatively, they may have a hacked finger daemon, so that you'd put
   "finger mydomain.com@theirhost.theirdomain.com" in your script. Or,
   they may have some other solution for you. However, only they would be
   able to answer what solutions they have available to them.

   Obviously, the easiest and most "standard" solution is to have them
   upgrade their system to the most recent stable release of version 8
   sendmail. See Q2.8 to find out what exact version this is.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.24 -- Why do I get the error message unable to write /etc/mail/sendmail.pid?

   Date: August 6, 1997

   sendmail checks if it has write access to the directory in which it
   wants to create a file without granting special privileges to 'root'.
   To have sendmail run properly, the directories /etc, /etc/mail, and/or
   /var/run should be owned by root and be writable by its owner.

Q3.27 -- How do I prevent Relaying Denied errors for my clients?

   Date: April 12, 1998
   Last updated: June 19, 2000

   You need to add the fully-qualified host name and/or IP address of
   each client to class R, the set of relay-allowed domains. For version
   8.8.X, this is typically defined by the file /etc/sendmail.cR ; for
   8.9.X, it is typically /etc/mail/relay-domains . Note: if your DNS is
   problematic, you should list the IP address (e.g., 1.2.3.4); in
   general, however, this should not be necessary.

   Once you've updated the appropriate file, SIGHUP your sendmail daemon
   and you should be OK.

   Further details are available on our Allowing controlled SMTP relaying
   in Sendmail 8.9 page.

Q3.28 -- Why isn't virtual hosting working, even after I added a Kvirtuser line
to sendmail.cf?

   Date: April 12, 1998

   Just adding the proper Kvirtuser line to sendmail.cf is not enough to
   enable the virtual user table feature, a key ingredient for virtual
   hosting. You need to use the m4 technique FEATURE(virtusertable);
   detailed instructions are provided at our Virtual Hosting with
   Sendmail page.

Q3.29 -- How can I add a header specifying the actual recipient when having
multiple users in a virtual domain go to a single mailbox?

   Date: July 2, 1998
   Updated: June 21, 2002
   Fixed typo: October 10, 2003
   Updated URL: April 6, 2004

   Stuffing multiple user's mail into a single mail box is not a good
   method of distributing user mail but if you must do this, the
   following solution should allow a tool like fetchmail to separate the
   messages for individual users.
    1. Use FEATURE(local_procmail) in your .mc file so procmail (which
       you must install separately) will deliver mail to the mailbox.
    2. Use FEATURE(virtusertable) to create a virtual user table entry
       for the domain as follows:
@domain.com     domuser+%1
       where domuser is the username of the mailbox you will be using.
       Note that "domuser" must be an actual username, *not* an alias.
       It may be necessary to append "@localhost", as follows
@domain.com     domuser+%1@localhost
    3. Put this in the respective domuser's $HOME/.procmailrc:
DOMAIN=domain.com
ENV_TO=$1

:0f
* ENV_TO ?? .
| formail -i "X-Envelope-To: $ENV_TO@$DOMAIN"

:0fE
| formail -i "X-Envelope-To: UNKNOWN"
       This will insert an X-Envelope-To header with the original
       envelope recipient address when the message is delivered the
       normal way via the virtusertable, and UNKNOWN if for some reason
       it was sent directly to domuser.
       You may be tempted to eliminate variable ENV_TO and use $1
       directly. It won't work, so don't bother.
       FEATURE(local_procmail) causes sendmail to deliver email to
       procmail directly. A .forward file is not only unnecessary, it
       would prevent procmail from setting $1 with the necessary text, so
       don't use one.
       You may need to replace formail with /usr/local/bin/formail or
       some such, depending on whether procmail can find it or not.

   Another possible solution from Andrzej Filip.

Q3.30 -- What do I do when Build fails because groff was not found?

   Date: September 24, 1998

   You can get groff from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/. But it's not a big
   deal, because:
    1. You've already successfully built the sendmail binary to get this
       far.
    2. You can just use the preformatted man pages anyway:
% cp *.0 obj*

Q3.31 -- What does "class hash not available" mean?

   Date: September 24, 1998

   You've built sendmail and/or makemap without NEWDB specified in your
   DBMDEF configuration, but you specified the class hash in sendmail.cf
   or on a makemap command. The class hash requires NEWDB support, for
   which you need the Berkeley database. Please refer to the Database
   Definitions section of our Compiling Sendmail web page.

Q3.32 -- How do I configure majordomo with sendmail 8.9 without relaxing the
DontBlameSendmail option?

   Date: January 26, 1999
   Updated: October 30, 2001

   We have had some queries about this, as majordomo apparently suggests
   some configuration values which sendmail 8.9 does not like. Here is
   what one expert suggests:

   The sendmail.cf contains:
O AliasFile=/etc/aliases, /etc/majordomo.aliases
O DontBlameSendmail=Safe

   /etc/aliases contains the general majordomo aliases:
# Majordomo
majordomo: "|/usr/local/lib/majordomo/wrapper majordomo"
owner-majordomo: postmaster
majordomo-owner: postmaster

   /etc/majordomo.aliases contains the majordomo lists of the form:
wookie: "|/usr/local/lib/majordomo/wrapper resend -l wookie wookie-list"
wookie-list: :include:/usr/local/lib/majordomo/lists/wookie
owner-wookie: head-wookie
wookie-approval: owner-wookie
wookie-request: "|/usr/local/lib/majordomo/wrapper majordomo -l wookie"

   The various directory owners/groups/permissions:
drwxr-xr-x  20 root     root         1024 Dec  1 15:20 /
drwxr-xr-x  25 root     root         3072 Jan 26 01:26 /etc
drwxr-xr-x  20 root     root         1024 Feb  4  1998 /usr
drwxr-xr-x  18 root     root         1024 Jan 16 18:40 /usr/local
drwxr-xr-x   5 root     root         1024 Feb  6  1996 /usr/local/lib
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           16 Dec  1 10:01 /usr/local/lib/majordomo
 -> majordomo-1.94.4
drwxr-x--x   5 majordom majordom     1024 Jan 25 23:12 /usr/local/lib/majordomo
-1.94.4
drwxr-xr-x   2 majordom majordom    32768 Jan 26 00:49 /usr/local/lib/majordomo
-1.94.4/lists
-rw-rw-r--   1 majordom majordom      655 Nov  3 17:03 /usr/local/lib/majordomo
-1.94.4/lists/wookie
-rw-rw----   1 majordom majordom    14588 Jan 19 10:28 /usr/local/lib/majordomo
-1.94.4/lists/wookie.config
-rw-rw-r--   1 majordom majordom       23 Jan 14  1997 /usr/local/lib/majordomo
-1.94.4/lists/wookie.info

   Now the differences that make this work that may not be the same as
   instructed by the majordomo instructions:
    1. Put the majordomo.aliases file in /etc, not in the majordomo
       install directory (/usr/local/lib/majordomo). If you can't move
       the aliases file out of the majordomo directory, you'll need to
       create the database backing file by hand the first time as root:
    # touch /usr/local/lib/majordomo/aliases
    # newaliases -OAliasFile=/usr/local/lib/majordomo/aliases

    2. Make the permissions on /usr/local/lib/majordomo 0751, not 0775.
    3. Make the permissions on /usr/local/lib/majordomo/Log 0664, owned
       by majordom, group majordom.
    4. /usr/local/lib/majordomo/lists is mode 0755, owner majordom, group
       majordom.
    5. The permissions/owners for the lists should be as shown above.
       These permissions/ownership allow majordom to continue to manage
       the lists.

Q3.33 -- How do I configure my system in general with sendmail 8.9?

   Date: May 24, 1999

   The following is taken directly from the DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS section
   of the top-level README file in the sendmail distribution.

   Sendmail often gets blamed for many problems that are actually the
   result of other problems, such as overly permissive modes on
   directories. For this reason, sendmail checks the modes on system
   directories and files to determine if can have been trusted. For
   sendmail to run without complaining, you MUST execute the following
   command:
        chmod go-w / /etc /etc/mail /usr /var /var/spool /var/spool/mqueue
        chown root / /etc /etc/mail /usr /var /var/spool /var/spool/mqueue

   You will probably have to tweak this for your environment (for
   example, some systems put the spool directory into /usr/spool instead
   of /var/spool and use /etc/mail for aliases file instead of /etc). If
   you set the RunAsUser option in your sendmail.cf, the
   /var/spool/mqueue directory will have to be owned by the RunAsUser
   user. As a general rule, after you have compiled sendmail, run the
   command
        sendmail -v -bi

   to initialize the alias database. If it gives messages such as
        WARNING: writable directory /etc
        WARNING: writable directory /usr/spool/mqueue

   then the directories listed have inappropriate write permissions and
   should be secured to avoid various possible security attacks.

   Beginning with sendmail 8.9, these checks have become more strict to
   prevent users from being able to access files they would normally not
   be able to read. In particular, .forward and :include: files in unsafe
   directory paths (directory paths which are group or world writable)
   will no longer be allowed. This would mean that if user joe's home
   directory was writable by group staff, sendmail would not use his
   .forward file. This behavior can be altered, at the expense of system
   security, by setting the DontBlameSendmail option. For example, to
   allow .forward files in group writable directories:
        O DontBlameSendmail=forwardfileingroupwritabledirpath

   Or to allow them in both group and world writable directories:
        O DontBlameSendmail=forwardfileinunsafedirpath

   Items from these unsafe .forward and :include: files will be marked as
   unsafe addresses -- the items can not be deliveries to files or
   programs. This behavior can also be altered via DontBlameSendmail:
        O DontBlameSendmail=forwardfileinunsafedirpath,
                forwardfileinunsafedirpathsafe

   The first flag allows the .forward file to be read, the second allows
   the items in the file to be marked as safe for file and program
   delivery.

   Other files affected by this strengthened security include class files
   (i.e. Fw /etc/sendmail.cw), persistent host status files, and the
   files specified by the ErrorHeader and HelpFile options. Similar
   DontBlameSendmail flags are available for the class, ErrorHeader, and
   HelpFile files.

   If you have an unsafe configuration of .forward and :include: files,
   you can make it safe by finding all such files, and doing a "chmod
   go-w $FILE" on each. Also, do a "chmod go-w $DIR" for each directory
   in the file's path.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.34 -- What does "foo not available for sendmail programs" mean?

   Date: September 24, 1999

   It means that you are using smrsh, the sendmail restricted shell; see
   Q2.13 for details on this. To fix this problem, you need to create a
   sym-link from smrsh's directory for restricted programs to the program
   foo. The default location of this directory for restricted programs is
   /usr/adm/sm.bin in the Open Source version, but vendor versions
   differ. For example, RedHat Linux 6.0 uses /etc/smrsh, and Solaris 8
   uses /var/adm/sm.bin . If you don't know the directory for your OS,
   first check the smrsh man page, then if that fails, try:
        % strings /path/to/smrsh | grep ^/

   where /path/to/smrsh is the P= argument on the Mprog line in
   sendmail.cf .

   So for example:
        % cd /usr/adm/sm.bin
        % ln -s /usr/bin/vacation

   would allow the vacation program to be run from a user's .forward file
   or an alias which uses the "|program" syntax.

   Finally, if you want to disable use of smrsh, remove the
   FEATURE(`smrsh') line from the .mc file used to build sendmail.cf; see
   cf/README for details on this.

Q3.35 -- How do I add a footer/signature to all (outgoing) e-mail messages?

   Date: October 9, 2000
   Updated: August 1, 2001
   Updated: May 16, 2002
   Updated: February 22, 2003

   This is quite complicated. At first sight it might be simple: just
   "cat" some text (taken from a file or whatever) to the end of an
   e-mail message passing through sendmail. However, there is a big
   problem: what about structured e-mail messages, i.e., MIME messages?
   These can be arbitrarily complex and just "cat"ting a footer to the
   end of the body can break the MIME structure. (A MIME aware MUA will
   just not show such a footer, so it's pretty useless in any case.) But
   signed messages (think: PGP) will break. Another problem is the
   character set used by the mime part to which the disclaimer is added
   needs to match the actual character set of the disclaimer itself.
   Hence, there is no easy solution to this problem!

   If you know enough about MIME and some C programming, then take a look
   at sendmail 8.11 (or later) and libmilter/README. It now offers the
   functionality to achieve this goal.

   Some open source milters are capable of adding footers, e.g.
   MIMEDefang.

Q3.36 -- What does "Cannot open hash database ... Invalid argument" mean?

   Date: January 3, 2001
   Updated: February 8, 2001

   It's an error returned from the Berkeley DB library. It normally means
   that the db file was built with a different version of Berkeley DB
   than the one sendmail is currently using. You need to recompile
   makemap with the same version of Berkeley DB that sendmail was
   compiled with, and re-make your maps with that new version of makemap.

   From a typical Unix 'errno' man page:

    22 EINVAL Invalid argument. Some invalid argument was supplied.

   From the Berkeley DB 2.x 'db_open' man page (1.x 'dbopen' is similar):

EINVAL
      ...

      There is a mismatch between the version number of file and the
      software.

   Berkeley DB 3.x uses a special errno value for this - from its
   'db_open' man page:

DB_OLD_VERSION
      The database cannot be opened without being first upgraded.

   Unfortunately this isn't specifically handled by sendmail upto and
   including 8.11.2, resulting in an error message that says something
   like "Error -30990" instead of "Invalid argument".

   Here is a table mapping versions of Berkeley DB with the corresponding
   sendmail versions in which they are supported:

                        Berkeley DB          Sendmail
                   0.X - 1.4 (OLD_NEWDB)   8.1 - 8.8.8
                     1.5 and later 1.X    8.1 and later
                        2.0.0-2.6.3      8.9.0 and later
                    2.6.4 and later 2.X  8.9.2 and later
                     3.0 and later 3.X   8.10.0 and later
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.37 -- What does "parse error before `NDBM'" mean?

   Date: April 21, 2001

   This error is generally accompanied by a message indicating which file
   it occurred in, and which line number of that file, usually:
ERROR   NDBM or NEWDB must be defined.

   You are supposed to read that line, and do something about it.

   Normally, on Linux and the various BSDs, NEWDB is used, whereas on the
   "commercial" Unix variants (Solaris, HP-UX, possibly others), NDBM is
   used. Perhaps you failed to install the required libraries when you
   installed your system.

   Please refer to 3.31 and the Database Definitions section of our
   Compiling Sendmail web page for further details.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.38 -- What does "may be forged" mean?

   Date: November 12, 2001

   After sendmail does a hostname look-up on the IP address of the
   connecting client, the IP addresses of that hostname are looked up. If
   the client IP address does not appear in that list, then the may be
   forged tag is added.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.39 -- How do I send using an alternate port?

   Date: May 5, 2002
   Updated: January 10, 2004

   The port used for outgoing SMTP connections can be changed via the
   respective *_MAILER_ARGS macros for the various SMTP mailers. In a
   default configuration, sendmail uses either the relay mailer (for e.g.
   SMART_HOST when no mailer is specified) or the esmtp mailer (when
   sending directly to the MX of the recipient domain).

   So, if you want all outgoing SMTP connections to use port 2525, you
   can use this in your .mc file:
        define(`RELAY_MAILER_ARGS', `TCP $h 2525')
        define(`ESMTP_MAILER_ARGS', `TCP $h 2525')

   If you want to use an alternate port only for specific destinations,
   change (e.g.) only the RELAY_MAILER_ARGS, and make sure the relay
   mailer is not used for anything else. E.g. you can have sendmail use
   port 2525 only when sending to your domain with this in your .mc file:
        FEATURE(`mailertable')
        define(`confRELAY_MAILER', `esmtp')
        define(`RELAY_MAILER_ARGS', `TCP $h 2525')

   and then in your mailertable:
        yourdomain.com          relay:mail.yourdomain.com

   This will force sendmail to use port 2525 for connections to
   yourdomain.com. Of course, change 2525 to whatever alternate port
   number you wish to use.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.40 -- Why can't I use BerkeleyDB 4.1.x?

   Date: November 15, 2002
   Updated: December 29, 2002

   SleepyCat changed the API from Berkeley DB 4.0 to 4.1. Hence it is not
   supported in sendmail 8.12.6. Moreover, the semantics of the open()
   call have been changed, hence sendmail doesn't work with DB 4.1.x (x
   <= 24), even if the "obvious" API changes are made.

   However, with the release of Berkeley DB 4.1.25 and sendmail 8.12.7,
   things should work again with these versions (or greater, when the
   time comes).
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.41 -- How do I use CIDR notation in the access map (or other places)?

   Date: December 3, 2002

   Use contrib/cidrexpand to pre-process the data into a format that is
   supported by sendmail. For example:
cidrexpand < access | makemap hash access
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.42 -- Why isn't CIDR notation directly supported by sendmail?

   Date: December 3, 2002

   Because it is in general very expensive to do this. Here's an
   explanation from Per Hedeland:

     And not just more complex, it would have to do many more
     (comparatively expensive) lookups - there's no way, given (e.g.)
     the IP address 66.205.192.123, to find the matching
     "66.205.192.0/19" with a single lookup in a general key/value
     hashed map. The code would have to look for "66.205.192.123",
     "66.205.192.122/31", "66.205.192.120/30", "66.205.192.120/29", etc,
     etc - 14 lookups to find a /19, 32 to establish a non-match.

   which is 8 times more than the available octet boundary lookup.

     I haven't done any measurements, but I wouldn't be surprised if
     even in the absolute worst case, that your map is 128 times bigger
     than it "needs" to be, the time for a single lookup won't even
     double - i.e. you'll lose already on the second lookup.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.43 -- What does "Need to recompile with -DNEWDB for hash support" mean?

   Date: December 24, 2002

   See Q3.31. This is the newer form of the same error message, updated
   to be more informative and clueful. The actual line of code contains:
        "%s: Need to recompile with -D%s for %s support\n"

   where the first %s gets replaced by the name of the program (generally
   makemap), the second %s gets replaced by the name of the macro which
   needs to be defined (see the Database Definitions section of our
   Compiling Sendmail web page for the full list), and the third %s gets
   replaced by the argument to makemap which could not be handled.
     _________________________________________________________________

Q3.44 -- I disabled sendmail on some machines which don't receive mail, but
since upgrading to 8.12 they can't send mail either; why?

   Date: January 13, 2003
   Updated: October 19, 2005

   8.12 uses a new paradigm: the binary is no longer setuid-root; to make
   this work, there are now two queues, a "main" queue and a client-only
   queue. To match these, there are two config files: one for the main
   queue (sendmail.cf) and one for the client-only queue (submit.cf).
   There are also two sendmail processes which need to run: a daemon and
   a client queue runner. In the default configuration of sendmail, the
   client queue runner must be able to submit mail to the daemon on the
   local SMTP port. If the daemon is not listening on the SMTP port, the
   mail remains in the client-only queue. If you don't want to accept
   mail from other machines, you should add some or all of the following
   lines to your .mc file:
FEATURE(`no_default_msa')dnl
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`NAME=NoMTA4, Family=inet,  Addr=127.0.0.1')dnl
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Name=MSA4,   Family=inet,  Addr=127.0.0.1, Port=587, M=E')dnl
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`NAME=NoMTA6, Family=inet6, Addr=::1')dnl
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Name=MSA6,   Family=inet6, Addr=::1, Port=587, M=E')dnl

   Use the FEATURE line regardless, then if your machine has IPv4
   addresses configured, use the first two DAEMON_OPTIONS lines;
   likewise, use the second two DAEMON_OPTIONS lines if it has IPv6
   addresses configured, and all four if both types of addresses are
   configured. Then build a new .cf file from your .mc file, install it
   as /etc/mail/sendmail.cf and start sendmail.

   In some cases, however, it might be better instead to modify
   submit.mc, to use
FEATURE(`msp', `smart_host')dnl

   instead of the default
FEATURE(`msp', `[127.0.0.1]')dnl

   This has the advantage that you don't have to run a daemon on the
   local host, but a disadvantage of introducing a dependency on the
   smart_host machine. Which of the two solutions is better for you
   depends on whether or not your network architecture has such a
   smart_host, how reliable you deem that smart_host to be, and how
   inconvenient running a daemon locally would be.

Q4.1 -- Should I use a wildcard MX for my domain?

   Date: July 9, 1996
   Updated: November 5, 1997

   If at all possible, no.

   Wildcard MX records have lots of semantic "gotcha"s. For example, they
   will match a host "unknown.your.domain" -- if you don't explicitly
   test for unknown hosts in your domain, you will get "MX list for
   hostname points back to hostname" or "config error: mail loops back to
   myself".

   See RFCs 1535, 1536, and 1912 (updates RFC 1537) for more detail and
   other related (or common) problems. See also _DNS and BIND_ by Albitz
   and Liu.

   They can also cause your system to add your domain to outgoing FQDNs
   in a desperate attempt to get the mail to where it's supposed to go,
   but because *.your.domain is valid due to the wildcard MX, delivery to
   not.real.domain.your.domain will get dumped on you, and you may even
   find yourself in a loop as the domain keeps getting tacked on time
   after time after time (the "config error: mail loops back to myself"
   problem).

   Wildcard MX records are just a bad idea, plain and simple. They don't
   work the way you'd expect, and virtually no one gets them right. Avoid
   them at all costs.

Q4.2 -- How can I set up an auto-responder?

   Date: March 23, 1996
   Updated: February 16, 1999
   Updated: July 30, 2002

   This is a local mailer issue, not a sendmail issue. Depending on what
   you're doing, look at procmail (see Q4.9), ftpmail, Majordomo or of
   course vacation, which is part of the sendmail (8.10.0 and later)
   distribution.

   The latest version of Majordomo can be found at
   ftp://ftp.greatcircle.com/pub/majordomo/. It is written in Perl and
   requires either Perl 4.036, and appears to run with only minor tweaks
   under 5.001a or later. Make sure to check out the web interface for
   Majordomo called LWGate at
   http://www.netspace.org/users/dwb/lwgate.html. The latest versions of
   Perl (both 4.x and 5.x) can be found in
   http://www.metronet.com/perlinfo/src/. More information about Perl can
   be found at http://www.metronet.com/perlinfo/perl5.html

   The latest version of ftpmail can be found at

   archive (volume 37).

Subject: Q4.3 -- How can I get sendmail to deliver local mail to $HOME/.mail
instead of into /usr/spool/mail (or /usr/mail)?

   Date: July 9, 1996
   Updated: January 7, 1999

   Again, this is a local mailer issue, not a sendmail issue. Either
   modify your local mailer (source code will be required) or change the
   program called in the "local" mailer configuration description to be a
   new program that does this local delivery. One program that is capable
   of doing this is procmail (see Q4.9), although there are probably many
   others as well.
     _________________________________________________________________

Subject: Q4.4 -- Why does it deliver the mail interactively when I'm trying to
get it to go into queue only mode?

   Date: March 23, 1996
   Updated: August 14, 2000

   Or, I'm trying to use the "don't deliver to expensive mailer" flag,
   and it delivers the mail interactively anyway. I can see it does it:
   here's the output of "sendmail -v foo@somehost" (or Mail -v or
   equivalent).

   The -v flag to sendmail (which is implied by the -v flag to Mail and
   other programs in that family) tells sendmail to watch the
   transaction. Since you have explicitly asked to see what's going on,
   it assumes that you do not want to to auto-queue, and turns that
   feature off. Remove the -v flag and use a "tail -f" of the log instead
   to see what's going on.

   If you are trying to use the "don't deliver to expensive mailer" flag
   (mailer flag "e"), be sure you also turn on global option
   "HoldExpensive" (whose old one-character name was "c") -- otherwise it
   ignores the mailer flag.
     _________________________________________________________________

Subject: Q4.5 -- How can I solve "MX list for hostname points back to hostname"
and "config error: mail loops back to myself" messages?

   Date: January 17, 1997
   Updated: May 8, 2000
   Updated: January 24, 2002

   I'm getting these error messages:
        553 MX list for domain.net points back to relay.domain.net
        554 <user@domain.net>... Local configuration error

   How can I solve this problem?

   You have asked mail to a domain (e.g., domain.net) to be forwarded to
   a specific host (in this case, relay.domain.net) by using an MX
   record, but the relay machine doesn't recognize itself as domain.net.
   Add domain.net to /etc/mail/local-host-names [known as
   /etc/sendmail.cw prior to version 8.10] (if you are using
   FEATURE(`use_cw_file')) or add "Cw domain.net" to your configuration
   file.

   There are a couple of additional cases where you don't actually want
   local delivery, and thus adding domain.net to class w is not the right
   fix:
     * When relay.domain.net should just be acting as a forwarder, e.g. a
       firewall/gateway box. The proper fix could be to set up a
       mailertable entry for domain.net.
     * When relay.domain.net is a secondary (etc.) MX, and the MX
       mistakenly points to a CNAME or other "non-canonical" name [this
       gives "config error: mail loops back to me (MX problem?)"]. The
       proper fix is to point the MX at the actual name, a "work-around"
       to add the MX target to class w.

   IMPORTANT: When making changes to your configuration file, be sure you
   kill and restart the sendmail daemon (for any change in the
   configuration, not just this one):
        kill -HUP `head -1 /var/run/sendmail.pid`

   Note: You can also get this error message (MX loops ...) when two
   sendmail systems talk to each other, and both have the same value of
   $j . The best solution is "don't do that."

Subject: Q4.6 -- Why does my sendmail process sometimes hang when connecting
over a SLIP/PPP link?

   Date: March 23, 1996

   I'm connected to the network via a SLIP/PPP link. Sometimes my
   sendmail process hangs (although it looks like part of the message has
   been transfered). Everything else works. What's wrong?

   Most likely, the problem isn't sendmail at all, but the low level
   network connection. It's important that the MTU (Maximum Transfer
   Unit) for the SLIP connection be set properly at both ends. If they
   disagree, large packets will be trashed and the connection will hang.

   If you're interested in using these kinds of tools to help you do some
   near real-time monitoring of your system, you might be interested in
   MEWS (Mail Early Warning System). From the README:
        If you've ever written a perl script to parse sendmail
        log files looking for errors, MEWS might be of interest to
        you. If you've ever thought about writing a perl script to
        munge sendmail log files, cringed a little and hurriedly
        came up with an excuse not to do it, read on.

        If you don't have a Solaris 2.5 machine, you can probably
        stop reading here.

        The Mail Early Warning System (MEWS) gives postmasters
        immediate notification of trouble spots on your mail
        backbone. It only works with sendmail.

        To explain it in a nutshell, whenever sendmail returns a
        4xx or 5xx SMTP code, with the MEWS modifications, it also
        sends the code over UDP to a daemon which then replays the
        error message to interested parties.  The man pages go into
        a little bit more detail.

   If this sounds like something you might be interested in getting more
   details about, you can find the MEWS archive at

Subject: Q4.9 -- What is procmail, and where can I get it?

   Date: April 8, 1997
   Updated: February 28, 1999

   The program "procmail" is a replacement for the local mailer
   (variously called /bin/mail, /usr/bin/mail, mail.local, rmail,
   etc...). It has been ported to run on virtually every Unix-like OS
   you're likely to run into, and has a whole host of features. It is
   typically about 30% faster performing the job of the local mailer than
   programs such as /bin/mail or /usr/bin/mail, it has been hammered on
   widely to make it extremely secure (much more so than most local
   mailers) and very robust. Procmail is also capable of helping you put
   a quota on a user's mailbox through the standard Unix quota mechanism
   (see Q4.3).

   In short, whatever you've got, you're almost guaranteed that procmail
   is better (if nothing else, the author has been able to focus lots of
   time and energy into making it the best and fastest tool available,
   while most system vendors just throw something together as fast as
   they can and move on to the whole rest of the OS).

   However, this only begins to scratch the surface of what procmail is
   capable of. It's most important feature is the fact that it gives you
   a standard way to create rules (procmail calls them "recipes") to
   process your mail before the messages get put into your mailbox, and
   for that feature alone, it is one of the most important tools any
   administrator can have in their repertoire. By filtering out or
   automatically dealing with 80% of your daily cruft, it lets you spend
   more time on the hard 20%.

   Note that recent releases of version 8 sendmail natively support using
   procmail as an alternate local mailer (see "FEATURE(local_procmail)"
   for version 8.7 and above). They also support procmail as an
   additional local mailer, if you're concerned about flat-out replacing
   your current local mailer with procmail (see "MAILER(procmail)" in
   version 8.7 and above).

   You can also install procmail as a user and run it out of your
   .forward file, although this tends to be a bit slower and less
   efficient.

   More information about procmail can be found at
   http://www.procmail.org/ and the latest version can be found at
   ftp://ftp.procmail.org/pub/procmail/.

   Procmail is also the core to a mailing list management package called
   "SmartList", so if you've already got procmail, adding SmartList may
   be a good option. Some listowners prefer Majordomo, Listserv, or one
   of those other programs, but SmartList has more than a few adherents
   as well. Your personal tastes will dictate whether you swear by
   SmartList or at it.

Subject: Q4.10 -- How can I solve "cannot alias non-local names" errors?

   Date: March 24, 1997

   I upgraded from my vendor's sendmail to the latest version and now I'm
   getting these error messages when I run "newaliases":
/etc/aliases: line 13: MAILER-DAEMON... cannot alias non-local names
/etc/aliases: line 14: postmaster... cannot alias non-local names

   How can I solve this problem?

   Your local mailer doesn't have the "A" flag specified. Edit the Mlocal
   line in sendmail.cf and add "A" to the flags listed after "F=".

   Better yet, if you're running a recent version of sendmail that uses
   m4 to generate .cf files from .mc files, regenerate your sendmail.cf
   and see if that fixes the problem. Remember to install the new
   sendmail.cf and restart the sendmail daemon.

Subject: Q4.12 -- How can I batch remote mail to be sent using my ISP while
delivering local mail immediately?

   Date: October 14, 1997
   Updated: February 9, 1999
   Updated: May 19, 2004

   First, you need to get sendmail not to use DNS on your local machine
   so your host doesn't trying to connect to your ISP for a DNS query.
   See Q3.22 for more information.

   You also need to designate a "smart host" or external relay to handle
   all mail that you can't deliver locally (this would be your ISP's
   mailhost).

   You need to configure it so that the smtp mailer is considered
   "expensive" by adding the F=e mailer flag and tell sendmail not to
   connect to expensive mailers by default by setting the HoldExpensive
   option to True.

   You need to add mydomain.com to the sendmail.cw file or the Cw line in
   the sendmail.cf. See Q4.5.

   Finally, you need to run a program periodically to check in with your
   ISP and get them to deliver any mail they may have queued for you. See
   Q3.23.

   Andrzej Filip offers a different solution based on use of the dsmtp
   mailer (introduced in 8.10) instead of expensive mailers.
     _________________________________________________________________

Subject: Q4.13 -- What does "unknown mailer error 1" mean?

   Date: September 24, 1998

   In general, sendmail does not perform final delivery of messages, but
   relies on a local delivery agent instead. Such an agent, mail.local,
   is provided with the sendmail distribution. Any such agent that
   sendmail invokes for message delivery, as specified on an M line in
   sendmail.cf, must exit with code 0 (success), or one of the failure
   codes noted in src/sysexits.h. These generally run in the range 64 -
   78, so 1 would be out of range, and lead to sendmail generating the
   above error.

Subject: Q4.14 -- How do I queue mail for another domain?

   Date: April 28, 1999
   Updated: December 21, 2000
   Updated: May 19, 2004

   Situation: Your system mailserver.my.domain should act as a backup
   mailserver for mailserver.destination.domain. The client wants to
   receive mail for the address user@destination.domain. This requires:
    1. MX Records:
destination.domain.             IN MX 10 mailserver.destination.domain.
destination.domain.             IN MX 20 mailserver.my.domain.
mailserver.destination.domain.  IN MX 10 mailserver.destination.domain.
mailserver.destination.domain.  IN MX 20 mailserver.my.domain.
       The last two records are there "just in case" (someone forgot
       masquerading).
       Make sure you use the real names of all systems.
       mailserver.my.domain must know its own name, otherwise you'll get
       the famous mail loops back to myself error.
       Instead of using MX records that point to
       mailserver.destination.domain, you can use the
       FEATURE(mailertable) on mailserver.my.domain as explained in
       cf/README for routing e-mails.
    2. On your system: do nothing unless you have anti-relay rules
       installed (which you really should have!). In this case, add
       destination.domain to the required files (8.9) (or for 8.8). Don't
       add destination.domain or mailserver.destination.domain to class w
       on your system!
       If you want finer-grained control, then instead of updating
       /etc/mail/relay-domains, add the following to /etc/mail/access, as
       the access map entries allows relaying only "To:" a domain, while
       relay-domains allows both directions.
To:destination.domain   RELAY
    3. sendmail on your system will try to deliver mail during queue
       runs, however, the client may trigger delivery by using the ETRN
       command.
     _________________________________________________________________

Subject: Q4.15 -- How do I create attachments with sendmail?

   Date: May 26, 1999

   You don't. Sendmail is a mail transfer agent (MTA). Creating e-mail
   messages, including adding attachments or signatures, is the function
   of a mail user agent (MUA). Some popular MUAs include mutt, elm, exmh,
   Netscape, Eudora and Pine. Some specialized packages (metamail, some
   Perl modules, etc.) can also be used to create messages with
   attachments.
     _________________________________________________________________

Subject: Q4.16 -- How do I find sendmail's version number?

   Date: August 2, 1999
   Updated: July 19, 2000
   Updated: December 28, 2001

   To find out which version is actually running, from without, telnet to
   the SMTP port (port 25). The daemon usually announces its name and
   version number, as in
thishost% telnet that.host 25
Trying IP_addr...
Connected to that.host.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 that.host ESMTP Sendmail 8.12.1/8.12.1; Fri, 28 Dec 2001 11:39:34 -0800
QUIT

   To query a binary on your local host, the following command should
   display its version number, along with some extra configuration
   information, possibly including the configuration version number:
% echo \$Z | /usr/sbin/sendmail -bt -d0
Version 8.12.1
 Compiled with: MAP_REGEX LOG MATCHGECOS MIME7TO8 MIME8TO7 NAMED_BIND
                NETINET NETUNIX NEWDB NIS QUEUE SCANF SMTP USERDB XDEBUG

============ SYSTEM IDENTITY (after readcf) ============
      (short domain name) $w = knecht
  (canonical domain name) $j = knecht.Sendmail.ORG
         (subdomain name) $m = Sendmail.ORG
              (node name) $k = knecht.Sendmail.ORG
========================================================

ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
Enter <ruleset> <address>

   Adjust the pathname as needed; /usr/lib and /usr/sbin are the most
   common locations.

Subject: Q4.17 -- How do I handle user names with upper-case characters?

   Date: November 18, 1999
   Updated: August 8, 2001

   You really shouldn't, because upper case characters in user names are
   contrary to the Unix tradition. If you do, then e-mail addresses will
   be case sensitive, so that mail to <USER@your.host> will bounce
   instead of being delivered to <user@your.host>. As this is contrary to
   the expectations of many, it is not recommended.

   But if you insist on doing so anyway, and you have version 8.10, put
   the following in your .mc file:
MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+u')dnl

   If you don't have 8.10, you will need to redefine the
   LOCAL_MAILER_FLAGS m4 variable, but the initial value varies from OS
   to OS, so this is yet another reason not to mess with this flag.

   Another hack is the creation of aliases for Uppercase local users in
   the form:
# lowercase version to real one
uppercase: Uppercase

   It will make sendmail deliver messages to uppercase local recipients
   in a case insensitive manner.

Subject: Q4.18 -- What does "NOQUEUE: Null connection from ..." mean?

   Date: February 24, 2000
   Updated: March 12, 2000

   An entry like:
NOQUEUE: Null connection from host.domain [IP.AD.DD.RESS]

   in the logfile means that host.domain connected to your MTA but
   neither initiated transmission of a message (by issuing the MAIL
   command), nor used any of the commands that are logged separately
   (EXPN/VRFY/ETRN). Unless this happens very often, you can ignore this.
   If it happens very often, it's either someone playing around or it's a
   network problem.

   Note 1: The significant part of the message isn't the NOQUEUE, but the
   "Null connection from ...". In particular, NOQUEUE isn't an error
   indication, but just a "place-holder" when no queue ID has been
   assigned, typically because message collection hasn't started (yet).
   It can occur in other messages too, and there too the significant part
   is what comes after the NOQUEUE.

   Note 2: In 8.10, the text which led to the confusion has been changed
   to: "... did not issue MAIL/EXPN/VRFY/ETRN during connection to ...".
     _________________________________________________________________

Subject: Q4.19 -- How do I configure sendmail for POP/IMAP/... ?

   Date: March 12, 2000

   You don't. Sendmail is a mail transfer agent whose primary purpose is
   to send and receive e-mail (primarily via SMTP). Sendmail does not
   implement any remote access protocols such as POP or IMAP. But if you
   want to learn more about these and other (non-sendmail) e-mail related
   things, please refer to our Other (Non-Sendmail) E-Mail Related Links

   It would require custom programming. You could either write a mail
   filter using the new Milter API in sendmail 8.10 and later (see
   libmilter/README) or you could look at some of these other unsupported
   hints:
     * Axel Reinhold's logall.c module
     * Message-Id: <33AA593A.4B701C3F@syntegra.nl>
     * the procmailrc man page

   Note that no such feature has been added to sendmail. When asked about
   this one of the sendmail developers said it was "because we still
   believe a bit in privacy."

Subject: Q4.21 -- How can I send mail to all users?

   Date: December 12, 2000

   There is no magic short-cut for this. But it is not hard to set up:
   create an aliases entry
alluser:        :include:/etc/mail/allusers

   Don't forget to run 'newaliases'. Then list your users, one per line,
   in the file '/etc/mail/allusers'. You might be able to do that with
        awk -F: '$3 > 100 { print $1 }' /etc/passwd > /etc/mail/allusers

Subject: Q4.22 -- Why can't I receive external mail?

   Date: December 4, 2002
   Updated: August 16, 2004

   Several vendors have changed the way that sendmail is run. They
   decided that most people need a client-only version of sendmail. So it
   is listening only on the localhost interface. Check the system
   documentation on how to change your .mc file. Here is a partial table
   of where some vendors ship their sendmail configuration hierarchy:

   But you should check for yourself on your own system. When in doubt,
   do a find for "proto.m4", then go up the tree one level. When you find
   the .mc file, look for the string "DAEMON_OPTIONS" and for the comment
   lines near that string.

   See also 5.3.1.3 for discussion about this problem as it relates
   specifically to Red Hat 7.1 and later.

Subject: Q4.23 -- How do I restrict attachments with sendmail?

   Date: May 19, 2004

   sendmail itself does not look at the content of a message, so it is
   not in a position to strip attachments. You need a filtering package
   that works with sendmail. You might want to look at www.milter.org for
   some open source solutions that use our "milter" facility. There's
   also something called MIMEDefang that can do it. You can also get
   commercial products to do it (see www.sendmail.com for example).

Subject: Q4.24 -- Can I get sendmail to verify an entire e-mail address instead
of just the domain?

   Date: May 19, 2004

   If the e-mail comes from example.com, you have to look up the MX or A
   records for example.com to figure out which mail server to ask if the
   user is valid. The DNS could be slow or unresponsive. The remote
   server could be slow or unresponsive.

   If you were to make such checks, a bad guy could bombard you with mail
   claiming to come from hotmail.com users, and then suddenly you would
   be connection-bombing Hotmail's mail servers asking them about the
   recipients the bad guy is claiming to be.

   The only safe way to do this is to verify that the sender exists when
   the sender claims to be in your domain. Naturally you are then in a
   position to confirm or deny the sender is valid.

  Q5.1.1 -- How can I solve "line 273: replacement $3 out of bounds" errors?

   Date: March 23, 1996

   When I use sendmail V8 with a Sun config file I get lines like:
        /etc/sendmail.cf: line 273: replacement $3 out of bounds

   the line in question reads:
        R$*<@$%y>$*             $1<@$2.LOCAL>$3                 user@ether

   what does this mean? How do I fix it?

   V8 doesn't recognize the Sun "$%y" syntax, so as far as it is
   concerned, there is only a $1 and a $2 (but no $3) in this line. Read
   Rick McCarty's paper on "Converting Standard Sun Config Files to
   Sendmail Version 8", in the contrib directory (file
   "converting.sun.configs") in the latest version 8 sendmail
   distribution for a full discussion of how to do this.
     _________________________________________________________________

  Q5.1.2 -- How can I solve "line 445: bad ruleset 96 (50 max)" errors?

   Date: March 23, 1996

   When I use sendmail V8 on a Sun, I sometimes get lines like:
        /etc/sendmail.cf: line 445: bad ruleset 96 (50 max)

   what does this mean? How do I fix it?

   You're somehow trying to start up the old Sun sendmail (or
   sendmail.mx) with a version 8 sendmail config file, which Sun's
   sendmail doesn't like. Check your /etc/rc.local, any procedures that
   have been created to stop and re-start the sendmail processes, etc....
   Make sure that you've switched everything over to using the new
   sendmail. To keep this problem from ever happening again, try the
   following (make sure you're logged in as root):
        mv /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail.old
        ln -s /usr/local/lib/sendmail.v8 /usr/lib/sendmail
        mv /usr/lib/sendmail.mx /usr/lib/sendmail.mx.old
        ln -s /usr/local/lib/sendmail.v8 /usr/lib/sendmail.mx
        chmod 0000 /usr/lib/sendmail.old
        chmod 0000 /usr/lib/sendmail.mx.old

   Assuming, of course, that you have installed sendmail V8 in
   /usr/local/lib/sendmail.v8.
     _________________________________________________________________

  Q5.1.3 -- Why does version 8 sendmail (< 8.7.5) sometimes hang under Solaris
  2.5?

   Date: May 23, 1996

   In moving from Solaris 2.4 to Solaris 2.5, the kernel changed its name
   and is now in /kernel/genunix instead of /kernel/unix, so _PATH_UNIX
   in conf.h is pointing to the wrong place.

   If you can't upgrade to the latest release of sendmail 8.8.z, the next
   best thing to do is change _PATH_UNIX in conf.h (in the solaris2 part)
   to point to the generic interface /dev/ksyms, like so:
        #   define _PATH_UNIX      "/dev/ksyms"
     _________________________________________________________________

  Q5.1.4 -- Why can't I use SunOS/Solaris to get email to certain large sites?

   Date: November 24, 1996

   This is most likely a problem in your resolver libraries (DNS,
   /etc/hosts, NIS, etc...). Older Sun (and Solaris?) resolver libraries
   allocated enough room for only five IP addresses for each host name,
   and if any program ever ran across a name with more than five IP
   addresses for it, the program would crash.

   For example, this would keep you from getting mail to CompuServe,
   since (at the time of this writing) they list eleven IP addresses for
   mx1.compuserve.com (one of the named MXes for compuserve.com).

   This will affect you even if you use version 8 sendmail, since it's a
   problem in the resolver libraries, and not in sendmail itself.

   You should either get patches to the resolver libraries from Sun, or
   the latest version of BIND (see Q2.12) and install their resolver
   library routines. Between the two, installing BIND is a bit more work,
   but it typically gives you much more up-to-date code to help you
   resist attacks to your systems, more capable programs to be used for
   serving the DNS (including support for IPv6 and several other
   features), and some very useful utility programs.
     _________________________________________________________________

  Q5.1.5 -- Why do I have trouble compiling on Solaris?

   Date: October 20, 1997

   Many people have experienced compilation problems on Solaris, with the
   compiler typically complaining about tm_zone or TopFrame. The Solaris
   section of our Compiling Sendmail page explains these.
     _________________________________________________________________

  Q5.1.6 -- How does 8.X compare to 8.X+Sun?

   Date: August 29, 1998

   With a Vn/Berkeley config file, they're identical. There are a few
   minor differences between 8.X with a Vn/Berkeley config file and
   8.X+Sun with the same config file, but the V line changed to Vn/Sun.
   But most differences are the backwards compatibility hacks needed for
   8.X+Sun to support old V1/Sun config files.

   There are three web pages which discuss these in detail: Berkeley
   migration (from SMI-8.6 to 8.X), Sun migration (from SMI-8.6 to
   8.X+Sun), and Differences (5 sections comparing and contrasting config
   files and binaries).

  Q5.2.1 -- The system resource controller always reports sendmail as
  "inoperative". What's wrong?

   Date: July 5, 1996
   Updated: January 30, 2002

   When I use version 8 sendmail on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX, the
   system resource controller always reports sendmail as "inoperative",
   even though it's actually running. What's wrong?

   When running as a daemon, sendmail detaches from its parent process,
   fooling the SRC into thinking that sendmail has exited. To fix this,
   issue the commands:
        kill `head -1 /etc/sendmail.pid`
        chssys -s sendmail -f 9 -n 15 -S -a "-bD"
        startsrc -s sendmail -a "-bd -q30m"
            # your sendmail args may vary

   Now the SRC should report the correct status of sendmail.

   For more information, read up on the System Resource Controller, the
   lssrc command and the chssys command in the online AIX documentation.
     _________________________________________________________________

  Q5.2.2 -- Why can't I use AIX to get email to some sites?

   Date: April 8, 1997

   When I use IBM's sendmail on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX trying to get
   to certain sites, it seems that I can get to some of them and not
   others. What's wrong?

   There are two possible problems here:

   1) Your version of sendmail is not configured to recognize MX records
   in the DNS. Search through your sendmail.cf looking for "OK MX" or "OK
   ALL". Older configurations had this line commented out, and this will
   cause mail from you to some sites to fail (because those sites have MX
   records, but no A records in their DNS for the specific Fully
   Qualified Domain Name you're trying to mail to).

   For more information, see the comp.unix.aix FAQ
   ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/aix-faq/.

   2) There is a negative caching bug in AIX 3.2.5 with /usr/sbin/named
   executables that are less than 103000 bytes long. Ask your IBM
   representative to give you PMP 3251, or the most recent patch that
   fixes this problem for your particular configuration and version of
   the OS.
     _________________________________________________________________

  Q5.2.3 -- Why can't I get sendmail 8.7.1 to use MX records with AIX 3.2.5?

   Date: July 5, 1996

   IBM, in their infinite wisdom, provided a header file that would
   easily mis-compile. This resulted in the struct{} for the DNS query to
   be mis-allocated, and MX processing would barf.

   Fix 1) upgrade to 8.7.5 - this has a code fix for this problem.

   Fix 2) Install the BIND 4.9.4 libraries and include files and tweak
   the Makefile.AIX to use them - I *think* these Get It Right (if not,
   at least it'll die during compile rather than failing weirdly at
   runtime).

   Fix 3) Hack Makefile.AIX to pass a -DBIT_ZERO_ON_LEFT to cause the
   headers to use the right #ifdefs.

    5.3.1.1 -- Why do I have so many sendmail problems after configuring
    sendmail with linuxconf?

   Date: June 15, 2000
   Updated: September 27, 2000

   Do not edit sendmail.cf with linuxconf. This tool and its module
   "mailconf" are broken and based on very old rulesets from 8.8.7 . You
   will have many troubles if you do this. First make sure that the
   sendmail-cf RPM is installed. Then create your own myhost.mc file in
   /usr/lib/sendmail-cf/cf:
        % cd /usr/lib/sendmail-cf/cf
        % cp redhat.mc myhost.mc
        (Edit myhost.mc)
        % m4 ../m4/cf.m4 myhost.mc > myhost.cf
        (Test this new myhost.cf; once it's known good, install it:)
        (If 8.9.x or earlier:)
                % cp myhost.cf /etc/sendmail.cf
                % chown root /etc/sendmail.cf
        (If 8.10.x or later:)
                % cp myhost.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
                % chown root /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

   See /usr/doc/sendmail/README.cf (or just README) for features and
   detailed instructions how to do this.
     _________________________________________________________________

    5.3.1.2 -- I built sendmail.cf from sendmail.mc and it works until the next
    reboot of the machine. What is going on?

   Date: June 15, 2000

   If you have used linuxconf's module "mailconf" just once, it will
   rewrite your sendmail.cf on every reboot if it sees that sendmail.cf
   is changed from linuxconf. The solution is to remove the mailconf
   module from linuxconf. Turn on linuxconf and go to item
        Control files and systems > Configure Linuxconf modules

   Scroll down to "Module path -> mailconf" and turn off the button "this
   module is active", then click "Accept" and "quit" to quit linuxconf.

   This will disable linuxconf's control of sendmail. Build sendmail.cf
   again from sendmail.mc (see 5.3.1), and restart sendmail.
     _________________________________________________________________

    5.3.1.3 -- Why can't I receive mail with Red Hat 7.1 and later?

   Date: May 3, 2001
   Updated: June 11, 2001
   Updated: December 4, 2002

   Red Hat, like some other vendors, changed the way that sendmail is
   run. (See 4.22 for a more general discussion of this problem.) They
   decided that most people need a client-only version of sendmail. So it
   is listening only on the localhost interface. Check the RH
   documentation on how to change that:

   Make sure that you have installed the "sendmail-cf" package on your
   system -- it should be on your install media.

   Then check the file "sendmail.mc" (probably in "/etc/mail"). Look for
   the string "DAEMON_OPTIONS" and for the comment lines near that
   string.

   Also note that Red Hat 7.1 and later build sendmail with tcpwrapper
   support, and provide a hosts.deny file that rejects all external mail.
   The sendmail:ALL addition to hosts.allow fixes this.
     _________________________________________________________________

  5.3.2 -- SuSE
     _________________________________________________________________

    5.3.2.1 -- Where is the sendmail.mc file on SuSE Linux?

   Date: May 5, 2002

   On SuSE Linux systems there is no real sendmail.mc file. This file is
   generated 'on the fly' by SuSEconfig using several variables in
   /etc/rc.config and /etc/rc.config.d/sendmail.rc.config (SuSE <= 7.3)
   or /etc/sysconfig/sendmail (SuSE >= 8.0).

   SuSEconfig executes the script /sbin/conf.d/SuSEconfig.sendmail to a)
   build a temorary .mc file b) execute m4 to generate /etc/sendmail.cf
   and c) delete the temporary .mc file afterwards.

   To make customisations you cannot achieve by modifying the variables
   in the configuration files mentioned above (using YaST or YaST2), you
   have two options:
    1. Use /etc/mail/linux.mc (or /etc/mail/linux.nullclient.mc) as a
       starting point. Both files contain several helpful comments.
    2. To get a .mc file based on your current configuration, modify
       /sbin/conf.d/SuSEconfig.sendmail to keep the temporary .mc file
       and execute SuSEconfig afterwards. Then use that copy as starting
       point.

   In both cases you have to build your /etc/sendmail.cf (note: SuSE
   still uses /etc not /etc/mail as suggested in the manual) using the m4
   macroprocessor:
m4 your.mc.file > /etc/sendmail.cf

   Then reload sendmail with "rcsendmail reload".

   To prevent SuSEconfig from overiding your new sendmail.cf in future
   runs, set the variable "SENDMAIL_TYPE" in
   /etc/rc.config.d/sendmail.rc.config to "no" (SuSE Linux <= 7.3). On
   systems >= 8.0 you probably will have to set an "exit" command atop of
   the file /sbin/conf.d/SuSEconfig.sendmail to do the same. SuSE 8.0
   does not know the SENDMAIL_TYPE variable.

Q6 -- Additional information sources

   This probably isn't in strict RFC 1807 format, but I'm getting closer.
   Unfortunately, the format detailed in RFC 1807 was never intended to
   be used in this fashion, so I'm doing a bit of square-peg fitting into
   round holes.

   Note that the publisher ids that I've assigned should not be
   misconstrued to imply that I have actually published all these
   documents, it's just that I need some sort of reasonable entry for the
   RFC 1807 "ID" field, and in lieu of information to the contrary
   indicating what the actual publishers have registered, I have assigned
   my own, independent, "third-party" IDs. Hopefully, the bibliographic
   entries below make it obvious who the real publishers of the various
   documents are.

   ABSTRACT::

   Centers more on IDA sendmail (at least partly because version 8 didn't
   exist when they began the book). Written more like a college Sophomore
   or Junior level textbook.

   While you'll probably never let the Costales book out of your grubby
   little hands (especially if you do much work with version 8 sendmail),
   this is a book you'll probably read once or maybe twice, learn some
   very valuable things, but then likely put on a shelf and not read or
   reference again (unless you have to write up a bibliographic entry for
   it). Makes a better introduction to sendmail for management types,
   especially if you don't want them getting their hands on too much
   "dangerous" technical information. Also a *lot* smaller and less
   imposing.

   If possible, I recommend getting both, but if you can only get one,
   get Costales unless you're going to be working exclusively with IDA
   sendmail, in which case Avolio & Vixie will probably be more useful.

   Note that Paul Vixie is extremely busy working on further development
   of BIND, the Internet de facto standard program for serving the DNS,
   upon which all Internet services depend, mail being only one of them.
   Like Eric and Bryan, he's also very busy. Unless you're willing to
   compensate him for his services, please let him get real work done.

   ABSTRACT::

   This book is useful whether you run Linux or some other Unix version.
   It attempts to simplify sendmail by covering only configuration
   options usually needed, which reduces some complexity for new sendmail
   administrators. Covered are: using the m4 language to build a sendmail
   configuration, using sendmail databases such as access maps, testing
   and debugging and using sendmail authentication techniques. Covers
   some things not in the Costales book (the "Bat Book") which was last
   updated for sendmail 8.8.

   ABSTRACT::

   As email traffic continues to increase, system administrators must be
   able to guarantee that their email servers can deliver reliable
   performance today and bear larger loads tomorrow. "sendmail
   Performance Tuning" is a practical guide to building, tuning, and
   testing email servers based on sendmail to function more efficiently,
   handle more messages, and resist both accidental and malicious
   load-related incidents.

   ABSTRACT::

   Still the best hands-on Unix System Administration book around. Covers
   far more than just sendmail, but the sixty-four pages (pages 455-518
   in the third printing) it does devote are very well written and quite
   useful. Also provides a version of Rob Kolstad's checksendmail script
   on the accompanying CD-ROM.

   Note that Eric Allman and Marshall Kirk McKusick wrote the Foreword
   for the Second Edition. This should give you at least an inkling as to
   how essential this book is, even for experienced Unix administrators.

   ABSTRACT::

   Devotes 50 pages (most of chapter 8) to discussion of sendmail. As far
   as TCP/IP networking books go that also happen to discuss sendmail, it
   seems well-written and clear (better than I recall Hunt's book being),
   but rather dated in the face of books devoted to the topic and all the
   recent development activity in the sendmail community. Forget about
   the references, though. The newest sendmail-related reference listed
   is dated 1983, ten years before the date on this book and most
   certainly wildly out-of-date now.

   There are other books written on the subject of Internetworking with
   TCP/IP (most notably Comer), but this particular book seems to have a
   unique mix of theory (if perhaps a bit dated) and practical advice.
   Other books tend to have lots of one or the other, or split their
   theory and nitty-gritty details into separate books in a series (like
   Comer).

   Assuming that an update will be coming out soon, it probably deserves
   a place on the shelf of most System or Network Administrators, right
   next to _Internetworking with TCP/IP_ by Comer, _Managing Internet
   Information Services_ by Liu, et. al., _DNS and BIND_ by Albitz and
   Liu, _Unix System Administration_ by Nemeth, et. al., and last, but
   certainly not least, _sendmail_ by Costales. However, it deserves this
   place more because of the non-sendmail related material, as opposed to
   what sendmail-related material there is.

   ABSTRACT::

   Chapter 10 consists of 50 pages devoted to sendmail. Appendix E is a
   60 page sendmail reference which covers compiling sendmail, m4
   compiler options, sendmail command line arguments, and sendmail
   configuration. A very good treatment of sendmail, less daunting and
   more current than the 2nd edition Costales book. The introductary
   chapters of the book are also helpful in understanding the big picture
   of network services.

   ABSTRACT::

   As definitive as Costales is on sendmail, this book is on the subject
   of the Domain Name System (DNS) and the most common server software
   for the DNS, namely BIND.

   The third edition deals with the new 8.1.2 version of BIND as well as
   the older 4.9 versions. Wherever there is a difference in behavior of
   the versions, the book points out which version does what. Anyone
   still using the first edition should strongly consider replacing it
   now since the new features will be the basis for the next generation
   of name servers.

   Since the sending of Internet mail is so very heavily dependent on the
   DNS, it obviously also belongs on the shelf of any Postmaster or
   System Administrator whose site does Internet email. That means
   virtually every administrator of every site on the Internet.

   ABSTRACT::

   Replaces _Managing UUCP and Usenet_ by Todino and O'Reilly as the
   definitive book for using, installing, and managing UUCP.

   The general assumption with version 8 sendmail is that virtually no
   one uses UUCP to send email anymore, but if that assumption isn't true
   for you, then you probably need this book.

OTHER_ACCESS::  URL:http://www.dejanews.com
    LANGUAGE::  English
       NOTES::  Archives/indexes only Usenet news.

   ABSTRACT::

   The first, and still most focussed, Usenet news archive/index site.
   Others archive/index news as well as other things, but none that I've
   seen do it better.

   Go to "Power Search" then "Query Filter" if you wish to restrict the
   newsgroups you search on to something like just comp.mail.sendmail and
   not all newsgroups.

   ABSTRACT::

   One of the leading indexes of world-wide web pages, and their
   archive/index of Usenet news is obviously secondary.

   ABSTRACT::

   Google has acquired DejaNews. This is the search tool for news
   archive. It works very well and you can see a whole thread in one web
   screen which makes it quick and easy to read responses which follow
   any question.

   sendmail.org 7. THANKS!

   Special thanks to:

   Eric Allman The core of the material here comes from his FAQ for
   version 8.6.9 sendmail. I couldn't even have gotten started were it
   not for him. And if he hadn't written sendmail, there obviously
   wouldn't even be a FAQ. Heck, there might not even be an Internet.
   Paul Southworth Provides FAQ posting services, useful comments on
   various sections, and the mailclient-faq. I couldn't have kept doing
   this were it not for his help.
   Ed Ravin Virtually all the material regarding the use of sendmail on
   AIX is his, and most of it has been carried over verbatim.

   Thanks also to:

   Neil Hoggarth, Andras Salamon, Johan Svensson, Christopher X.
   Candreva, Bill Wohler, Matthew Wall, Henry W. Farkas, Claus Assmann,
   Curt Sampson, Rebecca Lasher, Jim Davis, David Keegel, Betty Lee,
   Alain Durand, Walter Schweizer, Christophe Wolfhugel, Al Gilman,
   Valdis Kletnieks, John Gardiner Myers, Paul DuBois, Adam Bentley, Dave
   Sill, Dave Wreski, Paul Caloca, Eamonn Coleman, Michael Fuhr, Betty
   Lee, Derrell Lipman, Era Eriksson, Richard Troxel, and the readers and
   posters of comp.mail.sendmail.
