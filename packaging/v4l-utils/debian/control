Description: Collection of video4linux support libraries
 libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 .
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 .
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

Description: Collection of command line video4linux utilities
 v4l-utils contains the following video4linux command line utilities:
 .
  decode_tm6000: decodes tm6000 proprietary format streams
  v4l2-compliance: tool to test v4l2 API compliance of drivers
  v4l2-ctl, cx18-ctl, ivtv-ctl: tools to control v4l2 controls from the cmdline

Description: Collection of command line DVB utilities
 This is a series of tools written to help testing and working with DVB,
 using its latest V5 API. The tools can also work with the DVBv3 API.
 .
 The current tools are:
 .
 dvb-fe-tool: a simple test application, that reads from the frontend.
 it also allows one to change the default delivery system.
 In the future, it may be used to change any property via command line.
 .
 dvb-format-convert: converts from zap and scan initial-tuning-data-file
 into the new format defined to work with DVBv5.
 .
 dvbv5-scan: a DVBv5 scan tool.
 .
 dvbv5-zap: a DVBv5 zap tool. It allow to tune into a DVB channel, and
 to watch to a DVB service (e. g. receiving the video and audio
 streams, via another application using the dvr device).

Description: Alter keymaps of Remote Controller devices
 This package allows one to change the keymap of controller receivers.
 Those receivers are found as infrared receivers on DVB sticks or on
 framegrabber cards. Via ir-keytable the mapping from a scancode to
 the generated event can be customized and made persistent.
