    warnings.

dnprogs (2.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't check_kernel when building DEBS so
    autobuilders can build it. Instead default to kernel 2.4.x
    Previously I had done this manually but I often forgot, this

  * Some bugfixes in librms

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@pandh.demon.co.uk>  Mon,  3 Apr 2000 19:33:06 +0000

dnprogs (2.04-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Fixed random crash in FAL when creating multiple files
  * Fixed a memory leak in dncopy sending multiple files
  * Fixed compilation on Slackware; I love linux having millions of distros :-(
  * Made startnet give out more friendly messages
  * dncopy now consults the DNCOPY_OPTIONS environment variable for default
    command-line arguments.
  * Added RFA file access to FAL - this is more useful than it sounds, honest.
  * Added support for files with variable length records (non-stream) to FAL.
    This needs metadata (-m) enabled.
  * Fixed bug in fal where OOB ACCOMP messages never got a response. This was
    most obvious when editting a large file via EDT and quitting near the top.
  * Removed dncopy.README as it didn't say anything anyway
  * Include a modified dnping with all sorts of new features, submitted by
    Rob Davies. man page by me.

    Linux too.

 -- Patrick Caulfield <patrick@pandh.demon.co.uk>  Sat,  5 Feb 2000 19:33:06 +0000

dnprogs (2.03-1) stable; urgency=low

  * RPMs now include the decnetconf script.
  * RPMs now include some previously missing man pages
  * Corrected dndir so that it works with DECnet/E.
    Thanks to Paul Koning <pkoning@xedia.com> for the patch. I've reworked it
    a bit so if it doesn't work blame me and not him.
    fal still needs a fair bit of work.
  * Asking for a directory of an empty filespec shows the user's home directory
  * Fixed startup scripts so that startnet really doesn't run on a 2.3 "Steve"
     kernel.
  * Zeroed out some sockaddr_dn structures for fussier 2.3 kernels.
  * Fixed compilation with gcc 2.95.2 (Debian potato)
  * Added prototype to dnet_conn into dnetdb.h
  * Made phoned a bit more robust to junk coming in on its socket.
  * Fixed static linking. Now use the local libs rather than the installed ones
     and also made it an all-or-nothing option.
  * Fixed dialling in phoned so that it bleeps at the user again.
  * ctermd no longer uses 'login -p'
  * Fixed the DAP client buffer size from 65536 to 65535. D'oh! Only my FAL
    barfed on this piece of (probably alcohol induced) stupidity; and it
    shouldn't have.
  * In FAL dir node::"/dir" now adds a "/*" to the end of the name so you get
    a directory listing.
  * Fal doesn't add version numbers to files that already have them (eg. files
    created by the VMS NFS client)
  * Fixed mirror in dnetd.
  * Fixed mirror example code in man page for dnet_daemon.
  * Fixed TYPEing files from VMS broken by blocking in 2.01.
  * Fixed manpage symlinks for dnet_getnode and dnet_nextnode.
  * Phone client now works with 2.3 kernels.
  * ctermd & dnetd use Unix98 ptys if available.
  * Prevent phone client from dialling itself because it causes a dealock
    with the server. I know this is only fixing the symptom but talking to
    yourself is bad for you anyway!
  * Some documentation updates and man page tidying.
  * Added -p option to dnetd to specify an alternative directory to look
    for program binaries.
  * startnet now works on 'Steve' kernels. It uses the sysctl interface to
    configure the system from the information in /etc/decnet.conf. You don't
    really need this (and the startup script still doesn't call it) but it
    is provided for completeness in case anyone wants to reconfigure their
    system on-the-fly.

    that it will always read a full record before returning.

  * Added exit-char option to sethost and proper usage message
  * Removed all references to dnmirror in man pages as it is now part of dnetd

  * rc script now installed into runlevel directory with RPM but will only start
    DECnet if /etc/decnet.conf exists

    root privileges for
  * 'make rpm' now honours all the prefixes and includes the right C++ libs
    from Debian
  * Cosmetic fixes to phone client

  * loadsabugs fixed in phone client
  * Some phoned bugs fixed too
