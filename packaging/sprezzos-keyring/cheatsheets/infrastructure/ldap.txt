We can now directly update LDAP records - That means that key updates
can now be handled directly by us. There are several tools that can be
used for this purpose - I'm using ud-info. For this, I have to use the
Debian password (and given I dislike passwords, I always regenerate it
by following http://db.debian.org/password.html and throwing it away).

keyring-maint has access to updating DD keys, but _not_ to change
their account status - That is, creating new DD accounts and retiring
DDs requires reassigning the tickets to DSA.

To edit a DD's entry, we specify his username - In this case, I will
edit Julien Danjou (acid)'s record (only the first couple of lines
shown), and a short menu of actions:

$ ud-info -r -u acid
Accessing LDAP entry for 'acid' as 'gwolf'
gwolf's password:

The record will be shown again. Note that the old key will still be
shown! You can switch user ('u') to the same user again and verify the
