  * New upstream release.
    - This is a development version.

      thrown and the error messages will be less accurate as with the
      original parser combinators.
    - The Xml2Haskell and Haskell2Xml classes are merged into a new
      XmlContent class.
    - A SAX like stream parser is added.
  * Sync Debian packaging with version 1.13.1-2.
