    - New functions: POSIX:FFS, POSIX:PATHCONF.
    - Bug fixes:
      + SOCKET:SOCKET-SERVER :INTERFACE now behaves as documented.
      + EXT:READ-BYTE-NO-HANG and SOCKET:SOCKET-STATUS used to hang on
        buffered binary sockets.
      + Allow DESTRUCTURING-BIND (a . b) with circular and dotted lists.
      + ADJUST-ARRAY of zero length adjustable string now works.
      + TIME now reports correct results when the heap grows over 4GB.

    Is a working debian host to test this on
    not nice? Sigh. We will see if it fails
    again. Seeing the logs would help.

    Thanks to Ubuntu to actually have the
    buildd logs available.
  * As it is impossible to have a dependency on gcc-3.3
    only for some architectures, have _all_ of them
    depend on gcc-3.3, but add build-essential
    for all other architectures.
  * Fixed Build-dep on libreadline-dev (Closes: #351339)

  * So with gcc-4 on sparc we got the pretty impressive:
    ;; Loading file defs1.lisp ...
    *** - quotient GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG\
    0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG / GGGGGGGG\
     is not an integer

    Now on m68k we get the even more impressive:

    cat '/build/buildd/clisp-2.35/src/intparam.c' >> tmp.c
    gcc -D SAFETY=3 -D NO_MULTIMAP_SHM -D NO_MULTIMAP_FILE \
     -D NO_SINGLEMAP -D NO_TRIVIALMAP tmp.c -o intparam
    tmp.c: In function 'main5':
    tmp.c:422: internal compiler error: in instantiate_virtual_regs_lossage,
    at function.c:1442

    So we're going to use gcc-3.3 for both architectures and hope
    that upstream or the gcc maintainers get this one right.

    Change: also use gcc-3.3 for m68k.

  * Update config.{guess,sub} (Closes: #104879)
  * Fix */autoconf/aclocal.m4's CL_CANONICAL_HOST macro
    to work with GNU system types where the 'os' portion takes
    the form 'kernel-system'
  * debian/rules: Remove config.cache files from source, and other
    miscellaneous clean fixes
  * debian/rules: Make /usr/lib/clisp/base a symlink to full
    (Closes: #69992)
  * Apply patch from Peter Naulls <peter@erble.freeserve.co.uk> to hopefully
    fix compilation on ARM. (Closes: #87395)
  * Don't try to remove files in /usr/share in debian/rules
    (Closes: #74610)
  * Compress documentation, and don't install impnotes.html twice
    (Closes: #96602)
  * Verified that /usr/share/doc/clisp/copyright is present; COPYRIGHT
    is the original file from the upstream sources (Closes: #96600)
  * Verified that build dependencies are present and sane (Closes: #70353)
  * Removed over 300k of SETI@Home data files added by diff.gz.  This, and
    the improved clean target result in a much more manageable diff.gz.
  * This package needs source code reorganization.  There are a lot of
    files duplicated within the package, and copied from other packages.
  * There is a far newer upstream version (2.27, 2001/07/16) which
    probably fixes many problems.
