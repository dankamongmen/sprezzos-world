flac (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. closes: #405167, #411311
    - libOggFLAC and libOggFLAC++ have been merged into libFLAC, so
      remove their corresponding packages.
    - Because of the API changes required to effect the above, there has
      been yet another soname bump. libflac7 -> libflac8 and
      libflac++5 -> libflac++6. Emails have been dispatched to the
      maintainers of dependent packages.
  * Some notes on patches that were removed:
    - 02_stdin_stdout, 06_manpage_mention_utf8_convert: merged upstream
    - 08_manpage_warnings: Upstream has changed the manpage so it defintely
      can't fit in in 80 cols, so just forget about it. We'll live.
    - 05_eof_warnings_are_errors: Upstream decided to add a -w option to
      flac to treat all warnings as errors. I am going to defer to that
      for now, but if people think it's stupid let me know and I'll port
      the patch forward.
    - 04_stack_smasher: was a backport from 1.1.3, so it's obsolete.

flac (0.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a build error with the xmms plugin that resulted in a broken
    xmms-flac.  Patch forwarded upstream. (Closes: #101827)

flac (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * From the upstream changelog:
  * FLAC 0.9 released.  There were some format changes that broke backwards
    compatibility but these should be the last (see below). Also, there have
    been several bug fixes and some new features:
      + FLAC's sync code has been lengthened to 14 bits from 9 bits. This
        should enable a faster and more robust synchronization mechanism.
      + Two reserved bits were added to the frame header.
      + A CRC-16 was added to the FLAC frame footer, and the decoder now does
        frame integrity checking based on the CRC.
      + The format now includes a new subframe field to indicate when a
        subblock has one or more 0 LSBs for all samples. This increases
        compression on some kinds of data.
      + Added two options to the analysis mode, one for including the residual
        signal in the analysis file, and one for generating gnuplot files of
        each subframe's residual distribution with some statistics. See the
        latest documentation.
      + XMMS plugin now supports 8-bit files.
    FLAC is on track for an official 1.0 release soon.

flac (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * From the upstream changelog:
  * This release is a result of extensive testing and fixes several bugs
    encountered when pushing the encoder to the limit. I'm pretty
    confident in the stability of the encoder/decoder now for all kinds of
    input. There have also been several features added. Here is a complete
    list of the changes since 0.7:
      + Created a new utility called metaflac. It is a metadata editor for
        .flac files. Right now it just lists the contents of the metadata
        blocks but eventually it will allow update/insertion/deletion.
      + Added two new metadata blocks: PADDING which has an obvious function,
        and APPLICATION, which is meant to be open to third party applications.
        See the latest format docs for more info, or the new id registration
        page.
      + Added a -P option to flac to reserve a PADDING block when encoding.    
      + Added support for 24-bit files to flac (the FLAC format always        
        supported it).                                                    
      + Started the Winamp3 plugin.                                            
      + Greatly expanded the test suite, adding more streams (24-bit streams,
        noise streams, non-audio streams, more patterns) and more option  
        combinations to the encoder. The test suite runs about 30 streams and
        over 5000 encodings now.                                      
  * This version includes a patch to configure.in from upstream CVS (an
    omitted AC_OUTPUT file).

flac (0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Note that this version contains a known bug that, according to the
    author, is revealed when encoding more than 2 channels using a large
    blocksize (>32k samples).  See
    http://flac.sourceforge.net/news.html#20010212 for more information.

flac (0.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Display a note about backward compatibility
  * Warn users of pre-0.6 versions about upgrading, as 0.6 cannot read
    files encoded with previous versions (Closes: #84630)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Feb 2001 20:46:22 -0500

flac (0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - encoding speed in default mode (-6) is at least 3x faster
    - a new "loose mid-side" adaptive algorithm should help -1 and -5 modes
    - a new analyze mode for developers                 
    - bug fixes related to pipes
  * Our automake patches have been incorporated upstream, so we no longer
    need them in the Debian diff
  * Added manpage for flac
  * Run ldconfig in postinst (oops)
  * Cleaned up debian/ directory

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Jan 2001 14:50:11 -0500

flac (0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed binary package sections to match override file (oops)
  * debian/rules: Set execute permissions on autoconf scripts created in the
    debian diff (Closes: #83105)
  * Honor DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS (nostrip, debug)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Jan 2001 14:57:31 -0500

flac (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
