  * Stop registering /usr/X11R6/lib in /etc/ld.so.conf in the postinst;
    instead, deregister it if no libraries remain in it.  Remove deregistration
    in postrm, and remove now-unnecessary postrm.
  * Add Build-Depends on libxcb1-dev >= 0.9.92 and libxcb-xlib0-dev >= 0.9.92.
  * Remove Build-Depends not needed with Xlib/XCB: bigreqsproto, xcmiscproto,
    libxau-dev, and libxdmcp-dev.
  * libx11-dev has some unnecessary Depends, but other packages currently rely
    on them, so removal will wait until a later version.
  * Add library, -dev, and -dbg packages for new library libX11-xcb.  Modify
    rules to handle these new packages.
  * libX11-xcb Conflicts: libx11-6 (<< 2:1.1), since it requires a version with
    Xlib/XCB.
  * Add a NEWS.Debian to libx11-6, with Xlib/XCB information.
  * Add XS-Vcs-Git field.
  * Remove old upstream CVS information from package descriptions.
  * Reword package descriptions to stop calling Xlib "the" client interface.

libx11 (2:1.0.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some patches got lost in the upgrade from 1.0.0 (2:1.0.0-9) to 1.0.3:
    - 015_russian_locale_alias.diff.  Closes: #368655.
      This aligns with the glibc russian definition of ru_RU.KOI8-R in
      /usr/share/locale/locale.alias.  Note that this only applies to
      Debian's glibc, see bug #62586 and glibc 2.2.5-4. Because of the
      constraint implosed by glibc in /usr/share/i18n/locales/ru_RU,
      we cannot likewise change ru and ru_RU away from ISO8859-5.
      They really should be using ru_RU.UTF-8 anyway.
    - 016_greek_polytonic_Compose.diff. Closes: #386471.
    - 017_FTBFS_makekeys.diff can be left out since it is applied in 1.0.3.

    Thibault, Robert Millan, and Michael Banck. Closes: #358708
  * Add 019_new_autoconf.diff to allow us to not break the server in
    horrendous ways using newer versions of autoconf. Thanks to Jamey Sharp
    for pointing this patch out in upstream HEAD.
  * Add 010_manpage_suffixes.diff to dynamically generate the internal manpage
    section using __libmansuffix__ the same way the actual file suffix is

    several characters with a single keystroke, so define them in
    en_US.UTF-8/Compose.  They will be added later to all UTF-8 files.
