.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCanonicalise\fP reads a XML document from a file or from the standard input and parses and pretty-prints the document using the HaXml library. 
\fBCanonicaliseLazy\fP also reads, parses and pretty-prints the XML document, but parses the document with the lazy parser combinators while \fBCanonicalise\fP uses the non-lazy parser combinators.
This causes \fBCanonicaliseLazy\fP to parse to XML document faster and use less memory then \fBCanonicalise\fP.  
\fBCanonicalise\fP and \fBCanonicaliseLazy\fP show the standard parsing and pretty-printing behaviour of the HaXml library.
