Subject: [PATCH 12/12] Makefile: add a knob to turn off hardlinks within same
 directory

The git builtins in $(gitexecdir) are implemented as hard links to a
single git binary by default, so even the overhead of symlink
resolution is not needed to run them.  However, the trick can be
harmful, in two cases:

 - on Windows, some tools to estimate directory size hugely
   overestimate the size of git (each hardlink counts as taking up the
   same amount of space as git.exe)

 - various filesystems have limits on the number of hardlinks that
   can be made to a particular file --- Linux's LINK_MAX is 127,
   _POSIX_LINK_MAX is 8, and btrfs has a limit of 4096 /
   ($len_filename + 8) or so links to a given inode in a single
   directory.

Normally that second case is not a problem (when ln fails, "make
install" falls back to "ln -s"), but if git is tar'ed up on one
filesystem and then extracted on a more limited one, it can result in
"Too many links" errors.

Nowadays people are encouraged to (and typically do) run builtins
using the "git" command name directly rather than those dashed forms
in scripts, making the use of hardlinks for the dashed forms a
somewhat pointless optimization.  Introduce a new knob to allow people
to turn it off with a simple "make install NO_HARDLINKS=YesPlease".

Typically someone using this setting would want to set
NO_CROSS_DIRECTORY_HARDLINKS, too, but that is not enforced, so you
can make $(bindir)/git and $(gitexecdir)/git into hardlinks to the
same inode and still make sure your tarball avoids the btrfs limits if
you want.
