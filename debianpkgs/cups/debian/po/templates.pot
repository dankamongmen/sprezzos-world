"The CUPS package contains a server that can accept BSD-style print jobs and "
"submit them to CUPS. It should only be set up if other computers are likely "
"to submit jobs over the network via the \"BSD\" or \"LPR\" services, and "
"these computers cannot be converted to use the IPP protocol that CUPS uses."

"The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) enforces a MIME type for all print "

"CUPS can handle all such jobs as \"raw\" jobs, which causes them to be sent "
