ogre-1.8 (1.8.0+dfsg1-3) unstable; urgency=low

    Thanks Bart Martens and Anton Gladky for reporting and collaborating in
    fixing the problem.

ogre-1.8 (1.8.0+dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove Samples altogether, since almost all of them contain or depend on
    non-free items (fonts and some media objects, see Debian and upstream bug
    report).
    After contacting upstream, they are not inclined to resolve the issue soon
    (read: it will take years and several major releases, if it happens at all).
    All of them are removed and there will be no attempt to track which ones are
    DFSG-compliant; it is quite a burden (thus decreasing the time that can be
    devoted to maintain the package in good shape, follow closely upstream
    updates, etc), and this is even more complicated with different sets of
    samples in every release (as it is the case now, with v1.7 and v1.8 in the
    Debian archive).
    This change encompasses the following actions/changes:
    - Repack the source (simply removing all ./Samples/)
    - Remove patch change_sample_cfg_path.patch, of no use now
    - Remove corresponding sample packages from debian/control
    - Remove files debian/*samples*.install
    - Closes: #684219 ("ogre contains non-free font from larabie collection")
  * Force Build-Depends and Depends of libogre-dev on version 1.49 (this
    particular one since it is the default for Wheezy).  OGRE exposes internal
    source code from boost which is sometimes incompatible between versions and
    might produce deadlocks with applications using/linking incompatible
    versions of boost.  The problem is probably not fixed completely, but this
    is an attempt to mitigate it (see the bug report for the discussion).
    Thanks Paul D Turner for the toughtful report and Steve M. Robbins for
    feedback.  (Closes: #688582).
  * Patches:
    - Add remove-alignment-hack.patch to drop obsolete stack alignment hack that
      breaks with gcc-4.7 (removed in upstream 1.8.1).  Thanks Julian Taylor and
      Kai Mast for the report and patch.  (Closes: #687013).

ogre (1.7.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depends on libois-dev changed to [linux-any] only, and samples
    packages built for only for [linux-any] as well, since OIS does not build in

  * Small reformat to debian/copyright to follow standards (a paragraph, content
    of a field, without a leading space)

ogre (1.7.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install /usr/share/OGRE-*/*.cfg files in the samples binary package instead
    of an arch-independent one, so it includes the correct path for plugins for
    each architecture (Closes: #663502)

ogre (1.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Change names of relevant packages with 1.7.3 for 1.7.4
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3 (no changes needed)
  * Enable building and installing the samples, including source code
    - Create new packages: ogre-samples, -data and -dbg
    - Add Build-Depends on libois-dev
    - Add debian/patches/change_sample_cfg_path.patch to make SampleBrowser be
      able to detect the plugins installed in the system, especially the
      Renderer, without which it cannot start.
  * Add "dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile /etc/OGRE/plugins.cfg" also in
    libogre-$(VERSION).postinst and .postrm (not only .preinst), to try to
    remove unmodified versions of the file from previous package revisions.
    Thanks again to Sam Morris, hopefully the bug is properly fixed this time
    (Closes: #656997).
    - Do the same for /etc/OGRE-1.7.3/plugins.cfg shipped in 1.7.3-5
  * Remove wrongly used "Multi-Arch: same" in -dev package, one of the files
    shipped is actually different in some architectures due to endian-ness
    differences (Closes: #658659).  Thanks Jakub Wilk.

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <manuel.montezelo@gmail.com>  Mon, 27 Feb 2012 14:42:45 +0000

ogre (1.7.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use always "versioned" directory names, like /usr/share/OGRE-1.7.3 and
    /usr/lib/MULTIARCH_TRIPLET/OGRE-1.7.3 instead of plain .../OGRE.  In this
    way several versions of the library can be installed at once, as it's
    usually the case with shared libraries but it was not with OGRE until now
    (Closes: #653527).
  * Add missing Build-Depend on "dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1~)" (instead of the
    suggested .0 of the bug report), and substituting DEB_BUILD_MULTIARCH for
    DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH (Closes: #658015).  The former was used by a propagated
    mistake.  Thanks Sam Morris for the notice and the patch (although I didn't
    use the patch provided because I had already changed the more problematic
    parts with a better solution).  Please reopen if there are still remaining
    problems.
  * Remove /etc/OGRE*/plugins.cfg, according to upstream it's not present in
    other systems, and indeed is more appropriate for applications to define
    what plugins they want to use (or rely only on code, not .cfg files, for
    that).
    - Remove the Debian script /usr/bin/update-ogre-plugins (and its manpage),
      it's of no use now.
    - Remove the template for plugins.cfg
  * Remove /etc/OGRE/plugins.cfg when uninstalling (or upgrading and moving the
    file elsewhere, as it happened for a few versions), if the one installed in
    the system was unmodified.  Thanks Sam Morris for the report and the
    suggested fix (Closes: #656997)
  * Remove cruft provided in the past along with the package but not used for a
    few releases/years:
    - LightwaveConverter.1: binary not present since very long
    - ogre-get-orig-source-1.6.4: script obsolete and unnecessary since with 1.7
      -- it's been clarified that the documentations and the samples are DFSG
      compatible

ogre (1.7.3-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency set to high because the version in testing (1.7.3-3) is quite
    broken, and will not work for most people.
  * Moving configuration and plugins in directories named just "OGRE" to
    "OGRE-${VERSION}", so actually several versions of the library can be
    installed at the same time.
  * Fixing paths in the shipped plugins.cfg for the new location of the plugins
    in multi-arch environment, including RPATH for the plugins using it.
  * Remove debian/extras/ogre-plugins-config.in and ogre-plugins-config.1
    (corresponding man page).  As far as I know they were never used, and
    introducing such a tool creates more harm than good in my opinion
    (divergence from upstream and needlessly doing things ad-hoc that should be
    managed by the users of the library).

ogre (1.7.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabling some hardening and linking options, they were causing severe
    problems for some users with the application aborting during initialisation
    (Launchpad bug LP: #913523), confirmed in Debian.  I think that the main
    culprit is "-Wl,-Bsymbolic", although other hardening flags were disabled
    because of compilation failures after disabling the previous one (+pie).

  * Remove Michael Koch <konqueror@gmx.de> as Uploader, not active for years and
    only active for a brief period in time

ogre (1.7.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed debhelper compat to level 8 (level 7 before), no changes needed
  * Overriding lintian errors of embedded libraries; the modified TinyXML
    library redefines base string classes to match OGRE's and thus it's not
    straightforward to unravel; and 'glew' as part of a GL rendering plugin:
    - 'embedded-library usr/bin/OgreXMLConverter: tinyxml'
    - 'embedded-library usr/lib/OGRE/RenderSystem_GL.so: glew'

  * The Manual and API Reference are now licensed under CC 3.0 (Closes: #612150)

ogre (1.7.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplifying a lot debian/rules file by leveraging debhelper capabilities,
    only acting when deviating from auto behaviour
  * Fix lintian warning 'spelling-error-in-changelog: architechture', introduced
    in 1.7.1-3
  * Remove binaries of ogre-tools in libogremain-VERSION-dbg, they appeared
    there for some reason

 -- Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo <manuel.montezelo@gmail.com>  Thu, 02 Jun 2011 00:16:35 +0200

ogre (1.7.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improvements to the copyright file, especially including MIT license text
    instead of pointing to a file which does not exist
  * Reorganising Replaces and replacing Conflicts with Breaks to include only
    versions 1.4.9 and 1.6.4 (this one missing from a couple of places) -- thus
    effectively ignoring versions from ancient releases from Debian
  * Remove fix_pthread.patch, which does not seem to be needed.  It was already
    disabled in previous build and no problems were detected, and this URL seems
    to indicate that the problem is known and fixed in 1.7.0:
    http://www.ogre3d.org/mantis/view.php?id=256
  * Fix 'watch' file so it works correctly with all released sources up to now
  * Remove 'compiledemos.sh', it was neglected since v1.4.9 a few years ago,
    it's a bit hackish and lacks proper clean-up mechanisms (as stated in
    comments inside the script itself).  Also, updating the script from revision
    to revision (sometimes with new demos/samples, or removed ones) is annoying
    to maintain for little benefit (see #561614).  Now the building system with
    CMake takes care of compiling all of the demos/samples at once, or it's very
    easy to compile each one individually.
  * Try to fix FTBFS in ARMEL architecture, patch
    fix_bug_613924-ftbfs_armel.diff (Closes: #613924)

ogre (1.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (Closes: #577687).
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility from 5 to 7 (no changes).
  * Bumped Standards-Version from 3.8.3 to 3.9.1 (no changes).
  * Updated 'watch' file, the name of the archives is not very regular.
  * License changed from LGPL-2.1+ to MIT in 1.7, changes to 'copyright' file.
  * Bug fixed upstream where "config.h" file was included from current dir
    (instead of Ogre includes) (Closes: #520913).
  * Use source/format '3.0 (quilt)' (project already used 'quilt').
  * Many tweaks needed to get things working: libraries changed names slightly,
    .so use version in filename, using CMake vs autotools as building system
    (requiring many changes in the rules file), need to remove and rename some
    locally created man pages, some command line tools removed (MaterialUpgrade)
    or renamed (MeshUpgrade -> -r), ...
  * CEGUI-OGRE Renderer is not present (so the 3 related binary packages go
    away).

ogre (1.2.4-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (Closes: #398110). It has been set to the pkg-games team
    to ease comaintenance.
  * New upstream release (Closes: #368277).
  * Acknowledge NMUs. Thanks to:
     - Steinar H. Gunderson <sgunderson@bigfoot.com> (Closes: #349420)
     - Luk Claes <luk@debian.org> (Closes: #358006, #357374)
    for having taken care of ogre by NMU-ing it when needed.

  [Tarball repack]
  * Repacked tarball as follows:
     - tar xfj ogre-linux_osx-v1-2-4.tar.bz2
     - # see notes above
     - mv ogrenew/ ogre-free/
     - tar cfz ogre-free.tar.gz ogre-free
  * Notes:
     - comparing with previous Debian packages, it looks like disabling the
       build of the CgProgramManager plugin is sufficient
     - TODO: check for non-free stuff in ogrenew/
     - at the moment, those actions are performed during the tarball repack:
         find ogrenew -name CVS -execdir \
         	rm CVS/{Entries,Repository,Root,Tag} ';'
         find ogrenew -name CVS -execdir \
         	rmdir CVS ';'

  [Debian patches]
  * Updated:
     - 01_dont_build_samples: more subdirs have to be disabled;
     - 10_gcc_4.1_mips: mips-specific patch, has to be sent upstream.
  * Deactivated:
     - 03_ogre_to_OGRE: looks like not needed anymore;
     - 08_fix_soname: looks like not needed anymore;
     - 09_gcc_4.1: patch integrated upstream.

  [SONAME and debhelper bumps]
  * Bumped SONAME from 5(c2a) to 12. Conflicts: and Replaces: updated
    accordingly, as well as filenames under debian/ and debian/rules content.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility and B-D from 4 to 5. Needed changes:
     - Removed ``usr/lib/*.a'' from libogre-dev.install since there is no such
       file anymore. And now dh_install fails when expanding a wildcard to
       nothing.
     - Changed the --dbg-package option of dh_strip from `libogre12' to
       `libogre12-dbg'.

  [debian/control]
  * Added libcegui-mk2-dev to libogre-dev's Depends: so that pkg-config
    dependencies are OK.
  * NMU-safe: Turned `${Source-Version}' into `${binary:Version}', added a
    versioned build dependency on dpkg-dev, so that it should be NMU-safe
    (according to http://wiki.debian.org/binNMU).
  * Standards-Version bumped to 3.7.2.

  [Library fixes, debian/rules]
  * Added a call to `chrpath' on a .so file declaring a rpath on /usr/lib and
    added also a build dependency on this package.
  * Added the `/usr/lib/libOgrePlatform.so' in debian/libogre-dev.install so
    that it is shipped as well as `/usr/lib/libCEGUIOgreRenderer.so' is, and
    thus removed from debian/libogre12.install.
    TODO: Check that nothing is broken this way!
  * Removed unneeded call to libtool_clean.sh and removed that script since
    it's not longer needed.
  * Deleted (unused) library version declarations.

  [Lintian overrides]
  * Added lintian overrides about the soname issues: libOgreMainNNN is the
    library from which we take the SONAME. The other looks like internal and
    haven't change for a while. If they do, we'll consider building separate
    packages for them. The overrides are documented in the following file
    debian/libogre12.lintian-overrides.
    Updated libogre12.{dirs,install} accordingly.
  * Added lintian overrides to the blender-ogrexml package about the
    unusual-for-lintian but usual-for-blender interpreter (#!BPY).
    Updated blender-ogrexml.{dirs,install} accordingly.
 
  [Documentation]
  * Added `elinks' to Build-Depends, so that a proper changelog and other
    useful documentation can be generated from the HTML files.  Maybe one
    could want to use alternatives, but I'm not sure it's really useful. About
    the choice of elinks, it looks like quite well maintained.
  * Rewritten the debian/rules to put the documentation in order (e.g. a html/
    folder containing all HTML documentation), plain text files when HTML is
    not needed, etc.
  * Added an annotation in the README.Debian file of libogre-dev about the
    ``upcoming 1.0'' release. TODO: Update and rewrite that part.
