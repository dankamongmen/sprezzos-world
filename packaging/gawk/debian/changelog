  * New upstream BETA version.

 -- James Troup <james@nocrew.org>  Sat, 12 Jun 1999 20:13:31 +0100

gawk (3.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control (Standards-Version): Upgraded to 2.5.0.0.
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): don't compress examples.  [#14705]
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): pass `--libexecdir=/usr/lib' to configure
    to ensure passwd.awk knows where pwcat and grcat are.  [#22458 (1/4)]
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): `fix' the oh-so-important `bug' of an extra
    slash being passed to make in the libexecdir parameter. [#22458 (3/4)]

gawk (3.0.3-1) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/control (Maintainer): New maintainer.  However, I'm just an
    interim real maintainer, the package will go back to Chris as soon as
    he's ready.
  * debian/control (Standards-Version): Upgraded to 2.4.1.0.
  * debian/control (Depends): Made a Pre-Depends. [#20600]
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): Recompress everything but copyright under
    /usr/doc/gawk/, I'm afraid I agree with Scott and I don't subscribe to
    the debstd-style view of not compressing ``small'' files.
  * Restore Chris's debian/rules, as it was butchered by a non-maintainer
    upload.  Does no one listen to the "Maintainers other than the usual
    package maintainer should make as few changes to the package as
    possible" in policy?
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): don't install gawk-3.0.3.
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): don't install igawk.sh into
    /usr/doc/gawk/examples/ as we have igawk in /usr/bin/.
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): install architecture independent files
    from awklib in /usr/share/awk/ and architecture dependant files in
    /usr/lib/awk/. (3.0.3-0.{2,3} were confused about this)
  * awklib/eg/prog/igawk.sh: SECURITY: use mktemp to create temporary
    files instead of using gratuitously insecure /tmp/ig.[se].$$.
    3.0.3-0.3 altered the wrong file, fixing nothing and failed to exit if
    mktemp/tempfile failed. [*really* fixes #19713]
  * debian/control (Depends): depend on debianutils >= 1.7 (for mktemp).
  * debian/rules (clean): remove emacs backup files (*~).
  * pc/awklib/igawk: restore original.

  * Bugs fixed in 3.0.3-0.2 by Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es> but
    described by nothing more than a bug report number are :-
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): pass correct values for datadir and
    libexecdir to make to avoid installing files in random places during
    make install. [#11339, #11435]
  * debian/rule (binary-arch): don't install a gawk-3.0.3 manpage
    symlink. [#13893, #17279]
  * debian/rules (binary-arch): install examples in
    /usr/doc/gawk/examples, not /usr/doc/gawk/awlib/eg/ [#16610 1/6].
    install pwcat and grcat uncompressed and stripped into /usr/lib/awk/
    [#16610 2/6].  Don't install the Makefile* from awklib [#1660 3/6],
    don't install the C source for pwcat and grcat [#16610 4/6], don't
    install the source for group.awk and passwd.awk [#16610 5/6] and
    install awklib/lib/* in /usr/lib/awk [#16610 5/6].

  * Bugs fixed in 3.0.3-0.1 by Martin Mitchell <martin@debian.org>, not by
    Santiago as he claims :-
  * New upstream version. [#10228]
  * New upstream version fixes memory leak [#12308] and problems with "awk
    'END { getline < "/dev/user" ; print }' /dev/null". [#13131]
