Description: Python 2.x bindings for gobject-introspection libraries
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x binding generator for libraries that
 support gobject-introspection, i. e. which ship a gir1.2-<name>-<version>
 package. With these packages, the libraries can be used from Python.
