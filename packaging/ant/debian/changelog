ant (1.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed empty line from src/main/org/apache/tools/ant/defaultManifest.mf.
    Thanks to Ken Harris and Marko Kreen for investigation! (closes: #112261)
  * Use $JAVA_HOME/bin/java instead of /usr/bin/java if the former
    exists, Thanks to Taso Lyristis for the patch!
  * Respect $JAVACMD and $ANT_OPTS in /usr/bin/ant as the documentation
    says. Thanks to Marko Kreen for the patch! (closes: #119611)
  * Only append JAR files in /usr/share/ant/lib/ to the CLASSPATH if
    the file actually exists to avoid problems with dangling symlinks
  * Include symlinks to optional JARs from other packages into the package
    instead of creating them in the postinst. However, ant still only
    suggests these packages. (closes: #124378)
  * Also include symlink to js.jar from rhino. (closes: #130624)
  * Check the length of osname in src/main/org/apache/tools/tar/TarEntry.java
    to avoid StringIndexOutOfBoundsException on Linux. (closes: #126479)
  * Added getMode() to src/main/org/apache/tools/tar/TarEntry.java, taken
    from upstream CVS. (closes: #126472)
  * Build API docs and put them together with the HTML manual in the new
    ant-doc package (closes: #125144)
  * Install the JARs as /usr/share/java/ant-$version-*.jar and create 
    /usr/share/java/ant-*.jar symlinks as recommended by the Java policy
  * Use dh_installman instead of dh_installmanpages so ant.1 and build.5
    are only included in the main package
  * Make ant-doc conflict with previous versions of ant because of
    overlapping files

  * New upstream release
  * Use libxalan2-java instad of libxalan-java
  * Build support for liblog4j and libregexp-java
  * Suggest jython and include its JAR in Ant's class path so Python

 -- Stefan Gybas <sgybas@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Sep 2001 12:09:10 +0200

ant (1.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built using Sun's javac instead of jikes (closes: #107326)

 -- Stefan Gybas <sgybas@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Aug 2001 16:46:53 +0200

ant (1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built Ant using JMF, JUnit, Xalan and ANTLR so some extra tags are
    supported in build.xml
  * Add optional packages to CLASSPATH at installation time if they are
    installed

 -- Stefan Gybas <sgybas@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Jul 2001 23:33:15 +0200

ant (1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also move binary package to contrib

 -- Stefan Gybas <sgybas@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Jul 2001 00:45:46 +0200

ant (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #95866)
  * Build using j2dsk1.3 instead of kaffe because kaffe lacks too many
    JDK 1.2 features and is too buggy to even run Ant. Unfortunately, this
    requires moving ant from main to contrib but it fixes many Ant
    problems. (closes: #105737)
  * Use debhelper V3
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.6 (no changes required)
  * Call bootstraop.sh to build ant, this fixes the problem with missing
    files in the resulting ant.jar (closes: #85802, #90023, #90024, #93400,
    #98207, #106468)
  * Include man pages ant.1 and build.xml.5, thanks to Egon Willighagen
    (closes: #92975)
  * Add tools.jar to Ant's classpath if $JAVA_HOME is defined
  * Updated README.Debian
  * Build using libbsf-java and liboro-java so advanced features can be used.
    Added suggestions for these packages.
