  * Run as user daemon, rather than root (from 3.1.8-11ubuntu3) (closes: #251058)
    + Derooted /usr/bin/at.
    + at.c:
      - Keep real uid, only switch to daemon gid when unlinking files (the
        directory is daemon-group writeable, but the job files are owned by user).
      - Instead of creating the job file and then fchown()'ing it (which does
        not work when running as non-root), change to the real gid when
        creating the file.
    + atd.c:
      - Don't check that the file gid is equal to the execution gid (since job
        files are now always owned by "daemon".
      - setgid() to the user's gid, not to the file gid for job execution.
    + debian/rules:
      - Install /usr/bin/at as daemon:daemon 6555 instead of root:root 4755
        (running as user daemon is necessary to be allowed to send a signal to
         atd.)
      - Install /etc/at.deny as root:daemon 640 instead of root:root 0600.
    + debian/postinst:
      - Make /var/spool/cron/{atjobs,atspool} writeable for group "daemon".
      - Update permissions of /etc/at.{allow,deny} if we upgrade from a previous
        version and there is no statoverride for these files.

  * Add optional PAM support based on the submitted patch (closes: #68364)
  * Use AC_FUNC_GETLOADAVG and getloadavg.c from XEmacs, so that the
    system function is used first, then the getloadavg.c from at if it isn't
    available (closes: #269440)
  * Fix permissions of /var/spool/cron/at* in the deb files to match what is
    used now
  * Remove /usr/sbin/atrun; the packaging is set up for running as a daemon.
  * Align batch(1) with SUSv3 by accepting no arguments (closes: #70988)

    before the job submission starts (closes: #257074)

  * SIGCHLD handler now correctly loops on a non-blocking waitpid.
    Hopefully this gets rid of zombies even on SMP systems
    (closes: Bug#60549).
  * Changed AC_FUNC_GETLOADAVG to AC_REPLACE_FUNCS(getloadavg) in
    configure.in since it introduces a spurious depencency on libelfg0
    whenever that package is installed on the build machine.
    (closes: Bug#61295). 
  * configure.in: rewrote directory tests such that configure fails due to
    a missing SPOOLDIR only when --with-jobdir or --with-atspool doesn't
    specify an explicit path.
