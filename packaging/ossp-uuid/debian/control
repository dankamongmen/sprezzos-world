Description: OSSP uuid ISO-C and C++ - shared library
 OSSP uuid is an ISO-C and Perl application programming interface (API)
 and corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of
 DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant Universally Unique Identifier
 (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node
 based), version 3 (name based) and version 4 (random number based).
 .
 UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
 of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult
 to guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
 generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs
 are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
 with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
 persistent objects across a network.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: perl OSSP::UUID - OSSP uuid Perl Binding

 are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
 with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
 persistent objects across a network.
 .
 OSSP::uuid provides two Perl APIs:
 .
 The OO-style API is a wrapper around the C-style API and intended for
 high-level and regular programming.
 .
 The C-style API is a direct mapping of the OSSP uuid ISO-C API to Perl and
 is intended for low-level programming.
 .
 The Debian package provides also Data::UUID interface so OSSP::uuid can be
 used as free replacement for non-DFSG Perl module.
