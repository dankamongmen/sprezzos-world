poppler (0.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Upstream fixed the Qt build bug, so now I can enable Qt
    build. (Closes:#307340) It leads two new binary packages
    libpoppler0-qt and libpoppler-qt-dev.
  * Excluded DEB_CONFIGURE_SYSCONFDIR setting, which is obsolete by the
    upstream removal of xpdfrc config.
