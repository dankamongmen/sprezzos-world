libgpod (0.3.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add libgpod-common package back from Ubuntu packaging after
    Sebastian Bacher pointed out that this indeed makes sense
    because we loose the possibility to install more than one
    version of the library otherwise.

libgpod (0.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add libgtk2.0-dev and libglib2.0-dev to dependencies of
    libgpod-dev since these are in fact needed. (Closes: #353590)
  * Use high urgency for trivial RC bug fix.

libgpod (0.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some changes to the build-depends (as suggested
    by Christian Marillat):
    + Add libgtk2.0-dev since that is needed for
      artkwork support (Closes: #345534)
    + Replace build-depends on libxml-parser-perl with
      dependency on intltool since that is what we really want
      (Closes: #345543)

libgpod (0.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian Release (Closes: #345160)
    - This is essentially the Ubuntu packaging therefor I include
      the Ubuntu changelog up to this point
  * Changes to the Ubuntu packaging:
    + Don't build-depend on packages not available in unstable yet
      (drop libhal-dev and libdbus-glib-1-dev)
    + change maintainer address to me
    + make copyright file a little more verbose and exact
    + update debhelper compat level to 5
    + drop libgpod-common package. Just too small for my taste
