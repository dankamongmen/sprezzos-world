  * New upstream version:
    - eliminate setLEDAsusWireless altogether; this needs to be handled
      directly by the kernel when the kill switch is toggled, not in a racy
      and inconsistently-applied manner by acpi-support; and in at least some
      cases we know this already *does* happen because of reports that
      /sys/devices/platform/asus-laptop/wlan, used for toggling "the LED" with
      the current kernel module, is actually an interface for toggling *the
      antenna* that happens to also toggle the LED.  Likewise, we should not
      be responsible for bringing up the antenna at boot, so get rid of the
      file in the start.d directory.  LP: #293943, #204378, #334368.
    - Remove the asus-wireless-2 event handler, which is completely redundant
      with the pre-existing asus-wireless-{off,on} handlers.  LP: #207871.
    - Add support for ATKD 00000037 to events/asus-touchpad.

acpi-support (0.129-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - Fix ibm-wireless to use the 'rfkill' tool for toggling bluetooth,
      recommending wireless-tools which currently provides this; and fix
      the isAnyWirelessPoweredOn function for the latest change in the rfkill
      /sys interface, looking under phy80211/ instead of under device/
      (LP: #397698).  The toggleAllWirelessStates() function is still broken,
      because the rfkill state on the iwl3945 (at least) is still being done
      in the kernel, so we work around this for now by leaving the function
      inactive.
      Closes: #548252, #554112, #491442
    - Fix the touchpad handler to use xinput instead of (unreliable)
      synclient, and add a corresponding Recommends; and call getXconsole so
      we can actually talk to the X server.  LP: #447211.
    - new events/asus-f8sv-touchpad: handle another touchpad ACPI event on
      another ASUS model.  LP: #218598.
    - lib/power-funcs: adjust getXconsole to work when the tty number is not
      present on the X commandline.
    - lib/policy-funcs: Recognize KDE4 PowerDevil as a power manager.
      LP: #387750.
    - lib/policy-funcs: Recognize xfce4-power-manager as a power manager.
      LP: #425155
    - Drop /etc/acpi/start.d/90-hdparm.sh: this is redundant because we're
      already calling pm-powersave on start (either via /etc/acpi/power.sh,
      or by one of the desktop power managers as enumerated in
      lib/policy-funcs) so there's no reason we should be reapplying the
      policy here.  LP: #443992, #438355, #318980.
      Closes: #509597, #529604, #533754
    - Add guidance-power-manager to the list of known desktop power managers.
      LP: #154910
    - lib/policy-funcs: Recognize dalston as a power manager.  LP: #432578
    - Drop /etc/acpi/start.d/10-save-dmidecode.sh, which is irrelevant given
      the existence of /sys/class/dmi/id/.
    - Drop events/panasonic-brightness-{down,up}, events/panasonic-mute,
      events/panasonic-volume-{down,up}, and panabright.sh, confirmed to be
      implemented now by the panasonic-laptop kernel driver. Closes: #555603
    - Drop events/asus-{a6u-touchpad,internet,lock,wireless} and
      events/asus-media-{next,play-pause,prev,stop}, confirmed to be
      implemented by the asus-laptop kernel driver.
    - Drop events/thinkpad-thinkpad and thinkpad-thinkpad.sh, which is also
      implemented in the thinkpad_acpi driver and should have been dropped a
      while ago.
    - Drop panapower.sh, which seems to have never been used.
    - Clean up /etc/acpi/toshbright.sh, which was meant to be removed back in
      jaunty
    - Drop events/video_brightness{down,up}, video_brightness{up,down}.sh: at
      least some platforms that use these ACPI sequences are seeing them
      correctly translated to input events, so those users will see duplicate
      events unless we drop them.  LP: #178860.
      Closes: #556261
    - Drop events/sony-eject, confirmed in bug reports to no longer work due
      to its use of acpi_fakekey.  This needs to be implemented in the kernel
      input layer, but in the meantime there's no reason to keep this here.
      LP: #76924.
    - Drop events/panasonic-{hibernatebtn,sleepbtn}, also reported to not work
      now due to the acpi_fakekey implementation.
    - Don't install power hook directories, instead just call pm-powersave
  * Added old powersave stuff to examples.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.3, no changes needed.
  * Re-diffed patches
  * Re-added hibernatebtn.sh that was removed upstream.
  * Re-added Sony brightness files. Closes: #531074

    keys not available on the keyboard by sending keys through uinput.
    Closes: #373660 - Thanks to: Thomas Jaeger <ThJaeger@gmail.com>

acpi-support (0.95-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove spurious file acpi-support_0.90-2.diff.gz added in the repository
    during last merge (it's still in the orig.tar.gz though).
  * Add a new SKIP_INTERFACES variables in /etc/default/acpi-support and use
    it to define network interfaces that are not tied to hardware to avoid
    shutting them down during suspend.
  * Properly remove files that have been removed in the SVN in the clean
    target. This is required because the files are still present in the
    .orig.tar.gz file (otherwise autobuilder builds will have the unwanted
    files).
  * Add XS-Vcs-* fields in debian/control.

acpi-support (0.95-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Bart Samwel ]
  * New upstream versions (from Ubuntu Feisty and Gutsy).
    * 0.95: Clean up issues with toggling multiple wireless cards.
      - Move variable initiation into loop inside 'wireless.sh'
      - Move contents of 'wireless.sh' into 
        lib/state-funcs:toggleAllWirelessState()
      - Update '{ibm,tosh,asus}-wireless.sh' to use state-funcs
    * 0.95: Remove spurious 'echo HERE' from lib/state-funcs.  D'oh.
    * 0.94: Save and restore values that the kernel does not preserve across
      suspend/resume and hibernate/resume:
      - /sys/class/net/eth*/device/rf_kill
      - /proc/acpi/ibm/bluetooth
      - /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
    * 0.94: White list Lenovo ThinkPad Z60m as working suspend.
    * 0.93: Change 'wireless.sh' to use 'device/rf_kill' for wireless
      devices (if available) in preference to 'device/power/state' which
      has been removed by the upstream kernel developers.
    * 0.93: Teach 'lib/state-funcs:isAnyWirelessPoweredOn( )' to also check
      'device/rf_kill' if it's available.
    * 0.93: Change 'ibm-wireless.sh' to rotate wireless and bluetooth states
    * 0.93: Correct inverted logic in 'isAnyWirelessPoweredOn()'.
    * 0.93: Change script shebangs to use '/bin/sh' instead of '/bin/bash'.
    * 0.92: Add 'events/sony-eject' for Sony Vaio TX3.
  * Stop pretending to control laptop-mode-tools, which
    only works (and badly too) in the upstream Ubuntu version. The lmt
    package provides its own acpi bindings. Add reference in config file
    to laptop-mode-tools as a replacement for the current non-working
    configuration option. (Closes: #425800)
  * Change Recommends of laptop-mode-tools to Suggests. This should prevent
    automatic enabling of laptop mode for unsuspecting users, it should not
    be installed by default.
  * Check that acpi-support is still installed in script configuration files.
    (Closes: #424752)
  * Change order of PCI video state restoration so that it is always the last
    to be saved and the first to be restored. (Closes: #396897)
  * Only use ifup/ifdown for interfaces listed by /etc/network/run/ifstate.
    For other interfaces that are up, use "ifconfig down" to force them down,
    and restart network-manager and ifplugd after resume to bring them back up.
    (Closes: #373659)
  * Do not ifup/down "lo" and "dummy..." interfaces over suspend.
    (Closes: #427128)
  * Removed bash dependencies. (Note that this may break custom scripts in
    /etc/acpi that contain bashisms, as the scripts are sourced, not just
    executed.) (Closes: #407510)
  * Instead of only restoring the hardware clock on resume, stop and start the
    hwclock.sh service over suspend. (Closes: #389537)
  * Move radeontool call out of loop in lid.sh. (Mentioned in bug 391498, but
    does not solve the bug.)
  * Potential fix for "sometimes lid.sh doesn't work" bug. (Part of bug 391498,
    but not enough to close it.)
  * Bump up Debhelper compatibility level to 5.
  * Remove useless use of grep in asus-touchpad.sh.

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Mark Bart as Maintainer.
  * Put myself in Uploaders instead.
  * Sponsor upload for Bart. Change version to 0.95-1.
  * Manually remove (or move out of the way) old scripts in postint. Concerns:
    - /etc/acpi/suspend.d/80-video-pci-state.sh
    - /etc/acpi/resume.d/49-855-resolution-set.sh
    - /etc/acpi/resume.d/13-855-resolution-set.sh
    - /etc/modprobe.d/toshiba_acpi.modprobe
  * Documents policy for handling obsolete configuration files in
    README.Debian.

acpi-support (0.90-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't pass any arguments to s2disk as it doesn't support these in newer
    uswsusp versions.
  * Fix "APCI" instead of "ACPI" typo in IBM.config; thanks Joshua Kwan;

    * 0.89: Add support for high-res uswsusp
    * 0.88: Change defaults

    * 0.86: Remove stop links from rc0 and rc6
    * 0.85: Don't unload nsc-ircc on suspend
  * Add ${shlibs:Depends} and call to dh_shlibdeps. Closes: #383449
  * 855resolution is no more in Debian, replaced by 915resolution. 
    Closes: #381210
  * Improved description, thanks to Clément Stenac. Closes: #383691
  * Removed README.toshiba which doesn't apply to Debian (or which doesn't
    apply any more, the toshiba_acpi option indicated doesn't exist in
    2.6.17.7). Closes: #383326

acpi-support (0.84-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Put laptop-mode-tools in Recommends instead of Depends to not force the
    user to use it: it can be painful to have to wait for the disk to spin up
    and the gain is not always worth it with recent (very small) hard-disks.
  * Add upstream changelog.

acpi-support (0.80-1) unstable; urgency=low
