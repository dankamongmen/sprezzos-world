Description: Development files for the tesseract command line OCR tool
 The Tesseract OCR engine was one of the top 3 engines in the 1995
 UNLV Accuracy test. Between 1995 and 2006 it had little work done on
 it, but since then it has been improved extensively by Google and is
 probably one of the most accurate open source OCR engines
 available. It can read a wide variety of image formats and convert
 them to text in over 40 languages.
