expect (5.45-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replaced ckalloc() call in exp_clib.c by malloc() because using the
    ordinary free() leads to memory corruption after ckalloc() (which is
    a macro for Tcl_Alloc()). See patches/22-segfault-with-stubs.patch
    for segfaulting examples.

    segmentation fault.

expect (5.44.1.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed build dependencies which are also dependencies of tk8.5-dev
    (since 8.5.7-2).
  * Use locally defined function Tcl_ErrnoMsg in exp_clib.c because this
    part of the library is supposed to be used without loading into a Tcl

    where an instruction on how to patch upstream sources is located.
  * Removed examples from /usr/share/doc/expect-dev/examples because all of
    them are shipped in /usr/bin directory. This makes uncompressing them
    unnecessary (closes: #495605).

    rftp and weather to avoid conflicts with other packages
    (closes: #508320, #532332).

    (closes: #550909).
