  [ Iain Lane ]
  * New upstream release 0.7.1 "The Big Switch"
   + Second release of the unstable 0.7 development series. Most notably
     including a switch to Taglib#. Regressions in the amount of RAW
     types supported, will be fixed before releasing 0.8.
   + Switched to a new Taglib#-backed metadata layer. This is a huge change
     which should bring us increased stability (in the long run) and a much
     easier to maintain metadata layer than the one we previously had. Also
     enables some funky new features like XMP sidecars. (Ruben Vermeersch,
     Mike Gemünde) (LP: #279440, #69577, #260706)

    place so just setting it directly in the target doesn't hurt.

  [ Sebastien Bacher ]
  * debian/rules: update the translation template after the build, the change
    doesn't make a difference for debian but is required for ubuntu and will
    let the package stay in sync between distributions (Closes: #549019)
