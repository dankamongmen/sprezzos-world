  CeCILL FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
  
  
  Notice
  
  This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
  of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
  the two main principles guiding its drafting:
  
  * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
  of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to
  users,
  * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which
  it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
  intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
  both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.
  
  The authors of the CeCILL (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[logiciel] L[ibre])
  license are:
  
  Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical
  and industrial research establishment, having its principal place of
  business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.
  
  Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific
  and technological research establishment, having its principal place of
  business at 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.
  
  Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique -
  INRIA, a public scientific and technological establishment, having its
  principal place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP
  105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex, France.
  
  
  Preamble
  
  The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
  the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
  license within the framework of an open source distribution model.
  
  The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations
  for users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.
  
  In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
  modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
  with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
  economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
  
  In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
  and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
  the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
  complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
  developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
  knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the suitability
  of the software as regards their requirements in conditions enabling
  the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more
  generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security.
  This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not
  altered, and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom.
  
  This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
  the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

  Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES
  
  7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
  provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.
  
  However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
  terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
  maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
  Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
  shall incur liability therefor.
  
  7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under
  its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon
  itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified
  Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said
  warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,
  shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor
  and the Licensee.
  
  
  Article 8 - LIABILITY
  
  8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be
  entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered
  from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant
  Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.
  
  8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under
  this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:
  (i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its
  obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the
  Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more
  generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly
  agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
  loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
  opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
  legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
  shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
  any or all compensation from the Licensor.
  
  
  Article 9 - WARRANTY
  
  9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
  state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
  possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
  possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
  attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
  modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
  reserved for experienced users.
  
  The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
  the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working order,
  and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or
  properties.
  
  9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
  to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
  rights set forth in Article 5).
  
  9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
  the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
  that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty
  as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant
  nature.
  
  Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
  from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
  be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
  configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.
  
  9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
  Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
  relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
  the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
  arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
  instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
  Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
  the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
  assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be
  decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
  Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
  disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
  name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
  prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
  of a trademark.
  
  
  Article 10 - TERMINATION
  
  10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
  hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
  thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has
  remained ineffective.
  
  10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be
  authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any
  licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement
  shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance
  with the terms and conditions hereof.
  
  
  Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS
  
  
  11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS
  
  Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to
  perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force
  majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective
  functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications
  networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by
  government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,
  fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.
  
  11.2 Any failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to invoke
  one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be
  interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its right to
  invoke said provision(s) subsequently.
  
  11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,
  whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same
  purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said
  Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the
  terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties
  unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized
  representatives.
  
  11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to
  conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text,
  said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make
  the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative
  text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity
  of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not
  cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.
  
  
  11.5 LANGUAGE
  
  The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions
  are deemed authentic.
  
  
  Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT
  
  12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this
  Agreement.
  
  12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is
  protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, who
  reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the
  Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may
  address new issues encountered by Free Software.
  
  12.3 Any Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may
  only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement
  or a subsequent version, subject to the provisions of Article 5.3.4.
  
  
  Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
  
  13.1 The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to
  endeavor to seek an amicable solution to any disagreements or disputes
  that may arise during the performance of the Agreement.
  
  13.2 Failing an amicable solution within two (2) months as from their
  occurrence, and unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the
  disagreements or disputes shall be referred to the Paris Courts having
  jurisdiction, by the more diligent Party.
