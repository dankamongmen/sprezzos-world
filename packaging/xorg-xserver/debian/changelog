xorg-server (2:1.12.1.902-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * xvfb-run: kill Xvfb when the script dies.
  * xvfb-run: instead of waiting 3 seconds and hoping that's enough for Xvfb
    to come up (and waiting 2.9 seconds too many in the general case), tell it
    to send us SIGUSR1 when it's ready to accept connections.  This reduces
    "xvfb-run -- xterm -e true" from ~3.2s to ~0.4s on a quick test.
  * xvfb-run: fix xauth handling; setting XAUTHORITY when starting an X server
    isn't actually useful, we need to use the -auth command-line parameter
    instead.  Somehow this seems to have been broken all these years and
    nobody noticed...

      odds of having a server built against multiarched mesa, installed
      along a pre-multiarch mesa. The Breaks in mesa packages take care of
      the other way round already.
    + And since the server's binNMU managed to migrate to testing way too
      early, add a Breaks against pre-multiarch libgl1-mesa-dri and
      libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental.
    + Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2 (no changes).
    + Add Breaks on drivers abandoned between lenny and squeeze.  This helps

  * Unfuzzy all patches.
  * Get rid of long obsolete NEWS file.
  * Replace “--remaining-packages” with “-Nfoo -Nbar” in the “dh_strip -s”
    call, to avoid non-stripped binaries if the build is resumed.
  * Use “dh_prep” instead of deprecated “dh_clean -k”.
  * Bump debhelper build-dep accordingly.
  * Introduce dh_xsf_substvars, to be used in driver packages to set
    appropriate substitution variables for Depends and Provides, before
    calling dh_gencontrol. Ship it in xserver-xorg-dev.
  * Also ship a debhelper sequence: xsf.pm, to insert dh_xsf_substvars
    before dh_gencontrol. Usage: “dh $@ --with xsf” when using dh.
  * Get rid of inputabiver and videoabiver files, they've been deprecated
    for a while, and drivers should all have switched by now.
  * rules: Only read the first line of debian/serverminver to set the
    serverminver variable, used to prepare xinputdep and videodrvdep
    files.
  * rules: Keep only the major ABI version from pkg-config's output to
    build xorg-{input,video}-abi-$ABI. To handle minor ABI versions, we
    have the serverminver mechanism.
  * To avoid having to binNMU all drivers to update their Depends from
    xorg-*-abi-$MAJOR-$MINOR to xorg-*-abi-$MAJOR, add xorg-video-abi-8.0
    and xorg-input-abi-11.0 to the server's Provides temporarily (until
    the next ABI bump).
  * Add ${videoabi}, ${inputabi} to the udeb's Provides. There's no reason
    for udebs to have loose dependencies.
  * Accordingly, copy server's substvars as udeb's substvars once the
    videoabi/inputabi variables are computed.
  * Add an abibumpcheck target which checks for xinput and videodrv ABI
    updates, based on the versions stored in debian/serverminver; make
    clean depend on it to make sure such an update is noticed at the very
    beginning of the build.
  * Add current versions to debian/serverminver accordingly.
  * Remove “xserver” from Provides, it's deprecated.
  * Use architecture wildcards for build-deps.
  * Make xserver-xfbdev linux-any; add armhf and powerpcspe to the udeb

    - Check for obsolete libraries in the same way (/usr/X11R6/lib might
      still exist in some cases, and be referenced in /etc/ld.so.conf, so

  * Add support for “noudeb” in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to disable building the

    and libudev support from xserver 1.8. Replaces the patches we had

    input device configuration straight to the long term solution
    introduced in 1.8.
  * Add 11-xfree86-fix-video-fallback.diff from SUSE. Allows the video
    fallback method to work when there's an xorg.conf around.
  * Add 12-xfree86-dont-complain-about-missing-coredevices.diff.
    No reason to complain about these, unless AEI is off.
  * Add 13-unbreak-input-abi.diff. Keep the old NewInputDeviceRequest(),
    rename the new as NIDR18() and call it from NIDR(). This way we
    don't break the input ABI.
  * Add 14-tone-down-nidr-errors.diff. Use X_INFO instead of X_ERROR.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * 15-keep-udev-x11-driver.diff: keep looking for the x11_driver udev
    property as a transitional measure.  This should allow the new server to

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Pass -DPRE_RELEASE=0 in CPPFLAGS, so we don't print the pre-release
    warning in the Xorg log.
  * Pull from upstream server-1.4-branch
    + drop patch 40_default_dpi_96.patch applied upstream
    + refresh patches 03_auto_load_driver.diff and
      04_auto_load_driver_no_conf.diff
  * Don't build-depend on packages with a -1 debian revision.
  * Drop the XS- prefix from Vcs-* control fields.
  * Add x11-common to the Depends field of xnest, xvfb and xserver-xephyr (its
    init script sets up the /tmp/.X11-unix directory).
  * Re-enable the dmx DDX, and build the xdmx and xdmx-tools packages (the
    build is now fixed upstream); closes: #449254.

  [ Drew Parsons ]
  * Patch 95_xprint_disable_dbus disables dbus in Xprint by providing
    dummy config functions. Taken from upstream commit
    2a3d1421e0cc18822ae8f478fcc272e16a9e9340, with removal of
    CONFIG_LIB from configure.ac shifted to 94_xprint_XSERVER_LIBS.
    Closes: #472180.
  * Enable the xprint DDX, and build the xprint and xprint-common packages.

    spotting all these ugly bits
    + Newline after #else when picking the driver (this is the failsafe
      choice)
    + Change by hacked "ids" file name suffix check to use strncmp and check
      for ".ids"
    + Use strncpy instead of strncat unnecessarily
  * Add support for a partially configured device section
    Implemented in 03_autoload_driver.diff. Now if you have a device section
    but lack a driver, it'll use the settings. This will allow you to just
    have a device section and enable EXA but not have to specify the driver or
    anything else.
  * Add 07_autoconfig_screen_with_device_section.diff
    This patch allows the Screen section to not specify a device section. If
    this happens, the server will automatically use the first device section
    listed in the xorg.conf instead

    the driver itself provides in /usr/share/xserver-xorg/pci. If no driver
    claims the PCI ID of your primary video card, then it will choose a
    fallback based on your system.

    capabilities for the server that may be overrided easily. Previously the

    specified in the xorg.conf, or if you didn't have a xorg.conf at all. This
    patch provides a default set and you can add only the "Load" instructions
    to xorg.conf that you want without losing the defaults. Similarly, if you
    don't want to load a module that's loaded by default, you can add
    "Disable modulename" to your xorg.conf (see man xorg.conf in this release
    for details). See upstream bug #10541 for more.

  * Disable the explicit enabling of dri in the configure. The configure

    explicitly breaks the build on hurd. Thanks Samuel Thibault and Michael
    Banck. Closes: #358015

    an alternate path in their xorg.conf file via the ModulePath option. A
