haskell-x11 (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Closes: #454440.
  * Upgrade to "Generic Haskell cabal library packaging files v10":
    * Versioned dependencies are now generated for the Cabal packages we
      depend on.
    * Use the new ${impl:ghc6:*_deps} variables in debian/control.in.
    * Call canonicalise-comma-list on the depends and suggests fields in
      control.in. This works around bugs in lintian, where it gets
      confused and starts giving spurious warnings.

      that it exists) after "Setup copy"ing the Cabal package.
    * Remove some hacks that worked around older Cabal not letting us
      tell it exactly where to put the documentation.
    * Use --hyperlink-source when telling Cabal to haddock the library.
    * Add hscolour to the build-depends.

      update-debian-haskell-files.
    * Build-dep on haddock >= 0.8-2 in order to get portable .haddock files.
    * We tell Cabal's configure where to put the docs so that it doesn't
      break when we move them around behind its back.

  * Upgrade to "Generic Haskell cabal library debian/rules v0.6".
    Tell setup to use ghc6 rather than ghc, so that the postinst/prerm
    scripts work when the ghc-pkg symlink doesn't exist or doesn't
