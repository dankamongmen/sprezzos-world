    rb_str_modify_expand@Base.
  * debian/run-test-suites.bash:

  [ Daigo Moriwaki ]
  * debian/control: Corrected wording. (Closes: #624574)

  [ Lucas Nussbaum ]
  * Change 01_default_gem_path.diff:
    + executables are now installed to /usr/local/bin.
    + but the other files created by rubygems stay in /var/lib/gems/.
    Several commenters in #448639 and #403407 argued in favor of the switch to
    /usr/local/bin. Those two bugs can therefore be closed. However, the issue
    is not completely solved, as rubygems still installs files in
    /var/lib/gems.
    Nobody in the bug logs explained why that was an issue. If you care about
    it, please open a new bug. Fixes the rubygems bugs: #448639, #403407
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.2. No changes needed.

  [ Lucas Nussbaum ]
  * New upstream release. The 1.9.2 branch was in deep freeze at the time of
    the last snapshot, and all the changes between that snapshot and the
    present final tarball are bugfixes, as shown by
    svn log -r28788:HEAD http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/branches/ruby_1_9_2
    Also, it sounds much easier to support a released version on the long
    term, rather than an SVN snapshot.
    Also fixes CVE-2010-0541. Closes: #593298.
    Could also improve kFreeBSD support as some changes are FreeBSD-related.
  * Add build-dependency on libyaml-dev to build psych, which is a new, faster
    YAML library provided in Ruby 1.9.2.

  [ Daigo Moriwaki ]
  * debian/watch: support new URL for Ruby 1.9.2.
  * debian/rules: DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="nordoc" provides no-doc build for
    build testing.
  * Merged rubygems1.9.1: this package used to be provided by the libgems-ruby
    source package, but the version of rubygems provided by libgems-ruby is
    incompatible with Ruby 1.9.2. Also, Rubygems is shipped as part of Ruby.

  * Add disable-tests.diff: disable some tests that cause failures on FreeBSD.
    Closes: #590002, #543805, #542927.
  * However, many new failures on FreeBSD. Since that version is still an
    improvement, add the check that makes test suite failures non-fatal on

  * Re-add 903_skip_base_ruby_check.dpatch

    standard library.  WEBrick lets attackers to inject malicious escape
    sequences to its logs, making it possible for dangerous control characters
    to be executed on a victim's terminal emulator. (Closes: #564646)

    are two solutions:
    - keep gem1.9 in ruby1.9, and merge back rdoc1.9. This cause people

ruby1.9 (1.9.0+20060423-3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Make mkconfig.rb understand autoconf >2.59a's new way of doing
    config.status; it inserts #|_!!_|# into the sed lines temporarily, then
    removes them at the end. Since mkconfig.rb only parses these lines instead
    of executing the entire sed script, it has to remove #|_!!_|# by itself.
    This fixes FTBFS with newer autoconf. (Closes: #373953)
