  * Relabel "Twidddler" as "Handykey Twiddler" everywhere.
    For years I figured it was a cute marketing name.  Nope, just a typo.
  * gpm.config: if gpm.conf specifies at least 'type' and 'device', use it
    to preseed all fields; otherwise don't use it at all.  Previously we
    preseeded only non-empty values, which breaks if a gpm.conf value
    (such as repeat_type) is empty intentionally.  (Closes: #307638)

  * Added French debconf translation. (Closes: #268111)
    Thanks to Christian Perrier <bubulle@debian.org>.
  * Reintroduce conditional gpm_has_mouse_control use in postinst.
  * Make gpm responsive again on some notebooks by start and stopping
    on apm resume/suspend cycles. (Closes: #273501, #105842)
  * Make libgpm less verbose to not print error messages when the
    required devices cannot be opened. (Closes: #139533, #168116)
  * Merged patches:
    - debian/patches/011_debuglog_fix_000: Moved into ...
    - debina/patches/001_logging_000: ... here.
  * Removed unneeded Build-Depends on libncurses5-dev.

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * Add lintian source overrides for prerm/postrm not having debhelper
    hooks.  Unfortunately, dh_installinit does the wrong thing there.
  * postinst: 'test -e' fails for dangling symlink, use 'test -h' as well.
    (Closes: #268766)
  * Added Czech debconf translation.  (Closes: #275336)
    Thanks to Jan Outrata <outrataj@upcase.inf.upol.cz>
  * Configure --without-curses.  Apparently nobody uses libgpm curses
    support.  This made it awkward for ncurses to be compiled with libgpm
    support, which is apparently much more useful.  (Closes: #274673)

gpm (1.19.6-17) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * Add po/da.po from Claus Hindsgaul. (Closes: #267549)
  * Fix shell quoting on 'append'.  It would be ugly to do it as it was
    done before, AFAICT, but the new version should work like the old one,
    at least.  (Closes: #267478)
  * Fix init script bug which has been present since hamm:
    the append= in gpm.conf uses a quoted string of args which themselves
    might be quoted and need to be unquoted.  "eval" does this.  The
    practical effect is that systems installed from hamm or slink will no
    longer consider " to be a word character.  It was never intended to be
    one, but has been for 6 years.

gpm (1.19.6-15) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * gpm.config: Fix (harmless) warning if gpm.conf doesn't exist.
  * gpm.postrm: move debhelper stuff to the beginning of the script.
    Seems to work around debconf weirdness that causes an error exit.
    (Closes: #266942)
  * gpm.init: make "repeat_type=none" do what the debconf template
    says it does.  Thanks to Gian Piero Carrubba.  (Closes: #266841)
  * gpm.prerm: rewrite stop_gpm() to fix 3 bugs and improve readability:
    - space after \ line continuation char
    - 'gpm -x' should be 'gpm -k'
    - return success, not failure, if the daemon wasn't running
    (Closes: #266937)
  * gpm.postinst: only set up /dev/mouse if it doesn't already exist.
    It should not ever be needed anyway, and breaks the occasional
    config.  Also teach it about repeat_type=none and multi-level
    device names like /dev/input/mice.  (Closes: #266983)
  * gpm.init: minor UI issues:
    - print newlines after errors on start / stop targets
    - if stop failed on restart, do not bother to 'sleep 3'
    - propagate start failure on restart
  * gpm.templates: Reword gpm/restart so as not to imply that the user
    *is* necessarily in X.  We actually do not know this at the time.

  [ Guillem Jover ]
  * Switched to ucf, so no more user configuration changes trashed on
    update. (Closes: #266822)
  * Removed debconf question about fixing an old bogus gpm.conf file
    generated with gpmconfig.

  [ Joshua Kwan ]
  * Add Peter Samuelson to uploaders.
  * Remove unused 'read' patch, and 'sources' file.

    existence first.

    o Added new repeater type, ms3, includes wheel data!!
    o Added wheel parsing stuff to ms3 type. (IntelliMouse SERIAL)
    o Added new type, xmiabps2, for the Kensington Mouse-in-a-box in ps2

      parsing to it..
