_Description: Prepare /etc/resolv.conf for dynamic updates?
 The resolvconf package contains the infrastructure required for
 dynamic updating of the resolver configuration file. Part of the
 necessary infrastructure is a symbolic link from /etc/resolv.conf to
 /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf. If you choose this option then this
 link will be created; the existing /etc/resolv.conf file will be
 preserved as /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original, and will be
 restored if this package is removed.
 .
 Declining this option will prevent future installations from
 recreating the symbolic link and therefore the resolver configuration
 file will not be dynamically updated. Dynamic updating can then be
 activated following instructions in the README file.
 .
 The presence of resolvconf can affect the behavior of other programs,
 so it should not be left installed if unconfigured.

Template: resolvconf/downup-interfaces
Type: note
_Description: Reboot recommended
 Suppliers of name server information such as local caching name
 servers and interface configurers are expected to supply name server
 information to the resolvconf program. However, although
 installation of the resolvconf package triggers them to supply
 their information, some of them fail to do so.
 .
 This bug would lead to loss of valid name server information on
 installation of the resolvconf package if the following workaround
 were not adopted: resolvconf includes the full contents of the
 pre-installation /etc/resolv.conf in its database until reboot.
 This has the drawback that name server information is retained
 even if the associated interface is later deconfigured. (This
 incorrect behavior is judged to be less harmful than the alternative
 of losing valid information.)
 .
 Until the bug in question is fixed and the workaround removed,
 the only way to ensure that resolvconf has fully correct name server
 information after the resolvconf package has been installed on a
 running system is to reboot the system.

Type: note
_Description: Reboot recommended
 The removal of the resolvconf package may have resulted in some
 information about name servers becoming unavailable. To correct
 this problem it is recommended that the system be rebooted.

Template: resolvconf/link-tail-to-original
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Append original file to dynamic file?
 If the original static resolver configuration file (/etc/resolv.conf)
 contains name server addresses, those addresses should be listed on
 "dns-nameservers" lines in /etc/network/interfaces. For more
 information, please consult the resolvconf(8) man page and the
 README file.
 .
 Until /etc/network/interfaces has been edited and the affected
 interfaces brought down and up again, the name server addresses will
 not be included in the dynamically generated resolver configuration
 file.
 .
 If you choose this option, a temporary workaround will be put in
 place: a symbolic link will be created (if it does not already exist)
 from /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail to
 /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original. This will cause the whole of
 that original resolver configuration file to be appended to the
 dynamically generated file.
 .
 After the required "dns-nameservers" lines have been added to
 /etc/network/interfaces, the /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail link
 should be replaced by one to /dev/null.
