Description: A desktop experience that sings
 Unity is a desktop experience that sings. Designed by Canonical and the
 Ayatana community, Unity is all about the combination of familiarity and the
 future. The Unity desktop experience is designed to allow for multiple
 implementations, currently, Unity consists of a Compiz plugin based visual
 interface only, which is heavily dependent on OpenGL.
