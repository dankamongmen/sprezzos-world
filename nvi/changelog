    warning debhelper-but-no-misc-depends.

  * Create/fix /var/tmp/vi.recover in postinst (closes: #207720)
  * Take more care in handling of recovery files in nviboot. The nviboot

    owner(BSD user groups). Patch from Gianluca Di Corato. I still think

  * Change default escapetime to 3 (10ths of seconds) (closes: #137424)
  * Detect files > 2Gb and exit, instead of saying "new file" (closes: #111445)
