Description: Efficient parsing of LocalTime using C's strptime
 This library provides a binding to strptime, that allows one to parse dates and
 times from strings and strict/lazy bytestrings. The library creates LocalTime
 values. It provides some extra features which the original strptime lacks -
 parsing of fractional seconds and parsing of ten-powers of seconds since epoch
 (for example milliseconds since epoch).
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.

Description: Efficient parsing of LocalTime using C's strptime; profiling libraries
 This library provides a binding to strptime, that allows one to parse dates and
 times from strings and strict/lazy bytestrings. The library creates LocalTime
 values. It provides some extra features which the original strptime lacks -
 parsing of fractional seconds and parsing of ten-powers of seconds since epoch
 (for example milliseconds since epoch).
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
