Description: reifies arbitrary terms into types that can be reflected back into terms
 This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the
 paper "Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations" by Oleg Kiselyov and
 Chung-chieh Shan. However, the API has been streamlined to improve
 performance.
