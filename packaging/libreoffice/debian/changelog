      want/need it

    - install mono-ooo.pc into libuno-cil

      effect when -l10n-* isn't there and the UI is switched to
      that language. By the way this closes: #258841

    - WITH_AGG=n; not used in OOo yet (although built-in), just in the source
      because of "internal [Sun] reasons..."
    - stop adding ($(BUILDER)) to OOO_VENDOR. It ends up only in the res files

      and appears on all archs (also if they've been built on the buildd) which

      the libcu*.so.26 symlinks here. See #393597.
    - once again, change the Mozilla suggestions (this time also in the
      package descriptions): remove all transitional packages except
      thunderbird (still "normal" in testing), add icedove in front of
      "thunderbird". Keep mozilla-browser since it's still present in unstable.
    - Analogous with the xlibmesa-gl | libgl1 suggestion, just keep libgl1
    - remove oooqs-kde Suggests since we conflict against it anyway now

      the end. (to be removed)

    - move gcj classmap creation into the right conditional
    - fix clean target for ooo-build changes

    - fix no-java build (don't try to move around writer2latex.jar)
    - enable packaging of -qa-* (requested by OOo QA) and fix README.qa
      installation
    - remove .testtoolrc installing at all (seems to be a sneaked-in file);
      rm -f it when it should appear
    - add USE_GSTREAMER conditional (gstreamer support for avmedia is

      that's what meant and using ${base-version} breaks with the ~ semantics
    - remove -gtks conflicts and fix it's description
    - remove build-dep on tcsh

  * new upstream milestone m179 on the way to OOo 2.0.4
  * since we upload to experimental, which has python 2.4 as default
    we can as well build against 2.4 now (closes: #336284)
  * ooo-build:
    - use HEAD
    - apply xmlhelp-use-libxslt-from-system.diff again; crashes supposedly
      fixed
    - src: GSI updates for SRC680 from ftp.linux.cz
  * debian/control.in:
    - bump python-dev builddep to (>= 2.4) as the experimental buildds
      otherwise won't pick it up from exeperimental, version python and
      python-minimal (newly added) ones, too since iirc the experimental
      buildds still won't take it otherwise. To be removed again when this
      goes to sid.

    - make -writer provide writer2latex

  * debian/rules:
    - use i586-mingw32msvc-g++ now as unowinreg is now a .cxx with extern "C"'s

      time this is in experimental. Will be disabled for sid again.
    - (re-)add USE_LIBXSLT conditional, enable it
    - move mobile devices filters (AportisDoc, Pocket{Word,Excel} into an own
      package

      it for now because it crashes

    - revert %U -> %F change, breaks opening of remote files

        either.
  * debian/control.in, debian/control.gcj.in, debian/rules: disable -gcj
    build, the wizards don't work with it installed. move -gcj into

      hunspell replaced myspell and we really don't need to link with

      disable it per default, though due to its size (324 MB deb, 1 GB i-s)

  * patches/src680/sparc-bridges-use-g++-3.4.diff: add hack to use g++-3.4 for
    the sparc bridges
  * ooo-build/src: translation updates
  * build also ttf-opensymbol
  * ooo-build/bin/package-ooo: don't install a wrapper script for jvmsetup
    which doesn't exist anymore (closes: #324160)
  * debian/control*in:
    - let -core conflict against openoffice.org2-l10n-1.9.1{08,14,21,25}.
      Needs better automatic solution...
    - let the langpacks conflict against the numerical previous and next
      -langpack versions
    - only Recommend openoffice.org-core, analogous to 1.1.x to make
      tasksel happy
    - add ${cli:Depends} to libuno-cil
    - Suggest c-shell at -dev to make lintian happy
    - add @LOCALES_DEPENDS@
    - add libmythes-dev
    - build-depend on libicu34-dev
    - readd unixodbc-dev builddeps for Debian
    - add Conflicts:/Provides:/Replaces: against the old packages where
      appropriate and needed
    - build-depend on g++-3.4 on sparc
    - really remove -base dependency on -gnome
    - only set a binsuffix when $(VER) is not empty; otherwise build
      with --with-binsuffix=no
    - change build-dependency against libcurl from libcurl3-dev to
      libcurl3-openssl-dev | libcurl3-dev to cope with the reorganization of
      the curl packages
  * debian/rules:
    - run dh_desktop...
    - suggest culmus for a prospective -he langpack
    - use -s instead of -a in binary-arch
    - fix installation of mono stuff (don't install the .dlls into -common...)
      and set MONO_SHARED_DIR for dh_clideps
    - chmod 755 setsdkenv_unix.*
    - do classmap creation, taken from eclipse, thanks. Still no effect,
      though...
    - enable cairo canvas build, disabled per default though
    - add extra sysui build step back because of changed upstream behaviour
    - enable rw, it doesn't work with "locales" but with
      "belocs-locales-data", so add a new LOCALES_DEPENDS variable letting
      it depending on belocs-locales-data and "the rest" on
      "locales | belocs-locales-data". Same for the other languages not
      supported by plain locales.
    - disable bs and lt, somehow doesn't work anymore, to be investigated
    - add preliminary support for builds without Java; useful for backports
      or for archs where Java still make problems
    - add the possibility to build a non-PIC version of libmythes here and
      to package libmythes-dev from here (if $(USE_EXTERNAL_MYTHES) != "y").
      Use that, updates of mythes would need a rebuild of OOo anyway so this
      is quite overkill.. Requested by Martin Pitt.
    - remove ooonologo installation, now done via ooo-build patch
    - add manpage symlink for ooffice, thanks Matthias Klose
    - add conditional to optionally build without STLport and use the "normal"
      STL.
    - add system-icu and system-xmlsec conditionals; enable both
    - move psprint.conf and sofficerc into /etc/openoffice; add a dummy
      sofficrc just referencing /etc/openoffice/sofficerc in ../program to
      make OOo work...
    - Remove the "<app> makes it possible" from the German desktop
      translations.
    - install (and create) GNOME .keys, .mime and .applications
    - install DicOOo
    - install dictionary.lst symlink (closes: #320831)
    - disable --with-system-sablot; breaks displaying of help, thanks Matthias
      Klose
    - export JAVA_HOME in debian/rules; otherwise the registration of
      the Java compponent somehow fail
    - several updates for 1.9.x -> 2.0; get desktop-integration version
      from productversion.mk directlay instead of from the changelog
    - use ooo-build-2-0 branch
    - if we build without Java, run the Javadoc buildstep manually and
      copy the files in install-indep; otherwise -dev-doc (_all) would
      eventually miss the Javadocs depending on where it was build...
  * debian/copyright: update FSF address, thanks lintian
  * debian/*.overrides.lintian: update; override rpath warnings globally since
    we have different files with different names on the different archs and
    override csh-considered-harmful.

  * debian/shlibs.override.internal: override also libxmlsec1-nss
  * debian/copyright: update for new LGPL-only licensing and refer to

  * debian/shell-lib.sh: add conffile handling (remove, move)
  * debian/openoffice.org-common.preinst.in: remove
    /etc/bash_completion.d/openoffice; obsoleted by
    /etc/bash_completion.d/ooo-wrapper.sh and
    /etc/openoffice/autoresponse.conf (obsolete because there's no "setup"
    anymore)
  * debian/ttf-opensymbol.postinst.in: don't run fc-cache if fontconfig
    was not yet configured (closes: #303693)

openoffice.org2 (1.9.125-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Update to m125 (aka 2.0beta2)
    - does not stat any font twice anymore on cold startup (closes: #243659)
  * ooo-build/src:
    - translation updates from ftp.linux.cz again; get bg from
      wget http://icobgr.info/ooo/GSI_bg.sdf.bz2 directly since ftp.linux.cz's
      version is broken
  * debian/rules:
    - enable hunspell component. Fix to specify -Nopenoffice.org2-hunspell
      when we don't enable it. Fix typo preventing libhunspell-dev actually
      be added to %BUILD_DEPS%
    - generate setsdk_unix.{,c}sh
    - add mysql.jar, sapdbc-7.5.00.jar and postgresql.jar (from libmysql-java /
      libsapdbc7.5.01-java / libpg-java) to the CLASSPATH
    - remove stale SUGGESTS from debian/rules control. Exchange it with
      FONT_SUGGESTS; for now adding ttf-{bengali,gujarati,punjabi}-fonts to
      the Suggests of -bn / -pa-in / -gu-IN.
    - add debian/rules to the dependencies of the control target. debian/rules
      changes can make debian/control change, too (conditionals,
      @FONT_SUGGESTS@)
    - since ooo-build now has system-mdbtools implemented, add conditional for
      this; enable mdbtools support and build with system mdbtools
    - update cairo conditional
    - add missing , to some BUILD_DEPS settings
    - bump kdelibs4-dev builddep to >= 3.4.2 since there KDE has transitioned;
      eclipcitely build-dep on libgamin-dev to work around install problems
      with GNOME, thanks Adeodato Simo for the workaround and hint. Enable it.
    - handle gzip compressed GSIs
    - some conditional cleanup for Ubuntu, add BUILD_AMD64 conditional
    - fix typo in opens___.ttf installing
    - uncomment LD_ASSUME_KERNEL call, was uncommented for testing and then
      not re-enabled again....
    - the mono support is now enabled per default in ooo-build; disable it
      (still needs the .dll's from the OOo windows installset)
    - build hicontrast iconset
    - install libkab1.so into -kde
  * debian/control*.in:
    - add openoffice.org2-hunspell
    - -dev Recommends: java-gcj-compat-dev
    - Suggest also libmysql-java | libpg-java | libsapdbc7.5.01-java
      (JDBC Drivers) at -base
    - Suggest g++-4.0 | g++-3.4 at -dev instead of the other way round,
      request of Mattias Klose
    - let -base Depend on java-gcj-compat | j2re1.4 | java2-runtime insteadf
      of just Recommending it since the internal db needs it. Recommend
      java-gcj-compat | j2re1.4 | java2-runtime on -writer for the
      Java-needing features. Substitute gij-4.0 dependency on -jars-native
      with java-gcj-compat, too
    - let -core Conflict against openoffice.orgVER-unbundled (provided by the
      official OOo packages from Sun) to prevent a openoffice.org-writer
      sneaking in which would fullfill our dependencies when these packages
      are openoffice.org-* but wouldn't work at all together with "the rest"
      of our packages. Provide openoffice.orgVER-bundled as the counterpart -
      the packages from Sun conflict against it.
    - add @FONT_SUGGESTS@
    - s/myspell-dictionary-@CODE@/myspell-dictionary-@LCODE@/, oops
    - add Architecture: all to ttf-opensymbol...
    - remove unixodbc builddeps for Debian, unixodbc-dev uninstallable
    - add %AMD64%, substituted by amd64 if we want to build amd64, too
    - Standards-Version: 3.6.2 (no changes needed)
    - mention KDE Addressbook integration at -kde and Suggest kaddressbook
    - temporaryily let -common depend on -l10n-en-us until some package split
      issues are sorted out...
  * debian/*.overrides.lintian: add lintian overrides
     - binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath, we use RPATH to OOo own dir; makes sense
       here
     - menu-icon-missing, bogus warning, the icons are in -common and not
       in -writer, -calc, etc
     - menu-item-contains-unknown-tag, kderemove="y" *is* a valid tag
  * debian/javasettings*xml: remove, useless

    - improve GSI extraction; do not fail if there are no GSIs to merge,
      thanks Martin Kretzschmar
    - don't install th_gen_idx.pl anymore; we have it in libmythes-dev already

      Request by Matthias Klose.
    - ooo-build now has --enable-cairo as default, disable it
    - add conditional for the new mdbtools-using Access import stuff but
      disable it for now
    - readd lang= handling as known from 1.1.x to build only one language
    - system-hsqldb is now conditional in ooo-build; add appropriate
      conditional here, too to use it and set the right (build-)depends
    - copy the icons from -debian-menus, not from the redhat one.
      Don't do a extra sysui build step anymore since that's not needed
      anymore.
    - add pyuno conditionals, the pyuno build is disabled on amd64..
    - add conditional for hunspell support, don't enable it yet

  * Recompiled against fixed libstlport package
  * Change user directory to ~/OpenOffice.org1.0.1.  Note there is 
    *no support* from upstream to upgrade the user directory, and I have seen
     too much corruption from 1.0.0 to be prepared to attempt to support it in
     just these packages, so you must change your user settings by hand for
     now.  The openoffice wrapper will warn if it sees ~/.openoffice still.
  * Update some sections of README

openoffice.org (1.0.0-pre1.0.1rc1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream: 1.0.1 release candidate
      (from CVS OpenOffice_1_0_1 of 7/3/2002)
  * Jan- Hendrik Palic:
    - Switched to gcc-3.1/g++3.1 to build OpenOffice.org on PPC.  i386 does
      not work with gcc-3.1 yet.
    - much work on the patches:
      + all changes to oo_1.0_src/config_office/configure.in went to
        001_configure.in_gcc-3.x-fixes.diff
         o set compilervars
         o detecting the right include for gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
         o java will be detected right on powerpc, so we can build
           automaticly, without setting the location of javac twice
      + link against -lstlport_gcc_3.1 (soname changed in libstlport)
        this went into 011_link_agains_stlport_gcc_3.1.diff
      + 005_gcc3_misc_changes.diff did the last changes to compile
        OpenOffice.org by gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
      + 010_use_libstdc++_from_debian.diff is changed to use this patch with
        OpenOffice.org-1.0.1
    - debian/rules:
      + copies the mozlibs into source from some place (sorry,no package yet)
        but I will link OpenOffice.org again mozilla 1.0 from debian
        (I have to recompile Mozilla with gcc-3.1/g++3.1)
    - debian/control
      + fixes the builddependencies for using gcc-3.1/g++-3.1 for all arches.
      + added buildconflict to libgcj3-dev
    - killed extra-dependencies on debian/script/vars.powerpc
    - sets USE_GCC3 to y in debian/script/vars.powerpc
    - changed debian/rules to use gcc-3.1
  * Chris Halls
    - Fix errors like openoffice: [: it-CH: binary operator expected
    - Remove patches integrated upstream:
       008_clk_tck_gcc-3.diff, 015_setup_oognomeappmath.diff,
       016_fontcache_copy_weight.diff, 021_lingu_cvsupdates.diff,
       022_psprint_fontmanager.diff
    - New patch: 015_dont_unset_home.diff - removes unset HOME so ccache works
      again
    - Properly detect GNOME2 session manager, thanks to Gary Coady
    - Remove languages from oo-xlate-lang that are not yet available
      (ca and fi)
    - link against -lstlport_gcc_3.x (soname changed in libstlport) - this was
      one of the showstoppers for getting OOo into main.  Correct lib is
      determined from the compiler in use
    - Fix patch.unapply to work with arch dir
    - Make patch.apply pipe *.uu patches through uudecode for binary patches
    - set SAL_DEBUG=strace or gdb for debugging
    - move global dictionary.lst into /etc/openoffice
    - openoffice.org Suggests openoffice.org-spellcheck
    - ooo-l10n-de Suggests German dictionaries

openoffice.org (1.0.0-6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix names of suggested ooqstart-gnome and update-mime
  * Revert 903_system_freetype.diff - the OpenSymbol font can not be displayed
    unless you use a font server, which means most users will not be able to
    use bullets.  This appears to be some problem with the different
    libfreetype versions.  Spadmin will crash if you try to add the
    OpenSymbol font directly, and I cannot see what is going on in gdb without
    creating a debug build.
  * Move libmozab libraries to -bin package

 -- Chris Halls <chris.halls@gmx.de>  Tue, 25 Jun 2002 17:57:22 +0200

    - 903_system_freetype.diff
          + Use the system libfreetype instead of the internal library
