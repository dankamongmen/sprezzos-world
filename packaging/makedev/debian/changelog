  * one more tweak to the udev detection
  * put $tty back to 0666, use it for /dev/tty (instead of $public which is

    turns out I already fixed the /dev/tty[0-9]* permissions way back in -59,
    we just hadn't done anything in postinst to force them tighter on upgrade,
    ergo the confusion in -67 and -68.  [large sigh]
  * MAKEDEV creates /dev/tty[0-9]* as 0600, and mesg wiggles the group write 
    bit, so make the postinst do 'chmod g-r,o= /dev/tty[0-9]*' instead of "o="
