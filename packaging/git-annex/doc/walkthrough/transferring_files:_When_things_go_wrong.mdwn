After a while, you'll have several annexes, with different file contents.
You don't have to try to keep all that straight; git-annex does 
[[location_tracking]] for you. If you ask it to get a file and the drive
or file server is not accessible, it will let you know what it needs to get
it:

	# git annex get video/hackity_hack_and_kaxxt.mov
	get video/_why_hackity_hack_and_kaxxt.mov (not available)
	  Unable to access these remotes: usbdrive, server
	  Try making some of these repositories available:
	  	5863d8c0-d9a9-11df-adb2-af51e6559a49  -- my home file server
	   	58d84e8a-d9ae-11df-a1aa-ab9aa8c00826  -- portable USB drive
	   	ca20064c-dbb5-11df-b2fe-002170d25c55  -- backup SATA drive
	failed
	# sudo mount /media/usb
	# git annex get video/hackity_hack_and_kaxxt.mov
	get video/hackity_hack_and_kaxxt.mov (from usbdrive...) ok
