Description: simple interprocess messaging system (GLib interface)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides a GLib-style interface to D-Bus.
 .
 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (GLib library debug symbols)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides support for debugging programs that use the GLib-based
 shared library.
 .
