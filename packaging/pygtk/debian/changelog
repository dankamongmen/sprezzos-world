  * debian/rules: Don't call dh_numpy when building on Ubuntu, to avoid

  * Stop build-depending on libgl1-mesa-dri, it was a workaround.
    Instead, require an Xvfb that isn't problematic. Closes: #524543.

  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * 10_maintainer_mode: define AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to avoid re-running 
    the autotools during the build process.
  * 70_autoconf.patch renamed to 70_autotools.patch: run the whole 
    autotools stack, not just autoconf.
  * Together, closes: #527858.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Pass PYTHON to $(MAKE) runs for robustness in case of timestamp skews; see
    #509192; thanks Colin Watson for the original patch.
  * Don't purge /usr/share/doc/python-gtk2-doc/examples/demos during first
    configuration.
  * Rework patch and config.sub/.guess handling: backup config.guess and .sub,
    call quilt instead of relying on cdbs' quilt patchsys, restore
    config.guess and .sub after unpatching.  This avoids config.guess and
    .subin the diff, and allows control over fully working and fully patched
    trees.
  * Don't strip python-gtk2-dbg.
  * Rework install rules and dependencies completely to avoid .PHONY implicit
    targets.

  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * 65_bogus-python-includes.patch: patch from Loïc Minier. Don’t 
    override PYTHON_INCLUDES, already set by AM_CHECK_PYTHON_HEADERS.
    Closes: #512345.
  * 70_autoconf.patch: refreshed.
  * Only recommend python-numpy, it can be detected at runtime.
  * Install files to the python-support directory so that the debugging 
    symbols are usable.
  * Fix quilt invocation so that patches are applied.

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * Merge -dbg packages and running the test suite from Ubuntu,
    thanks to Sebastien Bacher:
    - debian/control.in:
      + Build-depend on python-all-dbg
      + Add python-gtk2-dbg and python-glade2-dbg packages. Closes: #470805.
      + python-gtk2 suggests python-gtk2-dbg
      + Build-depend on xvfb, needed to run make check during the build.
    - debian/rules:
      + Add -dbg magic.
      + Run the test suite.
    - debian/python-gtk2-dev.install:
      + Install pygtk-codegen-2.0, which will try to launch
        pygobject-codegen-2.0. This is for backwards compatibility.
    - debian/python-gtk2-doc.install:
      + Install pygtk-demo.

  * Merge new upstream release and fixes from Ubuntu, thanks to Loïc Minier:
    - debian/control.in:
      + Require libgtk2.0-dev >= 2.13.6 and python-gobject-dev >= 2.15.3.
      + Build-depend on xauth, xfonts-base, needed by xvfb, and on
        libgl1-mesa-dri too, until Xvfb can start without AIGLX support or it
        depends on this package.
      + Build-depend on gnome-icon-theme, since some buildds might have
        optical drives which require a special icon in the file chooser
        (needed for the test suite).
    - debian/patches/10_use-default-python.patch:
      + Removed, codegen copy has been dropped from pygtk.
    - debian/patches/50_wakeupfd-curruption.patch:
      + Removed, fixed upstream.
    - debian/python-gtk2-dev.install,
      debian/rules:
      + Drop all codegen related code.
    - debian/rules:
      + Change permission fixup constructs (chmod 755) to use xargs and not
        run if nothing has to be fixed.

  * debian/control.in:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0.
    - Move Homepage to its own field.
    - python-glade2 suggests python-glade2-dbg.
    - Add Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Svn fields.
    - python-gtk2-doc depends on python:Depends and python-gtk2,
      needed for pygtk-demo.
    - python-gtk2-doc recommends python-gobject and python-cairo, needed
      by some examples.
    - python-gtk2-doc recommends python-glade2 for the examples, instead
      of suggest it.
    - Add XB-Python-Version to python-gtk2-doc per Python policy.
  * debian/python-gtk2-doc.install:
    - Install examples needed by pygtk-demo in /usr/lib/pygtk/2.0
      (their original place) so that pygtk-demo doesn't rely on
      /usr/share/doc being available.
  * debian/python-gtk2-doc.links,
    debian/python-gtk2-doc.preinst:
    - Link /usr/share/doc/python-gtk2-doc/examples/demos to /usr/lib/pygtk/2.0
      so that examples are still available in /usr/share/doc.
    - Make sure /usr/share/doc/python-gtk2-doc/examples/demos doesn't exist
      before upgrading to 2.13.0-1, so that the link is successfully created.
  * debian/rules:
    - Call dh_pysupport for python-gtk2-doc, so example scripts are
      byte-compiled.
    - Make $(PYVERS) have the default Python version at the end, so that
      the last pygtk build is with the default Python version and
      pygtk-demo has the default Python in the hashbang. Also this avoids
      python-gtk2-doc depending on a non-default Python version.
      Closes: #500118.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Add Copyright holders.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Pass -s -noreset to xvfb-run as otherwise Xvfb will reset when the first
    client (test) disconnects and xvfb-run will fail killing Xvfb.

pygtk (2.8.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Marco Cabizza ]
  * New upstream version
  * Added the watch file
  * debian/control, debian/control.in:
    - Standards-Version is 3.7.2
  * debian/compat:
    - Debhelper compatibility is 5

  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * Revert changes from the NMU (closes: #374804, #374811).
  * Require debhelper 5.0.37.2 and python-support 0.3.4.
  * Make package binNMU-able by having python-gtk2-dev depend on
    python-gtk2 >= ${Source-Version}.
  * pycompat: python standards = 2.
  * pyversions: we need python >= 2.3.
  * Make the package comply with the new policy:
    + Remove python2.3-* and python2.4-* packages.
    + Correct package descriptions accordingly.
  * Replace the multiple alternatives in the postinst by a single
    alternative pointing to /usr/share/python-support/python-gtk.
  * python-glade2.examples: move examples one directory up.
  * rules: rework and simplify.
  * Remove move_files and use *.install files instead.
    + Don't install the .la files, which are useless anyway.
  * rules: don't use config.status as the configure target because of
    the stupid way make treats intermediary files.
  * Require some minimum versions for python-cairo and python-numeric.
  * python-gtk2.postinst: cleanup pygtk.py[co] from the former package,
    as they were not handled.
