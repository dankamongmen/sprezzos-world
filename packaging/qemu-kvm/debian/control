Description: Full virtualization on x86 hardware
 Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual PCs, each running unmodified Linux or
 Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a
 network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc. 
 .
 KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
 Linux hosts on x86 hardware with x86 guests. KVM is intended for systems where
 the processor has hardware support for virtualization, see below for details.
 All combinations of 32-bit and 64-bit host and guest systems are supported,
 except 64-bit guests on 32-bit hosts.
 .
 KVM requires your system to support hardware virtualization, provided by AMD's
 SVM capability or Intel's VT. See /usr/share/doc/qemu-kvm/README.Debian for
 more information.
