  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * Update xrandr epoch.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * debian/libgtk-3-0.postrm.in: Drop "rm -rf /etc/gtk-3.0/" on purge since
    this removes files owned by libgtk-3-common. Those bits were copied over
    from the gtk+2.0 package but they are actually obsolete and no longer
    required. Closes: #681198
  * debian/patches/073_transparent_colors.patch: Handle transparent colors
    better in GtkStyle emulation. Patch cherry-picked from upstream Git.
    Closes: #669694
  * debian/patches/070_revert-widget-set-up-signals-after-initializing.patch:
    This patch was a temporary workaround for a bug in mutter which has been
    fixed in version 3.4. It was not supposed to be shipped as part of wheezy,
    so drop it again.
  * If the NEWS or README file is larger than 4k in size append a .gz suffix
    as dh_compress will compress those files. This avoids dangling symlinks.

  * Add 000git_gtk_tree_view_get_tooltip_context_annotation.patch: Fix
    gtk_tree_view_get_tooltip_context() transfer annotation, causing crashes
    when using this method from Python.
  * Add 016_no_offscreen_widgets_grabbing.patch: Widgets inside
    GtkOffscreenWindow seem like they should not be allowed to do
    grab the mouse or whatever, as this can deactivate open menus.
    (LP: #512427, GNOME #607668)
  * Add 017_no_offscreen_device_grabbing.patch: Do not allow devices in an
    offscreen hierarchy to take grabs. (LP: #804009, GNOME #658563)
  * Add 018_gdkenumtypes.c_location.patch: Always generate gdk/gdkenumtypes.c
    in the source tree, and fix path in the introspection sources. With this,
    gdkenumtypes.c is correctly included with separate build trees, too.  This
    fixes missing GTypes in the .gir when using a separate build tree.
    (LP: #769256, GNOME #647729)
  * debian/rules: Bump SHVER to 3.1.90.
  * Build for multiarch. Adapted Steve Langasek's changes to Ubuntu's gtk+2.0
    package:
    - debian/control.in: Bump build dependencies to multiarch aware versions.
    - debian/control.in: Add Multi-Arch: and necessary Pre-Depends: fields.
      (libraries/-dbg are "same", -doc/-bin are "foreign").
    - debian/rules: Use multiarch LIBDIR.
    - debian/libgail-3-dev.install, debian/libgail-3-0.install: Rename to
      *.in, and use @LIBDIR@ instead of hardcoded usr/lib.
    - debian/gir1.2-gtk-3.0.install.in: Use @LIBDIR@.
    - debian/libgtk-3-0.triggers.in, debian/libgtk-3-0.postinst.in,
      debian/rules: Also trigger on changes to the fallback non-multiarch
      module directory, which is now called @OLD_MODULES_BASE_PATH@.
    - Add 061_multiarch_module_fallback.patch: Fall back to the hard-coded
      pre-multiarch module directory when searching for modules. This
      maintains compatibility with packages installing modules to
      the old directories.

  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * Break murrine-themes (same reason as gnome-themes-standard).
  * Move /etc/gtk-3.0 to libgtk-3-common.
  * Add appropriate Breaks/Replaces to handle it.
  * Remove gtk-query-immodules-3.0 from libgtk-3-bin since it is 
    clearly not Multi-Arch compatible. It should not be needed anyway, 
    everything is handled by triggers from the private directory.
  * Remove incorrect M-A: same statement for the debug package.
  * Make libgtk-3-bin arch-any, thanks Rico for noticing.

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Switch udeb from DirectFB to Xlib to prepare the move to an X11-based
    graphical installer. Closes: #573872.
     - Replace libgtk-directfb-2.0-0-udeb with libgtk-x11-udeb in control
       file.
     - Update description accordingly.
     - Update .install.in accordingly, using the “shared_udeb” flavour,
       based on the “shared” one, but with a few X11 extensions disabled.
     - Update package name and file paths accordingly in rules file.
  * Version/Bump some B-D to make sure the udeb gets proper dependencies
    on the recently reworked/added udebs:
     - libx11-dev
     - libxcursor-dev
     - libxext-dev
     - libxi-dev
     - libxinerama-dev
     - libxrender-dev
  * Add one patch to make it possible to disable X11 extensions, and
    refresh the other one accordingly:
     - 005_support_disabling_x11_extensions.patch
     - 070_mandatory-relibtoolize.patch
  * Ship a minimal MIME database in the udeb, since the loaders mechanism
    isn’t sufficient to get proper PNG support:
     - Add shared-mime-info to Build-Depends to ensure that the
       update-mime-database tool is available at build-time, as well as
       the source freedesktop.org.xml file.
     - Add debian/keep-png-only.xsl to only keep the mime-type matching
       type="image/png". Matching with namespaces is tricky, see the
       comments in the XSL file for the details.
     - Build a MIME cache, and only ship the resulting mime.cache file
       under /usr/share/mime in the udeb.
     - While this is dirty, that should do the trick until it is needed
       for shared-mime-info to ship its own udeb.

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * Rename the udeb to libgtk2.0-0-udeb.

  * Port optimised flavor work by Loic Minier from pango1.0:
    - Rework flavor-specific vars.
      + Introduce $(flavor) which is set to $* to clarify implicit rules
      + Rename common_configure_flags to configure_flags
      + Introduce the flavor_get macro to use a flavor specific override or
        fallback to the common defaults for make vars.
      + Use $(call flavor_get, ) to retrieve configure_flags, CFLAGS, and
        LDFLAGS allowing to override these per flavor.
    - Add support for an optimised pass, implemented as a flavor
      + Define a default OPTLIBDIR and replace it in the sed foo for %.in
        files; this is like LIBDIR, but with some hwcaps extension, e.g.
        usr/lib/vfp.
      + Add vars to build an optimised vfp flavour for armel with
        additional CFLAGS
      + Add the "opt" special flavor to flavors to run the testuites on,
        CHECK_FLAVORS
      + Also sed and append %.opt after %.in when generating $ files from
        %.in; the %.opt file is optional and only included if the opt flavor
        is included.
      + Add a debian/libgtk2.0-0.install.opt which lists files from the

  * Flip back gdkpixbuf_module_files_d_str after gdkpixbuf_module_file_str in
    patch 021_loader-files-d; this fixes config of gdk loaders and hence the
    current ia32-libs implementation; the change in 2.12.0-3 was incorrect in
    that it flipped the order for im modules and pixbuf loaders, but only im
    modules had to be flipped; the reason im modules had to be flipped is that
    the first list of modules wins for im modules as there is some duplicate
    checking, while in the case of gdk pixbufs, the last file wins.  What
    remains to be done here is:
    - biarch support, similar to pango, by loading /usr/lib32 and /usr/lib64
      stuff before /usr/lib; allows dropping the config file hack in
      ia32-libs.
    - loading of modules from multiarch locations (not multiarch); allows
      dropping the config file hack in ia32-libs.

  * Fix broken second dh_strip invocation which was not only acting on the

  * Update patch 021_loader-files-d to use PIXBUF_FILES_LIBDIR which is
    defined in gdk-pixbuf/Makefile.am, similarly to PIXBUF_LIBDIR, and based
    on the newly defined loaderfilesdir, similar to loaderdir; update
    070_mandatory-relibtoolize.
  * New patch, 022_module-files-append-compat-module-files-d, prefer
    /usr/lib32/gtk-2.0/<gtk-binary-version>/loader-files.d and
    /immodule-files.d over the /usr/lib/.../*.d pathnames added in
    020_immodules-files-d and 021_loader-files-d when available; this is
    useful for ia32-libs support; other modules might need additional support
    depending on how they are loaded, for example GTK_MODULES will probably
    still be looked up below libdir, as well as engines, printbackends,

gtk+2.0 (2.12.5-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add ${shlibs:Depends} to libgtk2.0-dev.
  * Rework /usr/share/doc symlinks completely; closes: #461440.
    - Use a real directory for all packages using a symlink previously:
      libgtk2.0-bin, libgtk-directfb-2.0-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, libgtk2.0-0-dbg,
      libgtk-directfb-2.0-0, libgtk2.0-0; add a preinst snippet removing the
      path on upgrade if it's a symlink and points to the proper directory;
      add a prerm snippet removing the path on upgrade (for downgrades) if
      it's a directory (and not a symlink).
    - Create symlinks for changelog.gz, NEWS.gz, NEWS.pre-1-0.gz, and
      README.gz in the /usr/share/doc dirs of these packages as well as for
      gtk2-engines-pixbuf; add a libgtk2.0-common unversionned dependency for
      all these packages.
    - Split dh_installdocs and dh_installchangelogs calls on multiple packages
      and use one call per package as the intent was to install in all the
      specified packages; also call dh_installdocs and dh_installchangelogs
      without any extra file for all packages to install copyright and Debian
      changelog.
    - Factor the list of dh_installdocs files in DH_INSTALLDOCS_FILES in
      rules.

  * Bump libwmf conflicts to << 0.2.8.4-5.
  * Fix control generation.
  * Include the new uploaders.mk from gnome-pkg-tools instead of duplicating
    its logic; build-dep on gnome-pkg-tools >= 0.11.
  * Run "make check" test suite for all flavors except if DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
    contains the "nocheck" keyword; ignore failures.
  * Add support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS_PARALLEL.
  * Re-enable FAQ and Tutorial which were fixed upstream at some point; update
    installation dirs.
  * Call dh_installman -a.

  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * 040_filechooser_single-click.patch: remove shortcut-related actions
    in the response callback. This fixes the annoying bug where you need
    to click twice on "save" after clicking on a shortcut.

    use .32 and .64 suffixes in all cases (compatible with Ubuntu), b) fix
    typo, c) use g_file_test() instead of g_access(); does not cover module
    loading via env vars; closes: #406453.
  * Upload to unstable; drop check-dist include.
  * Wrap build-deps and deps.
  * Add Conflicts on gcin (<= 1.3.4-1), gtk-qt-engine (<= 1:0.8~svn-rev31-3),

    vars and share the common flags.
  * Only pass --host to configure if DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE and DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE
    differ.
  * Stop shipping *.la and *.a files of modules (all module types).
  * Move GTK_BINARY_VERSION back to rules.
  * Use GTK_BINVER_DEP instead of BINVER.
  * Build flavors out-of-tree; saves 25% of required build space (315 MB) and
    some build time / IO load; this clutters the headers a little (full build
    path is mentionned instead of ".") though.
  * Rewrite and cleanup the build process completely.
  * Install the full set of pkg-config files from the dfb flavor in
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libgtk-directfb-2.0; to use this feature, set
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH while invoking pkg-config (or configure); the
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig/*directfb*.pc files will be removed when Debian sources
    have been converted.
  * In the same spirit, gdkconfig.h is in /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/include/directfb;

    suggesting them.
  * Rewrite update-gdkpixbuf-loaders and update-gtk-immodules.
  * Drop double libatk1.0-dev build-dep.
  * Empty the dependency_libs in the *.la files of libgtk2.0-dev.
  * New immodule files handling with *.immodules files below
    /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/immodule-files.d.
    - New patch, 020_immodules-files-d, to split the module search path on
      ":", as is done in Pango, prepend
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/immodule-files.d to the search path,
      and to read all *.immodules files when a directory is encountered in the
      search path.
    - Pre-generate
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/immodule-files.d/libgtk2.0-0.immodules
      for the shared library.
    - Continue generating /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules until packages are
      updated.
  * Add the libpixmap engine to the udeb for the new Bladr GTK theme for g-i.
  * New loader files handling with *.loaders files below

    - New patch, 021_loader-files-d, to split the module search path on
      ":", as is done in Pango, prepend
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/loader-files.d to the search path,
      and to read all *.loaders files when a directory is encountered in the

    - Pre-generate
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/loader-files.d/libgtk2.0-0.loaders
      for the shared library and libgtk-directfb-2.0-0-udeb.loaders for the
      udeb.
    - Continue generating /etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders until packages are
      updated.
    - This particular patch uses two ugly workarounds and needs work before
      being sent upstream.
  * New Debhelper-based command, dh_gtkmodules, to create module files for IM
    modules and GdkPixbuf loaders; it will still add a dependency on the
    binary version of Gtk for other modules.
  * Make use of the new dh_gtkmodules during the build (override the path to
    gtk-query-immodules-2.0 and gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to gtk2-engines-pixbuf.

    - Make large GtkSizeGroups more efficient.
    - Improve positioning of menus in GtkToolbar.
    - Make scrolling work on unrealized icon views.
    - Avoid unnecessary redraws on range widgets.
    - Make sure that all GTK+ applications reload icon themes promptly.
    - Ensure that gdk_pango_get_context() and gtk_widget_get_pango_context()
      use the same font options and dpi value.
    - Multiple memory leak fixes.
  * debian/control.in:
    - updated the libgtk2.0-dev Depends according to the changes.
  * debian/rules:
    Add --enable-explicit-deps=yes to make sure stuff like x11 gets listed as a
    Requires: in gdk(-x11)-2.0.pc, because otherwise linkage against -lX11 and
    friends doesn't get carried through.  Whether or not this is correct is
    arguable, since libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0* ends up linked against it anyway, but
    stuff like gnome-panel seems to be relying on this transience.
