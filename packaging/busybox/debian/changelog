busybox (1:1.20.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * set CONFIG_FEATURE_COPYBUF_KB from 4 to 64 for all flavours.  This
    increases speed of various applets *dramatically*.  For example, wget
    applet downlad time for certain file decreased from 3.8sec to 0.6sec.
  * modprobe-read-modules-builtin.patch: stop modprobe from complaining
    when asked to load a "module" which is built-in.  Thank you
    Ben Hutchings for the patch. (Closes: #652672)
  * udeb: enable ping6 applet and FEATURE_FANCY_PING - more featureful
    ping(6) variant with statistics et al.  This makes ping6 available in
    d-i (initial network debugging), and makes ping there not only more
    useful but also using a more tested code, as used in other variants.
    4Kb file size increase on i386.
  * stop-checking-ancient-kernel-version.patch: a rather trivial patch
    to disable compatibility code for kernels <2.2.18 in nfs mount.
    This was the only place in debian busybox which used
    get_linux_version_code() function which was buggy on kernels with
    less than 3 components version number.  So instead of fixing that
    function, we got rid of the last user of it.  (Closes: #684611)

busybox (1:1.20.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * reorder patches in debian/patches/series: all upstream first,
    debian-specific next.  cmp(1) shows no changes in the resulting
    sources (after applying patches both ways)
  * dont-force-no-alignment-for-s390.patch: do not use ALIGN* macros
    on s390 and s390x because gcc generates wrong code (for wrong
    declarations).  No effect for anything but s390(x), where the
    resulting package does not work anyway. (Closes: 681760)

busybox (1:1.20.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * enable various xargs features for all flavours, to make it work
    as POSIX requires (notable quotes and backslash processing).
    Also enable -0 option, apparently forgotten at the time (it
    complements find -print0 which is enabled).  (Closes: #680342)
  * replace my ps-get-uptime.patch with busybox-1.20.1-ps.patch
    (it is the same patch, just file formatting changed and it
    is now obvios the patch is applied upstream)
  * added another upstream bugfix patch, busybox-1.20.1-mke2fs.patch,
    to fix mkfs.ext2 breakage.  It is only used in static flavour in
    debian, but producing broken filesystem isn't an option there too.
  * busybox-1.20.1-1.20.2.patch -- change version to 1.20.2.  This is
    the only remaining change to upstream 1.20.2 stable release.
  * enable ping applet for udeb build, +613 bytes on i386.  (Closes: #406114)
  * update shell-ash-export-HOME.patch - DEP-3 headers and a long
    description.  This patch now removes "const" modifier from the
    default PATH variable definition, making it writable.  Full
    description is within the patch comments. (Closes: #679377)

busybox (1:1.20.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * 1.20 had a few fixes which I forgot to mention:
    - integer overflow in expression on big endian (Closes: #635370)
      (I dislike the fix since it makes use of 64bit integers
      instead of using unsigned 32bit, but this is how upstream
      fixed it)
    - CVE-2011-2716 udhcpc insufficient checking of DHCP options (Closes: #635548)
      busybox dhcpd now replaces values of HOST_NAME, DOMAIN_NAME,
      NIS_DOMAIN, TFTP_SERVER_NAME with the literal string "bad"
      if these contains any bad characters.
  * applied stable patches from upstream (ash, man, ifupdown, tar)

busybox (1:1.20.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * new upstream (mostly bugfix) release
  * got rid of the long-standing debian-specific applets-fallback.patch, once
    upstream added commit 83f103b30e41ab038e "ash: in standalone mode, search
    in $PATH if /proc/self/exe doesn't exist".  I still carry the patch itself,
    but it isn't referenced in the series file anymore.
  * removed patches which were applied upstream, and added a few patches
    from upstream 1.20 stable branch
  * refreshed swaponoff-FreeBSD-support.patch and u-mount-FreeBSD-support.patch
  * refreshed configs for 1.20
  * enabled many httpd options (AUTH_MD5, RANGES, SETUID, CGI, GZIP, ENCODE)
    for static and regular build, which results in ~5Kb binary size difference
    on x86 but enables features users are asking
    (Closes: #548999, #626820, #571743)
  * enabled dpkg-buildflags usage (filtering out -Werror=format-security from
    CFLAGS) (Closes: #670993)
  * ship some docs and examples in static and regular builds (Closes: #671832)
  * enable expand/unexpand and ar-long-options in deb build, - small changes
    to reduce difference from static config.
  * added reenable-ps-options-for-DESKTOP-case.patch
  * DEP-3 headers for init-console.patch

  * releasing to experimental due to applets-fallback.patch removal

  * enabled a few options for top and ps applets in deb, taken from static
  * enabled NFS mount (Note: only NFSv2 and v3, not v4, and only on Linux)

  * enabled microcom for deb build, taken from static
  * relaxed the "links" subpackages version dependencies from source:Version
    to source:Upstream-Version
  * DISabled some questionable applets from static build,
    to match regular build:
   - acpid

   - adduser, deluser, addgroup, delgroup

    options for regular&static builds (it has already
    been enabled for static)
  * enable init and halt/poweroff/shutdown applets for
    all variants and make them consistent.  Also remove
    mesg applet from static build
  * enable vconfig applet for regular build, making it
    consistent with static & udeb
  * enable hwclock applet for regular & udeb builds, and
    disable FHS adjtime for static build (to make the
    location consistent with util-linux)
  * enable login&getty applets in regular build (the same as for static)
    (Closes: #523034)
  * kFreeBSD does not define MNT_NODEV anymore, work around it
    (Closes: #667530)
  * apply fix-test-!-segfault.patch from upstream git.  (Closes: #660573)
  * bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3 (no changes necessary)
  * simplify debian/rules a bit
  * mark udhcpc and udhcpd packages as Architecture: linux-any instead of all,
    since they're really linux-specific for now, which in debian terms means
    not arch-independent so "all" can't be used.  This means that we'll have
    uchcpc_i386.deb, udhcpc_mipsel.deb etc so it wastes space in archives,
    but this should give better _user_ experience.

busybox (1:1.19.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * enabled module-init-tools (for 2.6+ kernels, with depmod and modinfo)
    in all 3 - regular, static and udeb - builds.  Size change on i386:

      text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    525121    1779    8984  535884   82d4c busybox(deb)

    534137    1779    8984  544900   85084 busybox(deb)+mit+modinfo+depmod
    294309    1514    8688  304511   4a57f busybox(udeb)
    298131    1514    8688  308333   4b46d busybox(udeb)+mit
    299290    1514    8688  309492   4b8f4 busybox(udeb)+mit+modinfo
    301397    1518    8688  311603   4c133 busybox(udeb)+mit+modinfo+depmod

    which is about 7Kb (9Kb with depmod) difference for regular deb and
    5Kb (7Kb with depmod) for udeb.  This is a long-awaited change.

  * kfreebsd: use xterm terminal type instead of cons25. Thanks to
    Robert Millan <rmh@debian.org> for the patch. Closes: #647672.

  [ Michael Tokarev ]
  * added /etc/insserv.conf.d/busybox-syslogd to tell insserv we're
    providing syslog service.  Closes: #647942
  * stop canonicalizing "source" argument of mount on FreeBSD, to
    allow "nodev" filesystems to be mounted.  Closes: #637082
  * forcibly enable swapon/swapoff on kfreebsd even if these a marked
    as linux-specific.  Closes: #647287.
  * revert static-math-overflow-on-big-endian (Reopens: #635370)
  * move udhcpc default.script from /usr/share/udhcpc back to /etc/udhcpc
    where it was long time ago.  It may conflict with the same conffile
    as was in udhcpc package back in lenny, but the scripts from that

  * another iteration around PLATFORM_LINUX change.
    Do not remove PLATFORM_LINUX in arch-specific configs,
    since it does not hide linux-specific options anyway.
    This should finally fix FTBFS on kfreebsd, and it
    makes config files exactly the same as they appear
    on linux platform.
  * add another patch (sent upstream) to mark modinfo
    selecting CONFIG_LINUX as all other linux-specific
    options.  Another FTBFS on kfreebsd and hurd
  * add a patch (and sent upstream) to use CBAUD definition
    conditionally in (rewritten in 0.19) getty.c - hurd does
    not have this #define.  FTBFS on hurd.
  * updated to upstream 1.19.3 (minor bugfix) release,
    removing all patches taken from upstream
  * static-math-overflow-on-big-endian.patch (sent upstream),
    to fix integer overflow in header on big-endian platform

busybox (0.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First attempt at packaging BusyBox as a .deb.  This has been in 
    in the Debian boot-floppies CVS tree forever.  Hopefully, having it as a
    standalone app will make life easier for me, the debian-installer team, and
    everyone else as well...
  * I have created a busybox-static that can be used as a rescue shell when you 
    hose your system.  Just invoke "busybox sh" to fir up the shell.  This has
    every app provided by busybox staically linked in.  There have been several
    times in the past that I would have loved to have this sitting on my system
    (i.e. when libc gets screwed up.)
