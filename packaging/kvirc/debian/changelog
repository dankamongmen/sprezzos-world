    - Standards-Version is now 3.8.3:

    because the primary is down atm). (Issue found by lintian.)
  * debian/patches: Added short explanations to the patches (thanks lintian).
  * debian/kvirc-data.links: Raúl noticed, that 
    <file:///usr/share/kvirc/4.0/license/COPYING> didn't end up in the kvirc
    package and the intended link to <file:///usr/share/doc/kvirc/copyright>
    wasn't set. Added an entry to address that.

      directory instead (which the comments also suggest).
    - Make a local hack in src/kvirc/kernel/kvi_app_fs.cpp to look for

  * Change CXXFLAGS to fix autobuilds. The march=cpu_type flag had been getting
    the wrong cpu_type.

kvirc (2:2.1.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump Standards-Version.
  * Various debhelper changes.

kvirc (2:2.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another attempt at getting it through the autobuilders - disabled pthread
    check.
  * Better check for libqt-mt.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Mar 2003 15:07:56 -0100

kvirc (2:2.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug where not having kvirc-doc installed would make it impossible
    to find the global kvirc directory. (Closes: #180987)
  * Fixed check for Qt after the reorganization of the libqt* packages broke
    it.
  * Add libqt3-compat-headers to the list of build-depends.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Feb 2003 13:03:05 -0100

kvirc (2:2.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since it seems the autobuilders cannot find kvirc_2.1.2.1.orig.tar.gz,
    try uploading a new .orig.tar.gz.
  * Fix sections for kvirc-doc and kvirc-dev.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Feb 2003 11:12:37 -0100

kvirc (1:2.1.2.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.5.8.
  * Remove workaround for g++ problem on SPARC in the hopes that the latest
    gcc-3.2 no longer suffers from the problem.
  *	Use dh_install (simplifies debian/rules nicely).
  * Minor changes to auto* scripts to deal with newer Qt.
  * Compile against Qt3. (Closes: #173881, #177818)

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Feb 2003 00:56:30 -0100

kvirc (1:2.1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Due to bug #162712 in liblcms1, kvirc did not build on HPPA. This problem
    should be resolved with the newer version of liblcms1. (Closes: #162929)
  * I had already noticed the autobuilders did not work. This was due to
    configure not existing in the original .orig.tar.gz file. It was created
    by patch from the .diff.gz file and as a result, did not have executable
    permission. This was fixed in the previous release - which did not make it
    into the archives due to the above problem. (Closes: #162447)

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Sep 2002 21:24:17 +0000

kvirc (1:2.1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release to make the autobuilders happy again.
  * KVIrc now builds and runs with KDE 3.0.3. Not yet fully tested,
    but KDE 3 will not be in unstable for a while anyway.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Sep 2002 11:00:15 +0000

kvirc (1:2.1.2-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt in a pristine, chroot'ed build environment. (Closes: #157289)
  * Provide .orig.tar.gz and .diff.gz files. (Closes: #161595)

kvirc (1:2.1.2-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turn on KDE support for autobuilt KVIrc packages.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Aug 2002 18:30:31 +0000

kvirc (1:2.1.2-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * The autobuilders failed on -13 because the .po files had
    duplicate messages; turns out I had an older msgfmt which was less
    strict about that. Grrr...
    (Somehow, I *knew* version -13 would be bad news)

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Aug 2002 02:24:03 +0000

kvirc (1:2.1.2-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added automake1.6 to the build dependencies. (Closes: #155918)
  * Fixed build problems on IA64.
  * Tightened build dependency on debhelper to >= 4.1.1 since I am
    using its -L flag.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Aug 2002 13:31:31 +0000

kvirc (1:2.1.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "121212" release :)
  * Upstream usability fixes; see upstream changelog for details.
  * Upstream stability fixes:
    - Closes: #149254 - crash when executing /part in private chat.
    - Closes: #150383 - crash when using /topic in a channel.
    - Closes: #139431 - problem was with spaces in username.
  * Run dh_shlibdeps properly to avoid generating a self-dependency.
  * When -debug is specified in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, optimizations
    are turned off for better debugging results.
  * Added the KVIrc homepage to the description.
  * Changed the Suggests on kvirc-doc to a Recommends.
  * Suggest xmms.
  * I removed some plugins that were not so useful.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Aug 2002 16:32:56 +0000

kvirc (1:2.1.2-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * #138169: The problem in bug #138169 is due to a bug in libtool. See
    bug #98342 for details. KVIrc still does not build correctly even with
    the latest libtool (1.4.2-4). When this gets properly fixed I will update
    kvirc's build dependency on libtool. In the mean time, I have applied a
    patch from that bug report which fixes it for me.
    (Closes: #138169)
  * Redid debian/rules somewhat; no longer try to build differently
    depending on how KDE is installed. If the preferred configuration breaks
    for some platform, I'd rather know about it.
  * Do not link versus qt-mt anymore.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Apr 2002 10:21:07 -0400

kvirc (1:2.1.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change default alternative nick to "newbie_".
    Set auto-rejoin-on-kick to off by default.
    (Closes: #138633)
  * Add devscripts to Build-Depends because dch is used by the autoconf
    update routine.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Apr 2002 07:54:37 -0400

kvirc (1:2.1.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove "-pre" from the version as it tends to clutter up users' home
    directories. Users should remove any redundant ~/.kvirc-2.1.2-preX
    directories themselves if they are not using them anymore. The window
    caption is stored inside ~/.kvirc-2.1.2/config/kvi.irc.conf and
    can be configured from within KVIrc. (Closes: #133471)
  * Fix the autoconf bit to make it compile with the autoconf EXEEXT
    bug. Basically this involves making sure that autoconf 2.5x is used
    instead of autoconf 2.13. Strange that this did not bite me before.
  * Various upstream bug fixes.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Feb 2002 19:23:43 +0000

kvirc (1:2.1.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Oct 2001 20:59:17 -0700

kvirc (1:2.1.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support pulling in the latest config.{sub,guess} add compile-time.
  * Build-Depends: autotools-dev.
  * Build with -fno-exceptions again.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Oct 2001 11:42:08 -0600

kvirc (1:2.1.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use updated config.sub and config.guess so we properly build on all
    architectures. (Closes: #115144)

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Oct 2001 10:27:01 -0600

kvirc (1:2.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the build dependency on automake by moving the autogen.sh
    outside of the debian/rules and shipping the configure and Makefile.in
    files in the source package. In the long term kvirc will have to be able
    to use automake 1.5 but in the mean time I will keep the old automake
    around on my machine. (Closes: #114714)
  * Modified the descriptions a bit to make them more, well...  descriptive.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Oct 2001 17:41:36 -0600

kvirc (1:2.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Small fix in the handling of options to configure.
  * Include .xpm files in source package to avoid the segfault in convert.
  * Removed the build-dependency on imagemagick.
  * Fixed ldconfig handling in postinst and postrm scripts.
  * Cleaned up rules files.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Oct 2001 14:26:35 -0600

kvirc (1:2.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the version number to 2.1.2 to match upstream version.
  * Hopefully with dependencies installed on arm and powerpc the package
    will build for those platforms now...
  * Fixed a harmless warning during doc generation.
  * Disable objprelink for Debian build since it confuses lintian
    (shlib-with-non-pic code).
  * Previous upload fixed the segfault bug. (Closes: #111625)

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Sep 2001 12:59:10 -0600

kvirc (2.1.2-pre8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the segfault on exit bug.
  * Change build dependency on libqt-dev.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Sep 2001 18:26:29 -0600

kvirc (2.1.2-pre7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add ldconfig to postinst script for kvirc.
  * Fix -rpath issues. For good this time, I hope.
  * Change build dependency on imagemagick (>= 5.2.8) since older
    versions of imagemagick would segfault on big-endian systems.
    Hopefully this makes the autobuilders happy again.
    See #107294 for details.

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Sep 2001 15:41:09 -0600

  * Upstream: documentation updates.
  * Upstream: usability enhancements.
  * Enable -O3 optimisation for x86 platforms.
  * Generate 64x64 icons.
  * Sanitized debian/rules.
  * Add hints to the menu file.
  * Integrate objprelink with libtool to make for faster startup.
  * Have KVIrc report the proper version.
  * kvirc-doc should be Architecture: all.
  * KVIrc is now lintian-clean.
  * Font anti-aliasing was turned on in 2.1.2-pre3. (Closes: #108490)

 -- Robin Verduijn <robin@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Aug 2001 11:54:52 -0600

kvirc (2.1.2-pre5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Yet more upstream enhancements... Triskelios never sleeps, it seems.
  * Enabled multithread support.
  * Do not patch Makefile; patch acinclude.m4.in instead.
  * Add Depends: kvirc to kvirc-dev and kvirc-doc.
  * Make the configure target change the literal $PREFIX in the man page
    to the prefix we're installing in, i.e. /usr.
  * Add a versioned dependancy on libqt2 (>= 2.3) and kdelibs3 (>= 2.2)
    since I think only specifying libqt2 was creating problems for
    people on older systems.
  * Supply rfc2810.txt, rfc2811.txt, rfc2812.txt and rfc2813.txt with
    kvirc-doc, since the documentation mentions their existence.
  * Supply Plugins-devel-HOWTO with kvirc-dev.
  * Supply the example plugin with kvirc-dev, to help people figure out
    how to write their own plugins.
  * Have a working basicplugin example that compiles properly.
  * Allow for compilation of plugins using the kvirc-config script. This
    used not to work unless one had the full source package installed.
  * KVIrc is compliant with standards version 3.5.6 now.
  * It should now be easier for (beginning) developers to sit down and
    write plugins for KVIrc :)

  * Compiled with Standards-Version 3.5.5
  * Use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to build a debug-enabled version, if desired.
