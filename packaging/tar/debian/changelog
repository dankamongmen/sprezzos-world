tar (1.13.22-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * new upstream version, released specifically to help close bugs in woody
    upstream (Paul Eggert) says:
      regarding 1.13.22
        This fixes Debian bug 92106, in addition to the bug fixes I already
        reported to you for GNU tar 1.13.20 and 1.13.21.  It also fixes a
        core-dump bug for tar 1.13.19 and later, reported to bug-tar.
      regarding 1.13.21
        This fixes Debian bug 95984, in addition to the bug fixes I already
        reported to you for 1.13.20.  It also upgrades tar to use gettext
        0.10.39.
      regarding 1.13.20
        I haven't had time to fix all or even most of the bugs, but I suggest
        closing out or modifying the following bug reports:
        13312 I changed tar to avoid the problem (I hope; I can't test it).
        52092 Fixed.
        58890 Fixed, I think -- at least, I can't reproduce it now.
        65719 Not a bug? last message in that bug report says it works for him.
        77664 Not a bug.  In that context FOO:BAR means 'file BAR on host FOO'.
        78179 Sorry, I don't follow this report.  Tar does strip leading '/'s 
        	for me.
        83458 Fixed.
        83735 Fixed.
        85400 Fixed for the info page only.  The man page is not part of 
        	tar-1.13.20.
        90794 This partly seems to be a Debian packaging problem; see 94257.
        94287 Fixed.
        95344 Fixed.
