  * Provide machine parseable output which may be used by file-rc to calculate
    dynamic sequence number for each script. (Closes: #573004)
  * Use "overrides" instead of "overwrites" and define defaults as "LSB
    defaults" when emitting warnings. (Closes: #668559)

insserv (1.14.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMUs, thanks Christian & Luk.
  * Use source format 3.0 (quilt), drop build dependency on quilt.
    Remove debian/README.source.
  * Use dh at compat level 8, significantly reduce debian/rules and
    build depend on debhelper >= 8.
  * Use dh_bash-completion dh sequence utility to install completion
    snippet, rename snippet to debian/insserv.bash-completion and build
    depend on bash-completion.
  * Use dpkg-buildflags to set default CFLAGS & LDFLAGS and get noopt
    handling for free. 130_crossbuild_fixes.patch allows upstream
    Makefile defaults for COPTS, LDFLAGS & CC to be overridden by the
    environment variables exported by debian/rules. Also decouple `make
    check' from `make install' to ease cross building. Set & export CC
    environment variable in debian/rules to (hopefully) allow cross
    building. (Closes: #629540, #629539, #666212)
  * Patch upstream Makefile to execute Debian testsuite instead of
    common suite.
  * Update to Standards-Version 3.9.3, no changes in policy warranted
    changes in packaging.
  * Refresh patch series.
  * Suggest the actively maintained bootchart2 instead of the doormant
    bootchart package. (Closes: #599012)
  * Update insserv package description. (Closes: #549327)
  * Undocument the CONCURRENCY feature and add a reference to a modern
    discussion about the status of init systems in Debian. (Closes: #605368)
  * Add test_invalid_core_string to test conditions described in
    #611292.
  * Correctly quote here statements in test_undetected_loop with non-
    interpolating quotation marks. Make test unconditionally fatal now
    that test is not incorrectly interpolating $local_fs in script headers.
  * Add 150_core_string_test.patch from Ben Harris <bjh21@cam.ac.uk> to
    fix inconsistent filtering of core dumps. (Closes: #611292)
  * Fix manual page reference to init(8). (Closes: #634150)
  * Purge update-rc.d-insserv & update-bootsystem-insserv as per
    Petter's advice in changelog entry for version 1.12.0-11. sysv-rc >>
    2.87dsf-2 takes care of all that stuff now.
  * No longer provide LSB dependency overrides for obsolete (etch or
    before) packages such as hotplug, modutils, initrd-tools and devfsd.
    (Closes: #545164, #545165, #545166, #545169)
  * Mention when insserv should (not) be used and how update-rc.d is
    almost always the interface you want to use. (Closes: #566352)
  * Use the package short summary in the manual page too, it mentions
    the keyword "dependency". (Closes: #609655)
  * Update debian/watch file for savannah.gnu.org sysvinit project site.

  * Use dh_lintian during build.  Depend on debhelper (>= 6.0.7) for this.
  * Correct wiki URL in README.Debian (Closes: #545171).  Thanks to
    Josh Triplett for noticing the old URL.
  * Make sure check-initd-order generated valid dotty files when
    scripts provide strings with " in them (Closes: #545521).  Thanks
    to Laurent Bonnaud for discovering the problem.
  * Drop the Loading... messages from the default verbosity level, and

insserv (1.12.0-11) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Migrate the responsibility for enabling or disabling dependency
    based boot sequencing from the insserv package to the sysv-rc
    package.  Rewrite package description to reflect this (Closes:
    #475478, #511753, #538959).  Keep a dummy update-bootsystem-insserv
    script to avoid having to conflict with sysv-rc version 2.87dsf-2.
    Keep update-rc.d-insserv to make it impossible for the update-rc.d
    diversion to be a dangling link during upgrades.  Make it a copy
    of update-rc.d from the new sysv-rc version to make sure both
    behave the same way.  update-rc.d-insserv should be removed in
    Squeeze+1.  update-bootsystem-insserv could be removed when
    sysv-rc 2.87dsf-2 has been gone from unstable for 3 months.
  * Drop dependencies on sysv-rc, initscripts and sysvinit-utils, and
    leave it for sysv-rc to pull in the packages needed for dependency
    based boot sequencing to work properly.
  * Update README to reflect that dependency based boot sequencing is
    now the default in Debian.  Drop reference to obsolete CONCURRENCY
    setting (Closes: #540447).
  * Add new test case test_override_remove trying to reproduce bug #540866.
    No luck so far.
  * Add new test case test_insserv_virt_loop to reproduce a bug
    reported by Raphael Geissert, where an incorrect insserv.conf will
    make insserv hang forever.  Add new patch 94_v1_12_2.patch from
    upstream to fix it (Closes: #541613).
  * Correct test test_early_all to fail if $all do not work with stop
    sequences.  Add new patch 95_stop_all.patch from upstream to fix
    it (Closes: #542043).
  * Change the definition of $syslog to include rsyslog, sysklogd,
    dsyslog, inetutils-syslogd  and syslog-ng, to include all syslog
    implmenetations in the archive.  Dropped the syslog provide from
    the list, as it should not be used.
  * Update to Standards-Version 3.8.3, no changes required.
  * Add lintian override for the transitient update-bootsystem-insserv
    binary missing a manual page.
  * Add new test test_local_virtual to verify that local virtual
    facilities work properly.

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Add new patch 20_install_perms_fixup.patch to install binary and
    conffile with correct permissions.
  * Add new patch 21_tests_suite_new_functions.patch to add a couple
    of new test suite functions to upstream test suite.
  * Make sure update-rc.d compares command line parameters for start/stop
    runlevel configuration with the Default-Start and Default-Stop values in
    LSB info comment of script and warns if there are differences.

  * Change check-initd-order to return a exit code when there is a problem
    with the boot sequence or dependencies.
  * Change the default to enable dependency based boot sequencing if
    it is safe to do.  This should enable it in the common case,
    while avoiding conversion on problems.
  * Move all code from insserv.config to insserv.postist and remove

  * Add required trailing slash to Vcs-Browser URL.
  * Improve package description to make it more obvious that insserv

  * Depend on sysvinit-utils (>= 2.86.ds1-62) to get a version of
    startpar that keep working even when /dev/pts is not yet mounted.
  * Depend on the initscripts version we want (>= 2.86.ds1-63)
    (instead of conflicting with the version we do not want which can
    give upgrade problems), to get one with the X-Interactive flags
    set in the scripts.  Drop hostname, mountkernfs, mountdevsubfs,

    #510517, #534711).
  * Fix typo in testsuite function initdir_purge(), making sure the
    rc?.d directories are removed during purge.
  * Add new patch introducing a new keyword 'X-Interactive: true' in
    the LSB header (Closes: #458224).  Add test suite to verify that
    it is working.
  * Add DM-Upload-Allowed: yes header to allow my co-maintainer to
    upload this package.
  * Add testcase for incomplete .depend.boot file based on test

  * Add debian/patches/90_no_runlevel_spec_for_debian.patch to remove
    reference to known runlevels on Debian systems. These should be
    defined in Debian policy. (Closes: #500542)
  * Add interface to disable|enable service symlinks for all Default-
    Start runlevels or those specified on the command line. This is
    analogous to the interface introduced to update-rc.d of 2.86.ds1-62.
  * Make sure disable|enable action does not call insserv if it did not
    alter any runlevel symlinks.
  * Consolidate debian/insserv.dirs into debian/dirs, only one should
    exist.
  * Add debian/bash-completion and install it to /etc/bash_completion.d/
    to enhance usability for bash shell users.
  * When arguments to start/stop/defaults action are given to update-
    rc.d wrapper, emit a warning that the LSB information of script
    overrides the given arguments.
  * Improve the way in which update-rc.d disable/enable function
    determines index of S or K bit of runlevel symlink by using rindex
    instead of a hardcoded index.
  * Improve update-rc.d enable/disable function for when an unhandled

  * Also look in /usr/share/insserv/overrides/ when performing
    disable/enable function in update-rc.d.

  * Make test_incorrect_stopscripts() a fatal test, insserv should not
    add shutdown links when none are present.
  * Make test_newbug_keepoldorder() test case non-fatal, the fact that it
    passed before was not by design but by luck, as per upstream analysis

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * New test case to demonstrate the bug reported in #477415.
  * Include empty directories /etc/insserv.conf.d and
    /etc/insserv/overrides in the package, to get dpkg to warn about
    content there when purging insserv (Closes: #471237).
  * Debconf translations:
    - Updated German from Erik Schanze (Closes: #479254).

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Add patch 60_disable_cfgfilter_stat to remove stat check from the
    callback function that filters the scanning of /etc/insserv.conf.d/ dir
    for confiuration file snippets. Instead do stat check in scan_conf().
  * New test case to show that two initscripts cannot have the same Provides
    field.
  * New test case exposing ability to insert a script into runlevel
    configuration that depends on virtual facility that is not provided or
    does not exist.
  * New test case to check that /etc/insserv.conf.d/ can be used to allow one
    or more services to define and provide a virtual facility.
  * Ensure custom insserv.conf.d/* files are cleaned after
    test_insserv_conf_d() in run-testsuite.
  * Add test_onlystart() test case to check we can insert scripts with empty
    stop runlevel configuration.
  * Add test_broken_header() test case to show it seems possible to insert a
    script missing Required-{Start,Stop} lsb info fields.
  * Add test_no_default_start() to show that it seems possible to insert script
    missing Default-Start field.
  * Add test_no_default_stop() to show that it seems possible to insert script
    missing Default-Stop field, and that links are created in stop runlevels.
  * Add 62_warn_on_missing_required_fields and
    63_warn_on_missing_default_fields to enable warnings by default about
    missing Provides, Required-Start, Required-Stop, Default-Start or
    Default-Stop  LSB comment keywords.
  * Add a note to new patches to relate them to a case function of the test
    suite.
  * Add 64_missing_default_fields_fallback to ensure sane fallback of
    empty runlevel configuration is used for scripts missing Default-
    Start or Default-Stop lsb keywords.
  * Add test_noprovides_header() to show that it is possible to insert script
    missing Provides keyword, and many warnings are exposed as a result.
  * Add test_adding_start() to expose that adding start levels uncleanly
    modifies on disk configuration. Give test_adding_start and
    test_adding_stop test script unique names.

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Made test_adding_start and test_adding_stop checks non-fatal for
    production builds, as this problem is no regression from earlier versions.

    does not to work properly, and gave false error reports.
  * Removed flag file /etc/update-rc.d-insserv and use the update-rc.d

    and implement check of the shutdown sequence.
  * Extended to check reverse dependencies too.
