cron (3.0pl1-124) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Release targeted to Wheezy including fixes for critical/important bugs ]
  * debian/{preinst,postinst,postrm}: remove obsolete /etc/cron.daily/standard
    on upgrade. (Closes: #679062)
  * debian/cron.init: Have the init.d file remove cron's pidfile if it 
    exists after killing the process. The pidfile should be removed
    by cron itself (but it isn't) through its SIGhandler as done in later
    versions in cron (4.1 and cronie). This fix is, however, simpler and less
    intrusive. (Closes: 679106, 615855)
  * debian/control:  
       - Reword last paragraph since cron does not provide any standard tasks
         anymore. (Closes: 674192)
       - Update to Standards-Version: 3.9.3 - which BTW includes an indication
         on which are the valid cron filenames.
       - Depend on debhelper >= 9 (lintian warning)

cron (3.0pl1-123) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/standard.daily: Apply patch from Steve Allison to prevent checking
     two times the same filesystem. This prevents bogus warnings about missing
     lost+found in schroot bind mounts (Closes: #660879)
  * debian/rules: Apply patch from Steve Langasek to add cross compiler
    support to cron (Closes: #666892)
  * debian/cron.default, debian/standard.daily, debian/rules: Remove
    the lost+found check as this is no longer required and causes
    issues with some filesystems (e.g. bind mounts, locally mounted USB
    drives). Additionally, in some filesystems the directory
    will be generated when required. (Closes: #620164, #658743, #662605,

  * debian/source/lintian-overrides:
    - Removed, no longer required
  * crontab.5:
    - Escape the '%' in the examples so that they can work when copied over to

cron (3.0pl1-120) unstable; urgency=low

  * do_command.c, cron.h, cron.8: 
    - Change the behaviour when logging the information of the child processes.
      A new loglevel (8) is introduced and documented in cron.8. The previous
      log format is kept unless the sysadmin choses to select this new option.
      (Closes: #637295) 
  * debian/examples/cron-stats.pl:
    - Adjust the script with the changes introduced in the logging behaviour.
  * cron.8: Fix minor formatting errors
  * debian/cron.bug-script:
    - Report properly on the EDITOR variable. Thanks to Jan Braun for the
      report.
    - Also report the contents of /etc/cron.* dirs. This is helpful when
      debugging syntax/mode/naming errors. Users that do not want to share this
      information should edit/delete before reporting bugs.
  * debian/changelog: Typo fixes and missing information
  * debian/control:
    - Update package description, removing the "backup of key system files" as
      a feature. The last of these responsibilities were transffered in -117.
  * crontab.5: 
    - Document limitations of the periods that can be defined in crontab syntax
      and provide workarounds (Closes: #640086)
    - Document limitation of the use of @reboot due to the definition of the
      boot sequence as suggested by Regid Ichira.
  * debian/source/lintian-overrides:
    - Add overrides file for lintian required because the maintainer name in
      debian/changelog and in debian/control do not match due to encoding.
  [ Christian Kastner ]
  * debian/control:
    - Fix broken Vcs-* URLs
  * debian/NEWS: 
    - Remove spurious NEWS entry (the entry for -110 was duplicated at the
      bottom)

  * The development team has migrated from Subversion to git, with the latter
    becoming authoritative immediately. A log of the migration process can be
    found in debian/svn-git-migration.txt.

  [ Javier Fernandez-Sanguino ]
  * debian/NEWS:
    - Remove the entry introduced in the previous version until an agreement is
      reached on the desired behaviour (Reopens: #608774)
  * debian/standard.daily: 
    - Work properly if mount points have a space (Closes: #633972)
    - Sanity check mount point value before generating an error
  * Add one new example script:
     - cron-tasks-review.sh: Reviews the files that exist in /etc/cron.d
       and in /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} to find those that
       will not be run by cron due to some error.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Adjust debian/copyright to acknowledge the (c) and license of the new
      example script.
  * debian/control:
     - Remove Steve from the Uploaders field, no longer needed there
  * cron.8: 
     - Document the Debian specific changes in a separate section, describing
     how /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} and /etc/cron.d behave
     and should be used.

  [ Christian Kastner ]
  * debian/control:
    - Updated Vcs-* URLs to point to the new git repository
  * debian/cron.c, database.c:
    - Interpret the "-L" option of the daemon as a bitmask, and add initial
      support for three selectors: start, stop, end
  * database.c, cron.c, cron.h, debian/copyright:
    - Check orphaned crontabs for adoption. Fix taken from Fedora cronie.
      Closes: #634926
  * do_command.c:
    - When logging a job run, prefix the command text with the PID of the
      process. Closes: #609780
  * debian/NEWS:
    - Added entry documenting the change of the "-L" option as well as the
      dropping of LSBNAMES in -117.

cron (3.0pl1-118) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control
    - Limited Build-Depends for libaudit-dev to linux-any. I erroneously
      assumed it applied to other OSes as well.
  * debian/rules
    - DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS for audit support is limited to Linux platforms

  [ Javier Fernandez-Sanguino]
  * debian/NEWS
    - Document the new behaviour of cron regarding logging of non-zero
      exit status cronjobs (Closes: #608874)

 -- Christian Kastner <debian@kvr.at>  Tue, 31 May 2011 14:50:34 +0200

cron (3.0pl1-117) unstable; urgency=low

  * Makefile:
    - Fixed integration of cron-internal debug code into the package building
      process. Instead of having to modify debian/rules, this can now driven by
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=debug
    - Removed hard-coded compiler flags, honoring those provided by
      dpkg-buildflags instead
  * do_command.c:
    - When logging the end of cron jobs, log the PID of the actually exec'ed
      user command, not the PID of the parent. Closes: #609780
  * database.c:
    - Split crontab security checks (type, owner, mode, links) into separate
      tests with individual error messages instead of the cryptic message
      "WRONG INODE INFO". Closes: #625493
    - Extended the ability to recover from broken symlinks (added in -110) to
      also recover from failed security checks above. Fixes to these were not
      being detected as cron only looks at mtime. Closes: #625495
    - Also recover from syntax errors. Fixes to these did change mtime, but
      were ignored as cron permanently removes broken crontabs from its
      database of files to check. Closes: #627859
  * cron.8:
    - Documented the fact that /etc/crontab and files in /etc/cron.d must not
      be group- or other-writable. Closes: #625491, LP: #741979
  * crontab.5:
    - Specify parse order of crontabs (thanks, Jonathan Amery). Closes: #622645
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.2 (no changes needed)
    - Added missing Build-Depends on libaudit-dev
    - Removed Conflicts for nonexistent package suidmanager
    - Removed Conflicts for lockfile-progs (which should have been a Breaks
      anyway) as we no longer rely on it, we use flock from util-linux instead
    - Changed architecture-specific Build-Depends on libselinux1-dev to
      linux-any instead of negating all other OSes
  * debian/cron.default:
    - Merged the LSBNAMES option with EXTRA_OPTS. Both where used to pass
      options to the daemon, making one of them redundant
    - Added the ability to disable the daily lost+found check by setting the
      new variable CHECK_LOSTFOUND to "no". Closes: #579640
  * debian/cron.init:
    - Don't call start-stop-daemon directly, use LSB init functions instead.
      Among other things, this works around the cron daemon not deleting its
      pidfile from /var/run/. Closes: #615855, 622348
    - Added $network to Should-Start
  * debian/rules:
    - Converted to dh syntax. This included replacing some manually executed
      steps with debhelper file-automated ones (eg: cron.man, cron.examples)
      to lessen clutter
    - Completely rewrote the PAM/SELinux/audit integration parts. PAM support
      was being skipped on kfreebsd and hurd, and audit support was completely
      broken. From now on:
      + PAM is enabled by default on all platforms
      + SELinux is enabled by default on linux-any
      + audit is disabled by default on all platforms
      All of these can be driven by DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS (see debian/rules)
    - Do not compress example perl scripts
  * debian/{prerm,postrm,postinst}:
    - Let dh_installinit manage stopping/(re)starting of jobs instead of
      calling invoke-rc.d ourselves
  * debian/standard.daily:
    - Backup of /etc/{passd,group} is no longer performed by cron; the task
      was handed over to src:shadow (see #554170). In Squeeze, this task will
      be performed redundantly by both packages (as discussed on
      debian-release) (Closes: 333837)
    - Rewrite locking and lost+found-checking code, based on a submission to
      the BTS by Justin B. Rye. Closes: #478967, #537073, LP: #257367
    - Parse /etc/mtab instead of /proc/mounts; the former makes handling bind
      mounts easier. Closes: #578856
    - Pull in /etc/cron/default for CHECK_LOSTFOUND (see above)
  * debian/copyright:
    - Convert to DEP5 format (r173)
  * debian/watch:
    - Added watch file to silence a lintian warning, even though the last
      upstream release was in 2004
  * Packaging (general): removed a lot of cruft which seems to have accumulated
    over time. This included all the cron-se stuff, which appears to have been
    a remnant from the SELinux integration process, and was either not being
    used anymore or completely broken. Also, the patches/ directory was
    removed, as that location has a specific meaning and the patches in there
    were no longer relevant.

cron (3.0pl1-116) unstable; urgency=high

  * Upload with approval from Release Team to get RC bug fixes in Squeeze
    (see http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2010/12/msg00719.html)
  * do_command.c, popen.c:
    - Use fork() instead of vfork().
  * do_command.c:
    - Close an unused stream in the fork()ed child prior to exec'ing the
      user's command, thereby avoiding an fd leak. Closes: #604181, LP: #665912
      Previous to this, and in conjunction with LVM, the fd leak may have the
      effect of the user being spammed by warnings every time a cron job was
      executed.
  * crontab.5:
    - Fixed the example demonstrating how to run a job on a certain weekday of
      the month (date range was off-by-one). Also, the same example contained
      a superfluous escape, resulting in wrong output. Closes: #606325
  * cron.init:
    - Added $named to Should-Start, in case @reboot jobs need DNS resolution.
      Closes: #602903
    - Added nslcd to Should-Start. LP: #27520

cron (3.0pl1-115) unstable; urgency=high

  * cron.c: set LC_COLLATE to 'C' in order to properly work when locales
    are set that change the collation order expected by the regular
    expressions used in load_database(). By setting locale we were
    skipping some crontabs unexpectedly due to [a-z] not matching all the ascii
    characters in some languages (such as Estonian).  (Closes: #600310)
    Thanks to Michael Tokarev for spotting this issue and for
    Bastian Blank for pointing for the fix.
  * debian/cron.init: 
      - Fix typo that prevented it from properly loading LC_CTYPE (Closes:
        #600082)
      - Force LC_COLLATE to 'C' regardless of user locale settings.

cron (3.0pl1-114) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleanup of the package in preparation of the next Debian release.
     - Notice that only one change introduces new behaviour (debian/cron.pam),
       the other changes are just documentation fixes or cleanups to the
       packaging.
  * debian/cron.pam:
    - In addition to the reading /etc/security/pam_env.conf and 
      /etc/environment (obsolete config file) previous default,
      cron will now also read /etc/default/locale in order to setup
      the proper localisation environment for tasks.
  [ Documentation fixes ]
  * debian/cron.{default,init}, cron.8, crontab.5:
    - Updated documentation (comments in scripts and manpages) regarding the
      reading and setting of locale information for the cron daemon and for
      cron tasks to document the new behaviour due to the above change.
  * debian/{preinst,postinst,postrm}:
    - Since /etc/cron.monthly/standard does not provide any worthwhile task
      anymore, remove obsolete /etc/cron.monthly/standard after upgrading
      (local changes are preserved, however). Closes: #585680
  * crontab.1
    - Minor typo fixes to the manpage.
  * crontab.5:
    - Added an example submitted by jidanni (thanks!), showing how to run a
      command on the second Saturday of the month. Closes: #584514 
    - Minor fixes
  [ Fixes to the packaging ]
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.1 (no changes needed)
    - Added Pre-Depends for dpkg (>= 1.15.7.2) for a dpkg-maintscript-helper
      with support for safely removing conffiles
    - Added Homepage: field
    - Added Vcs-* fields
    - Upgraded debhelper dependency version for dh_bugscripts
  * debian/rules:
    - Replace deprecated dh_clean -k with dh_prep
  * debian/NEWS:
    - Apply Steve Langasek's patch to remove non-newsworthy content, avoiding
      unnecessary output from apt-listchanges during upgrade. Closes: #591005
  * debian/source/format:
    - Make source format explicit (1.0)

  [ Christian Kastner ]
  * do_command.c:
    - Don't send mail when a job exits non-zero, only send mail if the job sent
      output to stderr. This behaviour was introduced erroneously; while it
      does have merit, it is completely against standard cron behaviour.
      Closes: #581612
  * debian/compat:
    - Bumped debhelper compatibility to 7
  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.4 (no change needed)
    - Build-Depend on debhelper (>= 7.0.50~)
    - Added dependency on ${misc:Depends} to package cron
  * debian/cron.init:
    - Changed Default-Stop from (1) to (empty). rc0 and rc6 were removed in
      3.0pl1-101 because the stop action -- sending SIGTERM/SIGKILL to cron
      on shutdown/reboot -- was redundant. This, however, also applies to
      rc1, because killprocs will do that for us.
  * debian/postinst:
    - Removed obsolete dpkg file backup code, this has been handed over to dpkg
      in 3.0pl1-109
    - Removed last remaining stop action (for rc1) from upate-rc.d (see above)
    - Add dpkg-statoverride for /usr/bin/crontab, and unconditionally change
      permissions of /var/spool/cron/crontabs. Closes: #304036, #460095
  * debian/standard.monthly:
    - Removed because it had been empty for years and therefore served no
      purpose
  * debian/cron.bug-{control,script}
    - Added to extend information submitted by reportbug
  * debian/rules:
    - Applied changes for standard.monthly and cron.bug-{control,script} above
  * debian/copyright:
    - Updated to reflect recent contributions
  * debian/README:
    - Updated ancient information with the current status (PAM support, SELinux
      support, etc.)
  * debian/TODO:
    - Added new entry regarding clarification of the purpose behind /etc/cron.d
  * debian/REFS:

       Justin Pryzby, based on an analysis by Alexis Huxley (thanks!). Debian's
       default MTA, exim, does not time out, so it shouldn't have been
       affected.  Closes: #155109, #443615
     - Bypass mail generation/sending code when no MTA is installed.
       Previously, jobs with a lot of output would die once the pipe's buffer
       was filled.  Closes: #577133

       reflecting Debian's SGID crontab vs upstream's SUID
  * entry.c

cron (3.0pl1-107) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/cron.pam: Use common-session-noninteractive in pam.d configuration

cron (3.0pl1-106) unstable; urgency=high

   * SECURITY UPDATE: cron does not check the return code of setgid() and
   initgroups(), which under certain circumstances could cause
   applications to run with elevated group privileges. Note that the more
   serious issue of not checking the return code of setuid() was fixed already
   in 3.0pl1-64.  (Closes: #528434)
    - do_command.c: check return code of setgid() and initgroups()
    - This fixes (hopefully completely) CVE-2006-2607
   * crontab.c: 
      - close the temporary file after it is edited and
        before calling cleanup_tmp_crontab() to behave properly on NFS
        mounted / (Closes: #413962)
      - if crontab is run without argument then it will read stdin to replace
        the users crontab. This way it is POSIXLY_CORRECT. More information at
        http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html
        (Closes: #514062)
   * crontab.5 : 
      - Add details about multiple recipients in MAILTO (LP: #235464) 
        (Closes: #502650)
      - Indicate that it also reads environment from /etc/environment
      - Substitute ATT for AT&T (Closes: #405474)
   * Proper fix for PAM configuration to make cron read the system
     environment (Closes: #511684)
   * debian/cron.init:
       - Add support for 'status' in the init.d (Closes: #514721)
       - Use 'cron' instead of 'crond' (Closes: #497699)
   * Change lockfile-progs from Suggests: to Recommends: and remove wording
     related to dselect, which is no longer relevant (Closes: #452460, #468262)
   * Add justification of checksecurity being in the Suggests: line
   * Change the (outdated) wording of the description based on an example
     provided by Justin B Rye (Closes: 485452)
   * Change the postinst so that update-rc.d is only run if /etc/init.d/cron is

cron (3.0pl1-103) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix bug introduced in the init.d file with the changes in the previous

  * Modify pathnames.h so that GNU/KFreeBSD is detected and /var/run is
    used instead of /etc/ to store the PID file (Closes: #460514)
  * Modify the init.d script so that it uses /etc/cron.pid as its pidfile
    if it exists, this will prevent the init.d script from failing if
    cron is compiled in a system which does not get to define _PATH_RUN
    as /var/run

cron (3.0pl1-101) unstable; urgency=low

  * Init.d changes:
    - Add LSB dependencies on mounted /usr (Closes: #459489)
    - Remove 0 and 6 from Default-Stop LSB definition in the init script
      as sendsigs take care of stopping cron" debian/cron.init. Also
      change the postinst call to update-rc.d so no stop symlinks
      are added in those runlevels (Closes: #422785)
      [ Notice that the existing symlinks are not removed when upgrading
        it is up to the administrator to remove this himself so as to not
        break local changes ]
    - Parse system's locale to set the charset used to email cron tasks. This
      will affect tasks that expect a 'C' locale (for example to parse
      messages) and are running in systems with a non-C locale. 
      (Closes: #410057, #405335, #309150)
    - Add support for /etc/default/cron and make it possible to add additional
      options and control if environment is parsed. (Closes: #396928, #471506)
  * cron.c:
    - Do not use ANSI_x3.4-1968 but US-ASCII instead since it is the preferred
      MIME name as per http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets"
      (Closes: #415302)
  * crontab.c:
    - Add an option to ask for confirmation when a crontab is to be removed,
      based on Fedora's patch for this same request. Users wanting this 
      behaviour have to alias cron (just as rm is aliased to 'rm -i')
      (Closes: #117758, #289636, #324103, #414048)
    - Print the location of CRONDIR when printing files on the crontab dir so
      that the error messages have the absolute location of the files they
      refer to. (Closes: #391350)
  * Lintian fixes:
     - Modify debian/copyright to point to the location of the Artistic
       License.

cron (3.0pl1-96) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix crontab.5 typo (changed quotes ' to ") that prevent a line from being
    presented (Closes: #379230)
  * Small typo fix in cron.8
  * Introduce Steve Grubb's patch to emit audit log message on crontab denial
    based on the patch from Fedora, and adapted to Debian's cron version. The
    main difference is that audit logs are generated if cron is compiled to
    'ALLOW_ONLY_ROOT'. This patch is currently disabled
    since LSPP's audit library is not yet available.
  * Change misc.c so that a user that is *both* in the cron.deny and
    cron.allow files will be denied access (previously he would be permitted
    access)
  * Add two example scripts:
     - stats-cron.pl: A script written by myself that can be used to audit
       the behaviour of cron and benefits from the new cron logging (-L 2)
       option to log the *end* of a cronjob.
     - crontab2english.pl: A script written by Sean M. Burke that translates
       the crontab notation to natural language.
  * Adjust debian/copyright to acknowledge the (c) and license of the above
    scripts.

cron (3.0pl1-95) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle errors when reading crontabs so that it stops reading entries in 
    a crontab file after a syntax error. This prevents a rogue user from
    dumping binary files in /etc/cron.d/ or /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ 
    and have them executed by cron (but binary files under
    /etc/cron.{daily,weekly,monthly} will still be processed as they are
    handled by run-parts). Thanks to Faidon Liambotis for the patch.
    (Closes: #378153)
  * Reuse vixie-cron-4.1-_51-bz180145-mail_i18n.patch from Fedora Core in
    order to setup a proper Content-Type when sending e-mails. The
    Content-Type will be set to the default system locale or cron's
    environment (if it modifies it). If the locale is undefined it will
    default to US ASCII (Closes: #338051)
    - There is no need to define a CHARSET variable now with the above
    patch (Closes: #309150)
  * Support kfreebsd-amd64 by modifying the Build-Depends for SElinux 
    (Closes: #361458)
  * Fix typos in the crontab.1 manpage spotted by Jonas Koelker 
    (Closes: #369153)
  * Add option to control logging (-L) with patch provided by Steve Fosdick.
    This makes it possible to log cron job finishing if you use -L 2
    (Closes: #271747, #318247)
  * Change Steve's email in crontab.c error message to
    cron@packages.debian.org

    it will print an error message but not exit, which I think is okay. If
    you have a username with a newline in it, then you deserve to lose,
