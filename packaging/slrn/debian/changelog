slrn (1.0.0~pre10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package is based on the svn snapshot from
    https://slrn.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/slrn/trunk

  * slrnpull: Cleaned up the permissions underneath /var/spool/slrnpull
    and added an override file for lintian. Now, only the directories
    /v/s/s/out.going and /v/s/s/out.going/rejects have unusual
    permissions. The override file required to request a debhelper
    version >= 6.0.7~.

  * slrnpull: Ship /var/spool/slrnpull/requests with the package and set
    appropriate permissions that every user can request the body of
    articles.

  * slrnpull: Removed the link /var/spool/slrnpull/slrnpull.conf and rely
    on fallback to /etc/news/slrnpull.conf.

  * Raised the Standards-Version to 3.8.1. No changes needed.

 -- Jörg Sommer <joerg@alea.gnuu.de>  Sun, 19 Apr 2009 22:34:50 +0200

slrn (1.0.0~pre2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package is based on the svn snapshot from
    https://slrn.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/slrn/trunk

  * Added the configure option --without-x to disable the check for X
    libraries and header files, because the build of slrn should be the
    same with and without the X libs installed (dirty build environment).

  * Enabled additional compiler warnings to uncover sources common
    mistakes at build time. -Wformat=2 -Wunused -Wundef -Wextra
    -Wswitch-enum -Wpointer-arith -Wnested-externs -Wbad-function-cast
    -Wcast-qual -Wcast-align -Wshadow

  * Really link with libuu. Use --with-uu instead of --with-uudeview. The
    options was renamed with 0.9.9.1. (closes: #506645)

  * Do not link slrnpull with libuu, because it doesn't use it.

  * Remove the workaround from 0.9.9~pre102-3 to read /etc/news/server.
    Slrn's configure supports the option --with-server-file, now.

  * Increased Standards-Version to 3.8.0. Added the file README.source to
    describe how to use dpatch (or better said link to the defaul
    description in /usr/share/doc/dpatch).

 -- Jörg Sommer <joerg@alea.gnuu.de>  Sun, 23 Nov 2008 22:36:07 +0100

slrn (0.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    + A solution to workaround the problem of overlong lines in the
      header, especially the References line, was added in version
      pre127. (closes: #472006)

  * Remove the patch gnutls-support.dpatch, because it's applied to the
    upstream source in pre123.

  * Adapted the watch to the the new location on space.mit.edu, former
    sourceforge.net.

  * Added the DM-Upload-Allowed field in the control file.

    NNTPSERVER_FILE. (closes: #469586)

  * Reset the value of the configuration directory with a make option to
    overwrite the default value of $(sysconfdir)/slrn. This solves also
    the problem that slrnpull search slrnpull.conf in /etc/news/slrn.

slrn (0.9.9~pre102-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replaced selfmade hardening support by the package hardening-wrapper.
    This handles all those special cases I don't have done in my selfmade
    version. The hardening-wrapper doesn't use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, but its
    own variables DEB_BUILD_HARDENING*; see man hardening-wrapper. So,
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nohardening isn't used. (closes: #478057)

  * Updates of debconf translation:
    + Vietnamese, thanks and a big sorry to Clytie Siddall. I've
      completely missed this bug report. (closes: #461378)

slrn (0.9.9~pre102-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package is based on the svn snapshot from
    https://slrn.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/slrn/trunk

  * Removed the dpatch add-missing-checks, because is was applied
    upstream.

  * Updates of debconf translations:
    + Danish, thanks to M. P. Rommedahl (closes: #475563)
    + Basque, thanks to Piarres Beobide (closes: #475965)

  * Enabled hardening as suggested in
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/01/msg00006.html
    As long as DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS doesn't contain "nohardening" the CFLAGS
    -fPIC -fPIE -fstack-protector -Wformat=2 -Wextra -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
    and the LDFLAGS -Wl,-zrelro,-pie are used.

  * Removed the hostname-in-binary check from debian/rules and added a
    dpatch to remove the unused domainname and hostname checks from
    configure. Upstream told in [1] the hostname-in-binary problem #83725
    can't happen with the current code. (closes: #472361)

    [1] http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=slrnfvftt7.1v2.joerg%40alea.gnuu.de&forum_name=slrn-user

  * Fixed permission of /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/slrn and …/slrnpull. The scripts
    missed the executable flag.

  * The scripts in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d do no longer run the subjob as a
    background process, because this breaks the quick calling mode of
    pon.

  * Install the scripts from /etc/ppp/ip-up.d in /etc/network/if-up.d,
    too, and modified them to not run, if the variable MODE contains
    loopback, i.e. don't start, if the loopback device comes up.

  * Dropped the dpatch 209_optic, because it breaks the translation of
    these strings and I don't see what's the intent of this patch.

  * Dropped the dpatch 206_branding, because I don't see what's the value
    of this patch except for fun.

slrn (0.9.9~pre99-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * This package is based on the svn snapshot from
    https://slrn.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/slrn/trunk

  * The slrn package shipped the file /etc/default/slrnpull. Now, it
    shipps the file slrn. (closes: #470630) Due to this bug I've raised
    the urgency of this version to high.

  * Raised debhelper compatibility level to V5, because V4 didn't support
    comments in debhelper files.

  * Now, the "make install" call installes all files in debian/tmp and
    the files are installed with dh_install* tools into the packages.
    This way we benefit from fancy things like character encoding
    conversion to UTF-8 by dh_installman.

  * Merged in the Debian changelog entries of version 0.9.8.1pl1-22 to
    -28 (the package uploaded to unstable). The changes from these
    versions aren't needed, because they are mostly overridden by changes
    done since 0.9.9~pre77-1.

  * Updates of debconf translations:
    + Galician, thanks to Jacobo Tarrio (closes: #414042)
    + Portuguese, thanks to Américo Monteiro (closes: #433397)
    + Russian, thanks to Yuri Kozlov (closes: #471028)
    + French, thanks to Steve Petruzzello (closes: #472598)
    + Finnish, thanks to Esko Arajärvi (closes: #473017)
    + German, thanks to Erik Schanze (closes: #473319)

  * Do not update the config settings in the postinst scripts, if the
    admin removed the config file in /etc/default. (closes: #471864)

  * Added a note about the missing support for /etc/news/server to
    NEWS.Debian. This does not fix #469586, but it should make people
    aware of this problem.

  * Added dpatch add-missing-checks to check for functions, header files
    and types used in the source. This adds IPv6 support, because now the
    necessary functions are detected. (closes: #473214)

slrn (0.9.9~pre97-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package is based on the svn snapshot from
    https://slrn.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/slrn/trunk

    + 97. src/slrn.c: If SLang_getkey fails, then exit. (closes: #450845)

  * Removed debian/patches/fix-s-lang-spelling.dpatch and
    debian/patches/fix-manpage-hyphen.dpatch; they are applied upstream

  * Added symlink from /u/s/slrn/newsgroups.dsc to /v/l/slrn/newsgroups.dsc,
    because slrn searches there for the newsgroups.dsc file. It's not
    possible to configure a different path for this file.

  * Removed code from postinst and preinst scripts for upgrades from
    version prior to 0.9.8.1 (current version in stable). Upgrades from
    these versions aren't supported.

  * /etc/default/slrn and …/slrnpull are a real conffile, now.

  * Removed automake from the Build-Depends field. It's not used.

slrn (0.9.9~pre77-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * This package is based on the svn snapshot from
    https://slrn.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/slrn/trunk

  * Set Jörg Sommer as new maintainer

  * Removed unneded patches: 100_version.diff 200_unneeded-deps.diff
    207_damn-autoconf.diff

  * Removed rebuild of locale files and removed gettext from
    Build-Depends filed

  * Renamed all slrn related files in debian/ to slrn.$file.

  * Added support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt and nostrip

  * Moved ${misc:Depends} to the Pre-Depends field, because debconf is
    used in the preinst script.

  * Added debian/patches/fix-manpage-hyphen.dpatch to use minus signs
    instead of hyphens in the manpages.

  * Added debian/patched/fix-manpage-s-lang-spelling.dpatch to unify the
    spelling of S‐Lang in the manpage of slrn.

  * Increased Standards-Version to 3.7.3.0. Moved slrn to the menu
    Applications/Network/Communication.

  * Removed version informations in Build-Depends field. All packages in
    stable are newer as the requested versions. Removed dpkg-dev from
    Build-Depends field and debianutils from Depends field. Both are
    essential and need no special request.

  * Removed Conflicts/Replaces fields from slrnpull for a nine years old
    version.

  * Added Homepage, Vsc-Browser and Vcs-Git fields.

  * Reworked deconf questions:
    + Updated shared/news/server to follow dev-ref.

    + Merged slrnpull/run_manual into slrnpull/run_from.

    + Dropped slrn/lost_slrnpull. It's old and an abuse of debconf.

    + Merged slrn/manual_getdescs into slrn/getdescs.

    + Rephrased slrn/getdescs_now to include no questions in the long
      description.

  * Added NEWS file

  * Applied three upstream diffs: slrn-0.9.7.3-menu.diff, 
    slrn-0.9.7.3-mimeenc.diff, slrn-0.9.7.3-ssl.diff (this last is useful only
    if you build slrn with ssl support).

    of the debconf stuff.
  * Fixed it to look for newsgroups.desc in the traditional place again.
    Closes: #119896

slrn (0.9.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream, with i18n.
  * Use new upstream make install target, instead of doing it all by hand.
  * The debian diff is down to just patching 4 lines in slrnfeat.h.
  * Moved slrnpull to /usr/bin from sbin (matches man page).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Nov 2001 18:45:42 -0500

slrn (0.9.7.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Oct 2001 18:46:37 -0400

slrn (0.9.7.2-6) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * Upstream security fix; slrn's internal uudecoder auto-executes any
    shell script in the archive (thinking it's a shar, presumably!). That
    just doesn't fly in today's internet. Slrn in unstable is actually
    probably not vulnerable, probably, since it is set up to use the
    uudeview library for decoding. However, this is too critical a security
    fix to omit.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Sep 2001 11:23:35 -0400

slrn (0.9.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Some changes to configure to make everything we've always built
    continue to build with this new version.
  * slrnpull.1 man page now shipped with slrn, so use it rather than the
    stub I wrote.
  * clientlib is dealt with, so the source is pristine once more.

  * Slrn will now consult /etc/mailname to sret the posting_host (the
    hostname in the From: line of posted messages. Done by setting
    OUR_HOSTNAME=/etc/mailname in slrnfeat.h. Closes: #62265
  * Added code to prompt for a valie for /etc/mailname if it doesn't exist
    yet. Using shared debconf question shared/mailname.
  * Fixed a bug that made slrn ask about /etc/news/server on fresh slrn
    installs when the file already existed.

slrn (0.9.7.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hm, I can't generate configure from configure.in easily, since it needs
    an external mqacro file. Instead, I'll wimp out and just build-depend
    on mail-transport-agent. Closes: #100963

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Jun 2001 18:21:14 -0400

slrn (0.9.7.0a-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the slrnpull question about how to run slrnpull from low to
    high, since this is a critical question to slrnpulls operation, and
    there is not a very good default for everyone (bug #96792).

slrn (0.9.7.0a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream, with a new maintainer. Incorporates many debian patches.
    - this is the slrn.sourceforge.net version, Closes: #80200, #75961
    - manual.txt documents all the variables, Closes: #57300
    - decodes utf-8 (partial support anyhow, with more planned), Closes: #60650
    - should fix DST issues, Closes: #70050
    - group list position is preserved on 'G', Closes: #67926
    - looks like error printing is improved, Closes: #39672
  * Updated home page info.
  * Turned off grouplens support, as the project seems to be dead.
  * Added contrib/ directory contents to the examples.
  * Removed clientlib.* from the upstream tarball, and excised all code
    that tries to use it. It turns out that that file is not free software:
    restrictions on sale. Luckily, that file contains only code that is not
    used by slrn anymore (on linux anyway), so it was easy to remove.
  * Applied patches from http://slrn.sourceforge.net/patches/#sect_bugs:

  * Fixed said messed up perms on upgrade.
  * Make slrnpull.log file in postinst if it does not exist, so its perms

slrn (0.9.6.3-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had a report that the chmod/chown in the rules file fails on
    the slrnpull.conf symlink. Although I have never seen such a thing, nor
    can I reproduce it, it did make me relaize I want to make that symlink
    only after the chmod/chown, because I don't want it's perms to be
    affected.

slrn (0.9.6.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rats, I can't do away with that slrnpull.conf symlink after all, it

slrn (0.9.6.3-7) unstable; urgency=medium

   * Slrnpull now uses the scheme described in setuid.txt, Closes: #63011
     - run as user 'news'
     - and /var/spool/slrnpull/{data,news} directories are sgid group news, but not
       writable by that group, just by user news. 
     - /var/spool/slrnpull/out.going is +t to prevent users from stomping over
       other user's files.
     - Modified slrn to make posts to slrnpull spool be mode 640. (Enabled
       SLRNPULL_USE_SETGID_POSTS, and hacked it to use mode 640, not 660.)
     - Documented above in README.Debian
     - Include slrnpull/setgid.txt in binary package.
     - Added postinst code to update systems to the new permissions -- hope
       this steps on no toes.
   * Also made slrnpull read /etc/news/slrnpull.conf, so the symlink in
     /var/news/slrnpull can be done away with.

  * Don't hardcode the domain name to build host *again*. This last happened
    in 1997 and the fix for that was reverted somewhere along the way.
    To prevent it from ever happenning again, I added a regression test
    too. Closes: #83725

slrn (0.9.6.2-14) unstable; urgency=low

    redhat's BTS. It was using sizeof() incorrectly, and truncating the

    before it tries to run. Closes: #69099
  * Config scripts detect reconfigure case, and when it is reconfigured, 
    allows you to change your news server. Closes: #64299
  * The config scripts are now shell scripts, not perl programs.
  * Fixed some dumb bugs in the preinst.
  * No longer links /etc/news/server to /etc/nntpserver, the latter is
    long-deprecated.

  * Applied a patch from
    http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12750 to fix
    dozens of potential buffer overrun holes in slrn and slrnpull. These
    include local environment variable overruns which Debian should not be
    vulnerable to, since nothing in this package is installed setuid or
    setgid (unlike Red Hat). It also includes theoretical remote exploits by
    poisening newsgroup data. All theoretical, so I am not uploading it to
    frozen, but I might as well apply the patch.

slrn (0.9.6.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Whoops, my unstable version numbers got out of sync, and the changes below
    were never accepted in. Reupload with a better version number and a merge
    from the potato branch.
  * Slrnpull runs in background from ip-up.d script. Closes: #59615 
  * Closes: #54137, weird .deb timestamp problem seems to be unreproducable.
  * Closes: #53811, fixed long ago
  * Documented how to turn off colors, Closes: #43570
  * Included slrnfuns.txt, Closes: #57298
  * Changed all blue on black text to brightblue on black, in the global
    slrn.rc. This is the smallest change I can think of to make to fix the
    issue that the color scheme is unreadable in an xterm. Closes: #55201

slrn (0.9.6.2-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

    Url-escapes most stuff in URLS to prevent exploits, and doesn't use a
    fixed size buffer. Closes: #57616

slrn (0.9.6.2-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed 2 sprintf calls in launch_url that get untrusted text passed
    into them, and so could be used for exploits in theory.
  * Also fixed a quoting bug that let attackers run arbitrary commands by
    embedding them in URLs. (This is not entirely fixed, but you are safe if
    you use the suggested quoting in the slrn man page. It should really use
    exec..)
  * Luckily, there are 2 barriers for either of these security holes to be
    expolited: first, the user is presented with the url before the browser
    is launched (though an attacker could simply pad the front of the url with
    something innocuous and hope the victim didn't scroll all the way to the
    end of it). Second, you have to have non_Xbrowser or Xbrowser set in your
    .slrnrc, and they are not set by default. Still, this needs to go into
    frozen. Closes: #57616
  * The bug reporter is right, slrn needs a through audit. :-(

slrn (0.9.6.2-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Upped MAX_GROUP_NAME_LEN to 200, to deal with a nasty long group name
    floating around on pacbell's news servers. The group does not seem to be
    propigating outside pacbell, so I don't know if this is a critical bug or
    not. It will surely affect all pacbell customers who newly install slrn.
    Up to the release manager whether this goes into frozen. Closes: #57539

slrn (0.9.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The previous version removed the conffile /etc/cron.daily/slrn (it was
    moved into the slrnpull package and renamed). I notice that on upgrade 
    to slrn, this file is preserved, and gets run daily, generating error 
    messages. To work around that, I have added code to the postinst of slrn
    to delete it if it exists.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 14 May 1998 00:48:55 -0700

slrn (0.9.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Split the package into two: slrn will contain only the newsreader, while
    the new slrnpull package will contain the slrnpull stuff. Did this
    becuase it's ben pointed out some people may want slrn but not slrnpull,
    other may want slrnpull, but a news reader other than slrn.
  * Rewrote slrnconfig extensively, splitting part of it into
    slrnpullconfig, and making it all much easier to use.
  * Split /etc/slrnget.conf into 2 files, /etc/news/slrn.debian.conf and
    /etc/news/slrnpull.debian.conf

    - updated standard version.
    - fixed FSF mailing address.
    - removed du control file.
    - fixed md5sums permissions.
    - added man pages for all executables.
  * There is a problem with using slrnpull for a local news spool and
    posting outgoing news into /var/spool/slrnpull/out.going/. Unless that
    directory is set to permissions 777 (or your user is in group news), it 
    won't work. Since most people do not use slrnpull, I have not changed the
    directory permissions, but this is now documented in README.Debian. I 
    have also brought this problem to the attention of the upstream author.
