A complete list of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-c
Compile only, do not instantiate. Modelicac produces a "*.moc" file when invoked with that option.

with \-c option but is somewhat useless because of the class

Specify a path to be added to #include directives in the

 Do not remove any variable from the initial system.
