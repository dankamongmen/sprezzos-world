libwmf (0.2.8.4-10.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * libwmf-{dev,doc}.preinst: Delete /usr/share/doc/$PKG if it is a symlink
    because this is now shipped as a regular directory.  (Closes: #700353)

libwmf (0.2.8.4-10.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Add Multi-Arch headers. (Closes: #677786)
    The support was basically there. libwmf0.2-7 already ships libraries in
    /usr/lib/<triplet>. No changes besides adding headers were necessary.

libwmf (0.2.8.4-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Read libwmf binary package name from control in rules.
  * Switch to dh instead of cdbs; bump debhelper compat to 9 and debhelper
    build-dep to >= 8.9.4~; this also means multiarch, so update install files
    and rules to cope with new pathnames.  Add new 05_gdk-pixbuf-loader-dir
    patch to fix the install location for the module to be under
    gdk-pixbuf-2.0 and not gtk-2.0.  Add ${misc:Pre-Depends}.

libwmf (0.2.8.4-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ack Neil Williams's NMU; thanks!
  * Stop shipping .la files altogether; remove dependency_libs stripping code
    from rules; rdepends of libwmf-dev either dont ship any .la files or ship
    .la files which don't reference the libwmf one.
  * Add comment to debian/libwmf0.2-7.lintian-overrides to point at
    Debian #382511.
  * Update my email address in control.
  * Drop defoma support from the packaging; closes: #542336; based on patch
    from Christian Perrier; thanks!  Defoma support is also included in the
    upstream configure.{ac,in}, but is largely useless nowadays, at least the
    generated libwmf XML fontmap in /var/lib/defoma/libwmf0.2-7.d/fontmap
    doesn't list any actual font on my system.
    - Drop defoma build-dep and dep.
    - Stop shipping a var/lib/defoma/libwmf0.2-7.d directory and "rm -rf"
      it on upgrades of libwmf0.2-7.
    - Drop debian/defoma XML fontmap generation script which seems to be
      generating an empty XML fontmap nowadays; incidentally closes: #501871.
    - Stop passing --with-fontdir=/var/lib/defoma/$(libwmf_pkg).d and
      --with-gsfontdir=/var/lib/defoma/$(libwmf_pkg).d to configure; these are
      going away and didn't have any font files anyway.
    - Review fontdir, gsfontdir, sysfontmap, gsfontmap and xtrafontmap
      configure args:
      . sysfontmap is the default XML fontmap (when not specified via the API)
        and currently points at an empty XML list of fonts; this is parsed
        either by libexpat1 or libxml2; in both cases, no specific message is
        output by default if the file is missing.  The configure.ac default
        for this file is /usr/share/fonts/fontmap which has a change of
        existing with random data some day, so just set it to /non-existent.
      . xtrafontmap is similar to sysfontmap and serves asan extra fontmap on
        top of the system one.  It's also used by thelibwmf-fontmap tool which
        serves generation of fontmap XML files and isn't shipped nor used
        during build.  Keep xtrafontmap set to /etc/libwmf.fontmap to allow
        for local configuration.
      . gsfontmap is similar to sysfontmap except it points at a
        GhostScript-style Fontmap.  It seems sensible to point libwmf at
        /var/lib/ghostscript/fonts/Fontmap as generated by ghostscript's
        update-gsfontmap.
      . gsfontdir is just appended to the font search path.  Set it to
        /usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfont which is where gsfonts ships its fonts.
      . fontdir is used as the default font search location, as the default
        search location for libwmf-fontmap, as the default pathname for
        bundled fonts in the bundled XML fontmap file -- neither of which are
        currently shipped -- and as a configure default for other pathnames
        such as xtrafontmap.  Set it to /non-existent as there currently isn't
        any single directory with all supported fonts that would be useful to
        list.
  * Add debian/TODO suggesting that this package ought to generate its own
    fontmap in its own XML format, perhaps into /var/lib/libwmf/, as a trigger
    whenever /usr/share/fonts is updated.
  * Fix typo in 0.2.8.4-5 changelog entry (which closed Debian #382511 instead
    of Debian #405012).
  * Update libwmf-bin description to list names of utilities; closes: #519601.
  * Cleanup libwmf-dev deps: list ${shlibs:Depends} but drop all deps except
    for packages shipping headers referenced in libwmf's headers
    (libfreetype6-dev, x11proto-core-dev, libx11-dev, zlib1g-dev).
  * Drop obsolete Replaces/Conflicts on libwmf0-dev and libwmf0.
  * Wrap build-deps and deps to get cleaner diffs.
  * Bump up Standards-Version to 3.9.2.
  * Drop libsm-dev, libxt-dev and libice-dev build-deps; might have been used
    with AC_PATH_XTRA in the past.
  * Rename debian/install to debian/libwmf0.2-7.install.
  * Take libwmf-bin symlink upgrade snippet from Ubuntu to minimize delta;
    can be dropped in may 2012.
