.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uhd_install_firmware
[\fI-i imagedir\fR] [\fIimagetarball\fR]
.SH OPTIONS
This program works best without any arguments. If you already
have the firmware tarball and are wanting to install it on a
system without Internet access, then you can run this script
with that file as an argument.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The UHD is the universal hardware driver for Ettus Research
products. The goal of the UHD is to provide a host driver and api for
current and future Ettus Research products. Users will be able to use
the UHD driver standalone or with 3rd party applications.
.LP
Hardware supporting UHD drivers includes the Universal Software Radio
Peripheral, or USRP, available in several models.
.LP
This program installs the firmware from Ettus Research matching
this UHD driver release onto the host system. If the uhd-images
package is installed, there is no need to run this installer.
