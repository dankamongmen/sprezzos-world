.SH "NAME"
openms\-doc \- library for LC/MS data management and analysis - documentation

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the \fBopenms\-doc\fR package that
brings a full set of documentation and tutorials to the OpenMS
software framework. OpenMS offers an infrastructure for the development
of mass spectrometry-related software and powerful 2D and 3D
visualization solutions. OpenMS offers analyses for various
quantitation protocols, including label-free quantitation, SILAC,
iTRAQ, SRM, SWATH… It provides build-in algorithms for de-novo
identification and database search, as well as adapters to other
state-of-the art tools like X!Tandem, Mascot, OMSSA… OpenMS supports
the Proteomics Standard Initiative (PSI) formats for MS data and
supports easy integration of tools into workflow engines like Knime,
Galaxy, WS-Pgrade, and TOPPAS via the TOPPtools concept and a unified
parameter handling.
