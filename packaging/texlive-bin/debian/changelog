texlive-bin (2012.20120623-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * post release fixed from Peter Breitenlohner (will be included upstream):
    - (patch-dvi2tty, patch-lacheck) Ken Brown <kbrow1i@gmail.com> has noteda
    that already moderately long pathnames may yield buffer overruns in 
    lacheck and dvi2tty.
    - (patch-icu) three ICU library files have been modified (undoing ICU 
    SVN commit 36090 from 2009-06-11), in order to solve all/most XeTeX 
    problems with Indic scripts.
    - (patch-pdftex) a small change in pdftexdir/pdftosrc.cc required to
    build pdfTeX with poppler >=0.18.4 (system-xpdf).  Note, however, that 
    building pdfTeX that way slightly reduces its capability to handle large 
    files (see README.config 1.6 and 3.4.2).
  * update updmap man page (Closes: #677300)
  * (pulled from upupstream cvs, patch xdvi-upupstream-fixes)
    - Fixed bugs in property handling on 64-bit systems (related to source 
      specials).
    - Added support for XkbBell, to make the console bell work again.

    build dep, and include quilt patching in debian/rules

  * The binaries pdftex, dvips, xdvi and dvipdfmx now respect the
    system-wide paper setting as their default if there is no papersize
    information in the input file (see #49149).  It is still highly
    recommended to specify such information explicitly, e.g. using

  * The texlive-bin source package is now handled independently from the
    other TeXLive source packages, i.e. it is not configured in
    tpm2deb.cfg in our svn repository and the debian directory. Instead,
    it now looks more like a standard compiled package and should be
    easier to work on in case of security uploads or NMUs.
  * This also means that some of it's older binary packages, like
    texlive-metapost, have moved source package. By chance, this closes:
    #517600, #517601
  * Support a create-orig-source target in debian/rules.  The orig.tar.gz
    is now either wget'ed if we are working on a released version, or
    automatically created from a svn repository for development
  * There are now only three binary packages, texlive-binaries and the two
    library packages.  texlive-binaries Replaces/Conflicts/Provides
    texlive-base-bin in order to get a working (if not smooth)
    transition.

  * lots of internal changes, important ones being:
    - texlive packages now do not include files which have been
      packaged for Debian already (eg cm-super, lmodern, musixtex)
    - most packages can be used together with teTeX
    - fix several upstream bugs
    - generate license information for each file from the
      TeX Catalogue (ongoing work)
    for detailed changes see CHANGES.packaging in texlive-common
