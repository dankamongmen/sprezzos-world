Description: don't second-guess BDB ABI
 OpenLDAP upstream conservatively assumes that any change to the version
 number of libdb can result in an API-breaking change that could impact
 the database.  In Debian, we know that such changes require bumping the
 library soname and changing the package name, and demand such rigor from
 our package maintainers even when upstreams don't deliver; so any such
 check in the source code works against the packaging system by forcing
 database upgrades when we know none are required.  Disable this check
 so we rely on the packaging system to do its job.
