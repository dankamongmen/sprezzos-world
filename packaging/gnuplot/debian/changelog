gnuplot (3.7.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/rules: installation into DESTDIR is now directly supported
    by the main Makefile, this also fixes the silly "helpfile in wrong
    directory"-bug (closes: #137803)
  * Makefile.in: added libexecdir to get gnuplot_x11 into the right
    directory
  * high urgency because the help cannot be found in the last release

  * debian/control: depend on debconf (>= 0.5.00) because I need the
    seen-flag (thanks to lintian)
  * added russian debconf-template provided by Ilgiz Kalmetev
    (closes: #137656)
  * upgraded to standards version 3.5.6.0

  * included documentation with doc-base (fixes #31178)
  * gnuplot only depends on svgalib1g | svgalib1g-dummy iff binary depends on

  * several cosmetic changes in debian/rules

gnuplot (3.5beta6.340-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * gnuplot.el from the source dist added to /usr/doc/gnuplot/ as
    suggested by <Emilio.Lopes@Physik.TU-Muenchen.DE> (fixes bug #23132)

gnuplot (3.5beta6.340-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * applied a patch sent by upstream gnuplot cgm terminal maintainer
    jim van zandt <jrv@vanzandt.mv.com> to fix bad dashed lines problem
    when using gnuplot's cgm terminal (fixes bug #20183)
  * doesn't link to gnu's readline library anymore, since it probably
    violates the library copyleft (gnuplot is "free" but non-gpl); gnuplot
    uses now its internal readline facility instead

 -- tibor simko <simko@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Mar 1998 10:24:00 +0100

gnuplot (3.5beta6.340-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * after talking to upstream authors, gnuplot_x11 is moved to
    /usr/lib/gnuplot directory; its manpage is left out of the dist
    accordingly (this surely is a better solution to that missing
    manpage problem with 340-2)
  * applied a rather important patch sent from upstream gnuplot `hidden3d.c'
    maintainer hans-bernhard broeker <broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de>
  * small bugs fixed in debian/rules

 -- tibor simko <simko@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Mar 1998 15:00:00 +0100

gnuplot (3.5beta6.340-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * lasergnu script is left out of the package, since (i) it uses csh,
    (ii) it uses an insecure temporary file programming style ($$), and
    (iii) the default gnuplot policy is *not* to install it;  i've
    contacted the upstream authors concerning the second item above and
    will add lasergnu back to the dist when it is ready (fixes bug #19792)
  * don't recommend c-shell anymore because lasergnu is left out
  * two missing manpages added; i've written them myself, they are not
    "official" as far as the gnuplot program is concerned
  * `gnuplot.gih' is now in the correct /usr/share/gnuplot directory
  * all the above changes makes lintian 0.3.1 satisfied

  * sources split to .orig.tar.gz and .diff.gz while building .deb
  * lintian 0.3.0 almost satisfied: it miss 2 manpages (they are not
    really important, though)

  * specified gnuplot location in docs/latextut/Makefile.in, thanks to
    james troup <jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk> (fixes #17207)
  * a patch to correct an off-by-one error in `datafile.c' applied manually,
    since the patch is still waiting to get into upstream sources (fixes #6923)
  * a patch to compile `util.c' cleanly under alpha glibc2 applied manually,

    much better patch (not sure though)

    bug 6429

gnuplot (3.5beta6.319-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded to upstream version
  * Upstream version is actually "3.6 beta 319", but I don't think
    I can call it 3.6beta319, as that will create problems when
    the real 3.6 comes out (3.6beta319 > 3.6, so dselect will refuse
    to install 3.6 over 3.6beta319). If I could have used a better name,
    please tell me.
  * This release doesn't have the debian-specific ../demo/defaults.ini
    file, as I couldn't find a description for it in the debian files,
    and the propper defaults may have changed a bit any way
  * I allow configure/autoconf to make the configure/makefiles
    in stead of including the makefiles from the distribution.
  * Unfortunately, the csh lasergnu script changed too much for me
    to be able to reliably pach it back to usebash (I don't use the
    lasergnu script myself). So, gnuplot again recommends csh (sorry).
  * package registers menuentry.
