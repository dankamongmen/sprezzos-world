    multiarch to set our multilib paths to the correct relative directories.
  * debian/rules.defs: support turning on multiarch build by architecture;

  * debian/rules.d/binary-java.mk: jvm-exports path is /usr/lib/jvm-exports,
    not $(libdir)/jvm-exports.
  * OTOH, libgcj_bc *is* in $(libdir).
  * the spu build is not a multiarch build; look in the correct
    non-multiarch directory.
  * debian/rules2: pass --libdir also for stageX builds, needed in order to

  * debian/rules2: $(usr_lib) for a cross-build should not include the
    multiarch dir as part of the path.
  * debian/patches/gcc-multiarch+biarch.diff: restore the original intent of
    the patch, namely, that the multilib dir for the default variant is
    always equal to libdir (the multiarch dir), and we walk up the tree
    to find lib<qual> for the secondary variant.
  * debian/patches/gcc-multiarch+biarch32.diff: apply the same multilib
    directory rewriting for biarch paths with multiarch as we do without;
    still needed in the near term.
  * Put our list of patches in README.Debian.$(DEB_TARGET_ARCH) instead of

gcc-4.1 (4.1ds4-0exp4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Update to SVN 20051210, taken from the 4.1 release branch.
  * Prepare to build the java packages from it's own source (merged
    from Ubuntu).
    - Build the java packages from the gcc-4.1 source, as long as packages
      are prepared for experimental.
    - When built as gcj, run only the libjava testsuite, don't build the
      libstdc++ debug packages, don't package the gcc source.
    - Loosen package dependencies, when java packages are built from
      separate sources.
    - Fix gcj hppa build, when java packages are built from separate sources.
    - gij-4.1: Install test-summary, when doing separate builds.
    - Allow java packages be installed independent from other packages built
      from the source package.
    - Rename libgcj7-common to libgcj7-jar.
    - Introduce a gcj-4.1-base package to completely separate the two and not
      duplicate the changelog in each gcj/gij package.
  * Java related changes:
    - libjava-xml-transform: Update from classpath trunk, needed for
      eclipse (Michael Koch), applied upstream.
    - Fix java wrapper scripts to point to 4.1 (closes: #341710).
    - Reenable java on mips and mipsel.
    - Fix libgcj6 dependency. Ubuntu #19935.
    - Add libxt-dev as a java build dependency. autoconf explicitely checks
      for X11/Intrinsic.h.
  * Ada related changes:
    - Apply proposed fix for PR ada/22533, reenable ada on alpha, powerpc,
      mips, mipsel and s390.
    - Add Ada support for GNU/kFreeBSD (Aurelien Jarno). Closes: #341356.
    - Remove ada bootstrap workaround for alpha.
  * Build a separate gcc-4.1-source package (Bastian Blank). Closes: #333922.
  * Remove obsolete patch: libstdc++-automake.
  * Remove patch integrated upstream: libffi-mips.
  * Fix the installation of the hppa64 compiler in snapshot builds.
  * Rename libgfortran0* to libgfortran1* (upstream soversion change).
  * Add a dependency on libc-dev for all compilers / -dev packages except
    gcc (which can be used for kernel builds without libc-dev).
  * libffi4-dev: Fix package description.
  * On amd64, install 32bit libraries into /emul/ia32-linux/usr/lib.
    Addresses: #341147.
  * Fix installation of biarch libstdc++ headers on amd64.
  * Configure --with-tune=i686 on ix86 architectures (on Ubuntu with
    -mtune=pentium4). Remove the cpu-default-* patches.
  * debian/control.m4: Fix libxxgcc package names.
  * Update the build infrastructure to build cross compilers
    (Nikita V. Youshchenko).
  * Tighten binutils (build-)dependency. Closes: #342484.
  * Symlink more doc directories.
  * debian/control.m4: Explicitely set Architecture for biarch packages.

gcc-3.4 (3.4.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * gcc-3.4.0 final release.

  * Why experimental?
    - Do not interfer with packages currently built from gcc-3.3 sources,

    - Biarch sparc compiler doesn't built yet.
    - Use of configure flags affecting binary ABI's not yet determined.
    - Several ABI bugs have been fixed. Unfortunately, these changes will break
      binary compatibility with earlier releases on several architectures:
      alpha, mips, sparc, 
    - hppa and m68k changed sjlj based exception handling to dwarf2 based
      exception handling.

  * Build gpc-20021111 for all architectures. hppa and i386 are
    known to work. For the other architectures, send the usual FTBFS ...
    WARNING: this gpc version is an alpha version, especially debug info
    doesn't work well, so use -g0 for compiling. If you need a stable
    gpc compiler, use gpc-2.95.
  * Encode the gpc upstream version in the package name, the gpc release
    date in the version number (requested by gpc upstream).
  * Added libncurses5-dev and libgmp3-dev as build dependencies for the
    gpc tests and runtime.
  * Clean CVS files as well (closes: #169101).
  * s390-biarch.dpatch added, backported from CVS (Gerhard Tonn).
  * s390-config-ml.dpatch added, disables biarch for java,
    libffi and boehm-gc on s390. They need a 64 bit runtime
    during build which is not yet available on s390 (Gerhard Tonn).
  * Biarch support for packaging adapted (Gerhard Tonn).
    biarch variable added and with-sparc64 variable substituted in
    most places by biarch.
    dh_shlibdeps is applied only to 32 bit libraries on s390, since
    ldd for 64 bit libraries don't work on 32 bit runtime.
    Build dependency to libc6-dev-s390x added.

gcc-3.2 (1:3.2.1ds3-0pre4) unstable; urgency=high

  * gcc-3.2.1 snapshot (CVS 20021020).
    - Expansion of _Pragma within macros fixed (closes: #157416).
  * FTBFS: With the switch to bison-1.50 (and 1.75), gcc-3.2 fails to build from
    source on Debian unstable systems. This is fixed in gcc HEAD, but not on
    the current release branch.
    HELP NEEDED:
    - check what is missing from the patches in debian/patches/bison.dpatch.
      This is a backport of the bison related patches, but showing regressions
      in the gcc testsuite, so it cannot be applied.
    - build gcc using byacc (bootstrap currently fails using byacc).
    - build bison-1.35 in it's own package (the current 1.35-3 package fails
      to build form source).
    - and finally ask upstream to backport the patch to the branch. It's not
      helpful not beeing able to follow the stable branch. Maybe we should
      just switch to gcc HEAD as BSD does ...
    As a terrible workaround, build the sources from CVS first on a machine,
    with bison-1.35 installed, then package the tarball, so the bison
    generated files are not rebuilt.

  * re-add lost patch: configure with --enable-__cxa_atexit (closes: #163422),
    Therefore urgency high.
  * gcj-wrapper, gij-wrapper: Accept names starting with `.' (closes: #163172,
    #164009).
  * Point g++ manpage to correct g++ version (closes: #162843).
  * Support for i386-freebsd-gnu (closes: #163883).
  * s390-java.dpatch replaced with backport from cvs head (Gerhard Tonn).
  * Disable the testsuite run on the Hurd (closes: #159650).
  * s390-loop.dpatch added, fixes runtime problem (Gerhard Tonn).
  * debian/patches/bison.dpatch: Backport for bison-1.75 compatibility.
    Don't use it due to regressions.
  * debian/patches/backport-java-6865.dpatch: Directly applied in the
    included tarball because of bison problems.
  * Make fixincludes priority optional, so linda can depend on it.
  * Tighten binutils dependency.

    explicitly.

    all the lib packages

  * Compile with glibc 2.1 release version.
  * New upstream version egcs-1.1.2 pre3.
  * Miscellaneous rules updates (see changelog.snapshot).
  * New set of powerpc-related patches from Franz Sirl,
    <fsirl@kernel.crashing.org>.
  * Disable libgcc.dpatch (new solution implemented upstream).  Remove it.
  * Also pass $target to config.if.
  * Enable Dwarf2 EH for powerpc.  Bump the C++ binary version.  No
    loss in -backwards- compatibility as far as I can tell, so add a
    compatibility symlink, and add to shlibs file.
  * Add --no-backup-if-mismatch to the debian/patches/*.dpatch files,
    to prevent bogus .orig's in diffs.
  * Merged with (unreleased) 1.1.1.62-1 and 1.1.1.63-{1,2} packages from
    Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>.
  * Stop adding a backwards compatibility link for egcs-nof on powerpc.
    To my knowledge, nothing uses it.  Do add the libstdc++ API change
    link, though.

  * Build against glibc 2.1.
  * Make egcs the primary compiler on i386.
  * Also confilct with egcc (<< FIRST_PRIMARY)
    if FIRST_PRIMARY is defined.
    (this tells dpkg that gcc completely obsoletes egcc)
  * Remove hjl-12 patch again, HJL says it should not be
    necessary with egcs 1.1.2.
    (as per forwarded reply from Christopher Chimelis)
  * Apply libapi patch in clean target before regenerating debian/control
    and remove the patch afterward. Otherwise, the libstdc++ and libg++
    package names are generated wrong on a glibc 2.1 system.

    aren't included in the separate chunks. Please refer to the
    unmodified hjl-19990115-linux patch file in the egcs source pkg.
  * Apply warning patch to fix the annoying spew you get if you try to
    use ropes or deques with -Wall (which makes -Wall mostly useless for

    applied.

    libapi, reload, builtin-apply, and egcs patches from
    the debian/patches/ dir applied, along with the egcs-gpc-patches
    and gcc/p/diffs/gcc-egcs-2.91.55.diff.
  * Conditionalize gcj and chill (since they aren't in this
    branch).
  * Fake snapshots drop the -snap-main.

egcs (1.1b-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * [debian/control.in] Fixed typo in dependencies (#28076, #28087, #28092).

egcs (1.1b-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strengthened g++ dependency on libstdc++_LIB_SO_-dev from
    `Recommends' to `Depends'.
  * Updated README.Debian for egcs-1.1.
  * Updated TODO.

egcs-snapshot (19981005-0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Make libstdc++2.9-snap-main and libg++-snap-main provide
    their mainstream equivalents and put those equivalents into
    their shlibs file.
  * Package gcj, the GNU Compiler for Java(TM).

  * New upstream version of egcs (The -regcs_latest_snapshot branch).
  * Build without libg++ entirely.
  * Leave out gpc for now - the internals are sufficiently different
    that it does not trivially compile.
  * Include an experimental reload patch for powerpc - this is,
    in the words of its author, not release quality, but it allows
    powerpc linuxthreads to function.
  * On architectures where we are the primary compiler, let snapshots
    build with --prefix=/usr and conflict with the stable versions.
  * Package chill, a front end for the language Chill.
  * Other applied patches from debian/patches/: egcs-patches and
    builtin-apply-patch.
  * Use reload.c revision 1.43 to avoid a nasty bug.

egcs (1.1b-3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU to fix the egcc -> gcc link once and for all

 -- Christopher C. Chimelis <chris@classnet.med.miami.edu>  Tue, 22 Sep 1998 16:11:19 -0500

egcs (1.1b-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops. The egcc -> gcc link on archs where gcc is egcc was broken.
    Thanks to Chris Chimelis for pointing this out.

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Mon, 21 Sep 1998 20:51:35 +0200

egcs (1.1b-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream spellfix release (Debian revision is 2 as the internal
    version numbers didn't change).
  * Added egcc -> gcc symlink on architectures where egcc is the primary C
    compiler. Thus, maintainers of packages that require egcc, can now
    simply use "egcc" without conditionals.
  * Porters: we hope/plan to make egcs's gcc the default C compiler on all
    platforms once the 2.2.x kernels are available. Please test this version
    thoroughly, and give us a GO / NO GO for your architecture.
  * Some symbols cpp used to predefine were removed upstream in order to clean
    up the cpp namespace, but imake requires them for determining the proper
    settings for LinuxMachineDefines (see /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/{Imake,linux}.cf),
    thus we put them back. Thanks to Paul Slootman for reporting his imake
    problems on Alpha.
    * [gcc/config/alpha/linux.h] Added -D__alpha to CPP_PREDEFINES .
      Thanks to Chris Chimelis for the alpha-only 1.1a-1.1 NMU which fixed
      this already.
    * [gcc/config/i386/linux.h] Added -D__i386__ to CPP_PREDEFINES .
    * [gcc/config/sparc/linux.h] Has -Dsparc in CPP_PREDEFINES .
    * [gcc/config/sparc/linux64.h] Has -Dsparc in CPP_PREDEFINES .
    * [gcc/config/m68k/linux.h] Has -Dmc68000 in CPP_PREDEFINES .
    * [gcc/config/rs6000/linux.h] Has -Dpowerpc in CPP_PREDEFINES .
    * [gcc/config/arm/linux.h] Has -Darm in CPP_PREDEFINES .
    * [gcc/config/i386/gnu.h] Has -Di386 in CPP_PREDEFINES .
  * Small fixes and updates in README.
  * Changes affecting the source package only:
    * [gcc/Makefile.in, gcc/cp/Make-lang.in, gcc/p/Make-lang.in]
      Daniel Jacobowitz: Ugly hacks of various kinds to make cplib2.txt get
      properly regenerated with multilib.
    * [debian/TODO] Created.
    * [INSTALL/index.html] Fixed broken link.

 -- Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Aug 1998 13:20:59 +0200

egcs-snapshot (19980729-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New snapshot version 19980729 from CVS archive.
  * New gpc snapshot gpc-980729.
  * Let gcc/configure decide about using the Haifa scheduler.
  * Remove -DDEBIAN. That was needed for the security improvements with
    regard to the /tmp problem. egcs-1.1 chooses another approach.
  * Save test-protocol and extract gpc errors to gpc-test-summary.
  * Tighten binutils dependency to 2.9.1.

egcs-snapshot (19980721-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Unreleased. Infinite loops in executables made by gpc.

 -- Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Jul 1998 18:07:20 +0200

egcs-snapshot (19980715-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New snapshot version from CVS archive.
  * New gpc snapshot gpc-980715.
  * New libg++ version libg++-2.8.2-980708. Changed versioning
    schema for library. The major versions of libc, libstdc++ and the
    g++ interface are coded in the library name. Use this new schema,
    but provide a symlink to our previous schema, since the library
    seems to be binary compatible.
  * [debian/rules]: Fixed bug in build target, when bootstrap returns
    with an error

 -- Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Jul 1998 10:55:05 +0200

egcs-snapshot (19980701-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New snapshot version from CVS archive.
    Two check programs in libg++ had to be manually killed to finish the
    testsuite (tBag and tSet).
  * New gpc snapshot gpc-980629.
  * Incorporated debian/rules changes from egcs-1.0.3a-0.5 (but don't remove
    gcc/cp/parse.c gcc/c-parse.c gcc/c-parse.y gcc/objc/objc-parse.c
    gcc/objc/objc-parse.y, since these files are part of the release).
  * Disable the -DMKTEMP_EACH_FILE -DHAVE_MKSTEMP -DDEBIAN flags for the
    snapshot. egcs-1.1 will have another solution.
  * Don't bootstrap the snapshot with -fno-force-mem. Internal compiler
    error :-(
  * libf2c.a and f2c.h have changed names to libg2c.a and g2c.h and
    have moved again into the gcc-lib dir. They are installed under
    libg2c.a and g2c.h. Is it necessary to provide links f2c -> g2c ?
  * debian/rules: reflect change of build dir of libraries.

 -- Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>  Wed,  2 Jul 1998 13:15:28 +0200

egcs-snapshot (19980628-0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot version.
  * Non-maintainer upload; Matthias appears to be absent currently.
  * Updated shlibs.
  * Merged changes from regular egcs:
    * [debian/control] Tightened dependency on binutils to 2.8.1.0.23 or
      newer, as according to INSTALL/SPECIFIC PowerPC (and possibly Sparc)
      need this.
    * [debian/rules] Clean up some generated files outside builddir,
      so the .diff.gz becomes smaller.
    * [debian/rules] Partial sync/update with the one for the regular egcs
      version.
  * [debian/rules] Make gcc/p/configure executable.

egcs (1.0.3a-0.6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Some libg++ development files were in libstdc++2.8-dev rather than
    libg++2.8-dev. Fixed this and dealt with upgrading from the earlier
    versions (fixes #23908; this bug is not marked release-critical, but
    is annoying and can be quite confusing for users. Therefore, I think
    this fix should go in 2.0).

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Tue, 30 Jun 1998 11:10:14 +0200

egcs (1.0.3a-0.5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed location of .hP files (Fixes #23448).
  * [debian/rules] simplified extraction of the files for libg++2.8-dev.

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Wed, 17 Jun 1998 09:33:41 +0200

egcs (1.0.3a-0.4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * [gcc/gcc.c] There is one call to choose_temp_base for determining the
    tempdir to be used only; #ifdef HAVE_MKSTEMP delete the tempfile created
    as a side effect. (fixes #23123 for egcs).
  * [gcc/collect2.c] There's still a vulnerability here; I don't see how
    I can fix it without leaving behind tempfiles though.
  * [debian/control] Tightened dependency on binutils to 2.8.1.0.23 or
    newer, as according to INSTALL/SPECIFIC PowerPC (and possibly Sparc)
    need this.
  * [debian/rules] Clean up some generated files outside builddir, so the
    .diff.gz becomes smaller.

egcs (1.0.3a-0.3) frozen unstable; urgency=high (security fixes)

  * [gcc/toplev.c] set flag_force_mem to 1 at optimisation level 3 or higher.
    This works around #17768 which is considered release-critical.
  * Changes by Matthias:
    * [debian/README] Documentation of the compiler situation for Objective C.
    * [debian/rules, debian/control.*] Generate control file from a master
      file.
    * [debian/rules] Updates for Pascal and Fortran parts; brings it in sync
      with the one for the egcs snapshots.
  * Use the recommended settings LDFLAGS=-s CFLAGS= BOOT_CFLAGS='-O2'.
  * Really compile -DMKTEMP_EACH_FILE -DHAVE_MKSTEMP (really fixes #19453
    for egcs).
  * [gcc/gcc.c] A couple of temp files weren't marked for deletion.

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Sun, 31 May 1998 22:56:22 +0200

egcs (1.0.3a-0.2) frozen unstable; urgency=high (security fixes)

  * Security improvements with regard to the /tmp problem
    (gcc opens predictably named files in TMPDIR which can be abused via
    symlinks)  (Fixes #19453 for egcs).
    * Compile -DMKTEMP_EACH_FILE to ensure the %u name is generated randomly
      every time; affects gcc/gcc.c .
    * [gcc/choose-temp.c, libiberty/choose-temp.c]: use mktemp(3) if compiled
      -DUSE_MKSTEMP .
    * Security improvements: don't use the result of choose_temp_base in a
      predictable fashion.
      [gcc/gcc.c]:
      * @c, @objective-c: use random name rather then tempbasename.i for
        intermediate preprocessor output (%g.i -> %d%u).
      * @c, @objective-c: use random name rather then tempbasename.s for
        intermediate compiler output (%g.s -> %d%u).
      * @c, @objective-c, @cpp-output, @assembler-with-cpp: switched
        "as [-o output file] <input file>" to
        "as <input file> [-o output file]".
      * @c, @objective-c, @assembler-with-cpp: use previous random name
        (cc1|cpp output) rather then tempbasename.s for intermediate assembler
        input (%g.s -> %U)
      [gcc/f/lang-specs.h]:
      * @f77-cpp-input: use random name rather then tempbasename.i for
        intermediate cpp output (%g.i -> %d%u).
      * @f77-cpp-input: use previous random name (cpp output) rather than
        tempbasename.i for f771 input (%g.i -> %U).
      * @f77-cpp-input: switched
        "as [-o output file] <input file>" to
        "as <input file> [-o output file]".
      * @f77-cpp-input: use random name rather then tempbasename.s for
        intermediate compiler output (%g.s -> %d%u).
      * @ratfor: use random name rather then tempbasename.i for
        intermediate ratfor output (%g.f -> %d%u).
      * @ratfor: use previous random name (ratfor output) rather than
        tempbasename.i for f771 input (%g.f -> %U).
      * @ratfor: use random name rather then tempbasename.s for
        intermediate compiler output (%g.s -> %d%u).
      * @ratfor: switched
        "as [-o output file] <input file>" to
        "as <input file> [-o output file]".
      * @ratfor: use previous random name
        (ratfor output) rather then tempbasename.s for intermediate assembler
        input (%g.s -> %U).
      * @f77: use random name rather then tempbasename.s for
        intermediate ratfor output (%g.f -> %d%u).
      * @ratfor: use previous random name (ratfor output) rather than
        tempbasename.i for f771 input (%g.f -> %U).
      * @ratfor: use random name rather then tempbasename.s for
        intermediate compiler output (%g.s -> %d%u).
      * @ratfor: switched
        "as [-o output file] <input file>" to
        "as <input file> [-o output file]".
      * @ratfor: use previous random name
        (ratfor output) rather then tempbasename.s for intermediate assembler
        input (%g.s -> %U).
      * @f77: use random name rather then tempbasename.s for
        intermediate compiler output (%g.s -> %d%u).
      * @f77: switched
        "as [-o output file] <input file>" to
        "as <input file> [-o output file]".
      * @ratfor: use random name rather then tempbasename.s for
        intermediate compiler output (%g.s -> %U).
  * Run the testsuite (this requires the dejagnu package in experimental;
    unfortunately, it is difficult to distinguish this version from the one
    in frozen).
    if possible, and log the results in warn_summary and bootstrap-summary.
  * [gcc/choose-temp.c, libiberty/choose-temp.c]: s|returh|return| in
    comment.
  * Added notes on the Debian compiler setup [debian/README] to the
    development packages.
  * Matthias:
    * [libg++/etc/lf/Makefile.in] Replaced "-ltermcap" by "-lncurses".
    * [debian/rules] Updated so it can be used for both egcs releases and
      snapshots easily; added support for the GNU Pascal Compiler gpc.
    * [contrib/test_summary, contrib/warn_summary] Added from CVS.
    * Run compiler checks and include results in /usr/doc/<package>.
    * Updates to the README.
    * [debian/rules] Use assignments to speed up startup.
  * [debian/rules] Show the important variables at the start of the build
    process.
  * [debian/control.secondary] Added a dependency of gobjc on egcc on
    architectures where egcs provides the secondary compiler, as
    /usr/bin/egcc is the compiler driver for gobjc. (Fixes #22829).
  * [debian/control.*] Bumped Standards-Version; used shorter version
    numbers in the dependency relationships (esthetic difference only);
    fixed typo.

egcs-snapshot (19980517-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * "Initial" release of the egcs-snapshot package; many debian/* files
    derived from the egcs-1.0.3a-0.1 package (maintained by Galen Hazelwood
    <galenh@micron.net>, NMU's by J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>)
  * The egcs-snapshot packages can coexist with the packages of the
    egcs release. Package names have a '-ss' appended.
  * All packages are installed in a separate tree (/usr/lib/egcs-ss following
    the FHSS).
  * Made all snapshot packages extra, all snapshot packages conflict
    with correspondent egcs packages, which are newer than the snapshot.
  * Included libg++-2.8.1-980505.
  * Included GNU Pascal (gpc-980511).
  * Haifa scheduler enabled for all snapshot packages.
  * Run compiler checks and include results in /usr/doc/<package>.
  * Further information in /usr/doc/<package>/README.snapshot.

egcs (1.0.3a-0.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
    (we were using 1.0.3-prerelease).  This includes the Haifa patches
    we had since 1.0.3-0.2 and the gcc/objc/thr-posix.c patch we had
    since 1.0.3-0.1; the differences with 1.0.3-prerelease + patches
    we had is negligable.
  * iostream info documentation was in the wrong package (libg++2.8-dev).
    Now it's in libstdc++2.8-dev. (Thanks to Jens Rosenboom for bringing
    this to my attention). As 1.0.3-0.3 didn't make it out of Incoming,
    I'm not adding "Replaces:" for this; folks who had 1.0.3-0.3 installed
    already know enough to use --force-overwrite.
  * [gcc/objc/objc-act.c] Applied patch Matthias Klose supplied me with that
    demangles Objective C method names in gcc error messages.
  * Explicitly disable Haifa scheduling on Alpha, to make it easier to use
    this package's diff with egcs snapshots, which may turn on Haifa
    scheduling even though it is still unstable. (Requested by Chris Chimelis)
  * Don't run "configure" again if builddir already exists (makes it faster
    to restart builds in case one is hacking internals). Requested by
    Johnnie Ingram.
  * [gcc/gbl-ctors.h] Don't use extern declaration for atexit on glibc 2.1
    and higher (the prototype has probably changed; having the declaration
    broke Sparc compiles).
  * [debian/rules] Determine all version number automatically (from the
    version string in gcc/version.c).
  * [debian/copyright] Updated FTP locations; added text about libg++ (fixes
    #22465).

egcs (1.0.3-0.3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Made an "egcs-doc" package containing documentation for egcs (e)gcc,
    g++, gobjc, so that administrators can choose whether to have this
    documenation or the documentation that comes with the GNU gcc package.
    Dependency on this is Recommends: on architectures where egcs provides
    the primary C compiler; Suggests: on the others (where GNU gcc is still
    the primary C compiler).
  * Use the g++ FAQ from gcc/cp rather than libg++, as that version is more
    up to date.
  * Added iostream info documentation to libstdc++2.8-dev.

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Wed, 13 May 1998 08:46:10 +0200

egcs (1.0.3-0.2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added libg++ that works with egcs, found at
    ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/hjl/libg++-2.8.1-980505.tar.gz
    (fixes #20587 (Severity: important)).
  * The "libg++" and "libg++-dev" virtual packages now refer to the GNU
    extensions.
  * Added the g++ FAQ that comes with libg++ to the g++ package.
  * libg++/Makefile.in: added $(srcdir) to rule for g++FAQ.info so that it
    builds OK in builddir.
  * Added -D__i386__ to the cpp predefines on intel.
  * Patches Matthias supplied me with:
    * Further 1.0.3 prerelease patches from CVS.
      This includes patches to the Haifa scheduler. Alpha porters, please
      check if this makes the Haifa scheduler OK again.
    * Objective C patches from CVS.

egcs (1.0.3-0.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low (high for maintainers that use objc)

  * bug fixes only in new upstream version
  * Applied patches from egcs CVS archive (egcs_1_03_prerelease)
    (see gcc/ChangeLog in the egcs source package).
  * libstdc++2.8-dev no longer Provides: libg++-dev (fixes #21153).
  * libstdc++2.8-dev now Conflicts: libg++27-dev (bo),
    libg++272-dev (hamm) [regular packages] rather than
    Conflicts: libg++-dev [virtual package] to prepare the way for "libg++"
    to be used as a virtual package for a new libg++ package (i.e. an up to
    date one, which not longer contains libstdc++, but only the GNU
    extensions) that is compatible with the egcs g++ packages. Such a package
    isn't available yet. Joel Klecker tried building libg++2.8.1.1a within
    egcs's libstdc++ setup, but it appears to need true gcc 2.8.1 .
  * Filed Severity: important bugs against wxxt1-dev (#21707) because these
    still depend on libg++-dev, which is removed in this version.
    A fixed libsidplay1-dev has already been uploaded.
  * libstdc++2.8 is now Section: base and Priority: required (as dselect is
    linked against it).
  * Disabled Haifa scheduling on Alpha again; Chris Chimelis reported
    that this caused problems on some machines.
  * [gcc/extend.texi]
    ftp://maya.idiap.ch/pub/tmb/usenix88-lexic.ps.Z is no longer available;
    use http://master.debian.org/~karlheg/Usenix88-lexic.pdf .
    (fixes the egcs part of #20002).
  * Updated Standards-Version.
  * Changed chmod in debian/rules at Johnie Ingram's request.
  * Rather than hardwire the Debian part of the packages' version number,
    extract it from debian/changelog .
  * Use gcc/objc/thr-posix.c from 980418 egcs snapshot to make objc work.
    (Fixes #21192).
  * Applied workaround for the GNUstep packages on sparc systems.
    See README.sparc (on sparc packages only) in the doc directory.
    This affects the other compilers as well.
  * Already done in 1.0.2-0.7: the gobjc package now provides a virtual
    package objc-compiler.

 -- Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Apr 1998 10:25:48 +0200

egcs (1.0.2-0.6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Due to upstream changes (libg++ is now only the GNU specific C++
    classes, and is no longer maintained; libstdc++ contains the C++
    standard library, including STL), the virtual "libg++-dev"
    package's meaning has become confusing. Therefore, new or updated
    packages should no longer use the virtual "libg++-dev" package.
  * Corrected g++'s Recommends to libstdc++2.8-dev (>=2.90.27-0.1).
    The previous version had Recommends: libstdc++-dev (>=2.90.27-0.1)
    which doesn't work, as libstc++-dev is a virtual package.
  * Bumped Standards-Version.

egcs (1.0.2-0.5) frozen unstable; urgency=low (high for maintainers of packages that use libstdc++)

  * Modified shlibs file for libstdc++ to generate versioned dependencies,
    as it is not link compatible with the 1.0.1-x versions in
    project/experimental. (Fixes #20247, #20033)
    Packages depending on libstd++ should be recompiled to fix their
    dependencies.
  * Strenghtened g++'s Recommends: libstdc++-dev to the 1.0.2 version or
    newer.
  * Fixed problems with the unknown(7) symlink for gcov.
  * Reordering links now works.

 -- Adam Heath <adam.heath@usa.net>  Sun, 12 Apr 1998 13:09:30 -0400

egcs (1.0.2-0.4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Unreleased. This is the version Adam Heath received from me.
  * Replaces: gcc (<= 2.7.2.3-3) so that the overlap with the older gcc
    packages (including bo's gcc_2.7.2.1-8) is handled properly
    (fixes #19931, #19672, #20217, #20593).
  * Alpha architecture (fixes #20875):
    * Patched gcc/config/alpha/linux.h for the gmon functions to operate
      properly.
    * Made egcs the primary C compiler.
    * Enabled Hafia scheduling.
  * Lintian-detected problems:
    * E: libstdc++2.8: ldconfig-symlink-before-shlib-in-deb usr/lib/libstdc++.so.2.8
    * E: egcc: binary-without-manpage gcov
      Reported as wishlist bug; added link to undocumented(7).

  * Security improvements with regard to the /tmp problem
    (gcc opens predictably named files in TMPDIR which can be abused via

    * Compile -DMKTEMP_EACH_FILE to ensure the %u name is generated randomly
      every time; affects gcc/gcc.c .
    * [cp/g++.c, collect2.c, gcc.c] If compiled -DHAVE_MKSTEMP use mkstemp(3)
      rather than mktemp(3).
    * Security improvements: don't use the result of choose_temp_base in a
      predictable fashion.
