xf86-input-wacom (0.15.0+20120515-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the old udev rules file that was orphaned by dh_installudev fail
    if it remains unmodified.  If it was modified, people will need to edit
    and keep their own rules there anyway.  Closes: #565126

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Oct 2012 23:38:24 +1030

xf86-input-wacom (0.15.0+20120515-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot.  Closes: #656563  Possibly Closes: #658053

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 23 May 2012 08:50:01 +0930

xf86-input-wacom (0.12.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adds support for many new devices, and better support for finger input.
    Closes: #649266   Possibly Closes: #641954
  * Restores support for WALTOP, the kernel patches are mainlined now.
  * Support for input ABI 14.
  * Fixes for key device handling.  Closes: #632117
    Probably Closes: #639384, #617860, #617870
    Possibly Closes: #632416
  * Many fixes for twinview and rotation.
    Possibly Closes: #483494, #526050, #626248
    Please reopen with updated information if not.
  * Add libx11 and libxinerama Build-Deps.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Nov 2011 07:17:17 +1030

xf86-input-wacom (0.11.0+20110419-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot.  Add libudev Build-Dep.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon, 09 May 2011 21:50:28 +0930

xf86-input-wacom (0.10.10+20110203-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix udev rules for serial tablets.  Closes: #589847, #609931
  * Fixes relative mode sensitivity.  Closes: #611502
  * Fixes TwinView by purging it.  Closes: #571023, #571025
  * Build with the xorg 1.9 packages now about to come out of experimental.
    Closes: #607355
  * Fix a bug in xsetwacom that displayed the usage() twice.  Closes: #612122

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 06 Feb 2011 11:58:40 +1030

xf86-input-wacom (0.10.5+20100416-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Normalise pressure sensitivity.  This helps avoid a heavily used stylus
    from inadvertantly generating a click when brought into proximity due
    to its initial unloaded pressure value creeping up.
  * Use pkg-config to decide where to install 20-wacom.conf.  Closes: #578113
    Proper detection of this in the upstream install means we don't need to
    manually remove the .fdi anymore either.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Apr 2010 17:40:38 +0930

xf86-input-wacom (0.10.5+20100415-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move 10-wacom.conf to 20-wacom.conf, as merged upstream.
  * Add xutils-dev to B-D, for xorg-macros.pc
    It doesn't seem to actually cause any problems to have that missing,
    but it does bark in the build logs and we may be using things from it
    in the not too distant future now.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Apr 2010 17:31:12 +0930

xf86-input-wacom (0.10.5+20100414-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replace the hardcoded rotation tables with a single call to atan2.
  * Many fixes for wheels, buttons, and tabletpc devices.
  * Fix scrolling issues with Intuos3 by ensuring the pad always operates
    in relative mode.
  * Lots of fixes for xsetwacom.
  * Switch from udev to xorg.conf.d snippets.
    Add udev rules to claim the serial tablets.
    Thanks to Timo Aaltonen for passing along patches and testing of these.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Apr 2010 22:24:07 +0930

xf86-input-wacom (0.10.3+20100109-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, now supports server/udev among many fixes.
  * xsetwacom is back from the dead again.
  * Push our udev rules down to run after 65-xorg-evdev.rules

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 09 Jan 2010 18:40:47 +1030

xf86-input-wacom (0.10.2+20091203-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pull a new upstream snapshot with some fixes for button issues, and more.
  * Add the udev rules back, tweaked for post-hal hotplugging support with X.
  * Add build-deps for x11proto-kb-dev, libxkbfile-dev.  The new upstream now
    #includes xorg/xkbstr.h from xserver-xorg-dev, which in current Sid then
    in turn #includes X11/extensions/XKB.h and X11/extensions/XKBproto.h from
    x11proto-kb-dev and X11/extensions/XKMformat.h from libxkbfile-dev.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 05 Dec 2009 23:51:33 +1030

xf86-input-wacom (0.10.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Great Leap Forward.
  * Restructure the package to only contain the Xorg driver.
    The kernel driver has been regularly merged with mainline for quite some
    time already, and the Xorg driver is moving closer to upstream now too,
    so we can drop any pretense of this still being an agglomeration of things
    or of needing to be one, and simply tack the packaging needed for X onto a
    real git repo.  Anything else can go in its own package and/or repo.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Nov 2009 01:03:15 +1030

wacom-tools (0.8.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include fdi support for HAL.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Apr 2009 04:03:15 +0930

wacom-tools (0.8.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, supports the xorg 1.6 API changes.
    Drops support for 2.4 kernels and some early 2.6 ones too.
    Closes: #513052, #516451
  * Add es.po, thanks to Fernando González de Requena.  Closes: #520544
  * Add a few new tablets to the udev rules.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Mar 2009 16:56:27 +1030

wacom-tools (0.8.1.6-1+) experimental; urgency=low

  * Same source as -1, but targetted at xorg1.5 in experimental.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri, 31 Oct 2008 23:25:59 +1030

wacom-tools (0.8.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated udev rules, factored out many common tests and added support
    for tabletpc devices with multiple interfaces.
  * Updated sv.po, thanks again to Martin Bagge.   Closes: #503354

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Oct 2008 22:18:53 +1030

wacom-tools (0.8.1.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Experimental upload for testing with xorg 1.5  Closes: #493976
  * Update sv.po, thanks to Martin Bagge.          Closes: #483769

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Oct 2008 16:37:42 +0930

wacom-tools (0.8.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a regression to the dlloader test (again).  Closes: #481720

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon, 19 May 2008 19:19:53 +0930

wacom-tools (0.8.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes a crash with XServer 1.4  Closes: #454568
  * Be explicit about using bash.   Closes: #459166
  * Update nl.po, thanks to Vincent Zweije and debian-l10n-dutch.
    Closes: #464448
  * Split lintian-overrides into two files because lintian barfs if the
    entries for different packages are all kept together.  *unf*
  * Bump the debhelper minimum version to 6.0.7 for dh_lintian, and
    bump compat to 6 if we are going to be forced to depend on it anyhow.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 17 May 2008 06:35:40 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.9.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make xserver-xorg-input-wacom conflict/replace the earlier wacom-tools
    packages because the wacom.4 manpage has switched packages.
  * Generate a xserver-xorg-input-wacom.substvars file to manage the XOrg
    version provides and dependencies.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 02 Dec 2007 11:16:28 +1030

wacom-tools (0.7.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, includes support for XOrg 7.3/1.4
    Closes: #442424, #443032
  * Don't overrun padkey_codes[] when iterating through it.  Closes: #447681
  * Move the wacom(4) man page to the xserver-xorg-input-wacom package.
    Closes: #440164
  * Include the new text and translations courtesy of the Smith Review.
    With a big thanks to everyone who contributed to that!
    Closes: #443956, #444561, #444672, #444762, #445024, #445519, #445796
    Closes: #446135, #446402, #446440, #446576, #446717
  * Tidy the debian/copyright file.  Closes: #451647
  * Add Provides: xserver-xorg-input-2 so the next X ABI transition will be
    a bit less painful for people.
  * Update the udev rules for new tablets.  Lower-case the product ids since
    udev appears to be case sensitive doing string compares for hex values.
    Nice one guys.
  * Add a build-dep for pkg-config, it appears to have infected XOrg now too.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 02 Dec 2007 08:32:45 +1030

wacom-tools (0.7.7.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Include upstream documentation like the man page says we do.
    I guess nobody ever read it before ;-)  Closes: #427689

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 06 Jun 2007 18:50:46 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.7.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reapply the patch to fix 64/32 bit cross builds, that seems to have
    been lost or misapplied too.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon, 04 Jun 2007 17:15:35 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.7.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't depend on the xorg module dir actually existing when
    --with-xmoduledir is used (again).  This is an upstream regression
    to the patch submitted for 0.7.4.1-3.  Closes: #427428

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon, 04 Jun 2007 15:09:29 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.7.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Closes: #396883, #415244, #422532
  * Update vi.po, thanks to Clytie Siddall. Closes: #427020
  * Drop the external module package, upstream seems to be syncing fairly
    regularly with the mainstream kernel team again, so this should not
    be needed by most people, and causes confusion and trouble for the rest.
    Closes: #418008, #417140, #404471, #317287
  * Lintian now bitches about reusing DH_COMPAT for the source package, so
    I guess we now need to clutter the debian/ dir with files for each use
    of the /rules.  *sigh*  This seems a bit _too_ pedantic to me.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 02 Jun 2007 23:51:51 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.4.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

    coordinating this 'final' update for etch.
    - German. Closes: #398671
    - Galician. Closes: #407897

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Feb 2007 23:49:53 +1030

wacom-tools (0.7.4.1-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high because only one line of code has changed and it
    fixes a FTBFS with xorg7.1 -- broken or not.

  * Backported change from upstream cvs to remove unneccessary #include
    (for any version of xorg/xfree), that breaks builds with xorg7.1.
    cf. #388776

  * Updated fr.po, thanks to Jean-Luc Coulon and debian-l10n-french.
    Closes: #367224
  * Updated cs.po, thanks to Miroslav Kure.
    Closes: #384761
  * Added nl.po, thanks to Vincent Zweije and debian-l10n-dutch.
    Closes: #388312
  * Added sv.po, thanks to Daniel Nylander.
    Closes: #389022

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Oct 2006 18:26:26 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.4.1-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Make check_driver executable, even after it's been reconstituted
    from a diff.gz.  Closes: #384873

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Aug 2006 19:45:29 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replace the quick fix from -2 with some better autodetection,
    and an option to explicitly supply the xorg module dir, which
    we can't check without build-depending on X runtime packages.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 18 May 2006 15:33:23 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quick and dirty hack to workaround the failing 'dlloader' detection.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 16 May 2006 23:35:37 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New linuxwacom release.  Better support for PenPartner, DTF-521
    and xorg7.  Kernel 2.6 < 2.6.8 no longer supported.
  * Remove patches incorporated upstream.
  * Specify xorg-sdk and xlib locations explicitly still to avoid
    linuxwacom trying to install to lib64 if a 64bit kernel is found.
    It can be worked around for 64 bit builds, but totally breaks
    building in a ia32 chroot on such a machine if we don't do this.
  * Disable building the kernel module with the support libs
    (or at least, try to).
  * Switch to DH_COMPAT level 5.
  * Fix the product id for DTF-720.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 14 May 2006 15:30:26 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.3.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move the check_driver RUN script to /lib/udev, and shave a few cycles
    from each time it is called.  Thanks to MD for checking it over.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 13 May 2006 17:13:03 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update the wacom-kernel-modules package for the change in kernel
    package names.  Reported as a followup to #317288, but this does
    not solve the original issue of upgrading a kernel without a change
    in the kernel version.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 13 May 2006 16:36:42 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the old udev rules in the postinst if they are unmodified.
    Bark at the user to remove them if they have been changed locally.
    Being conffiles, they are not removed on upgrade, even if they
    are no longer provided by the package.  But newer udev barfs on
    them, so we have to do something to get them out of the picture.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri, 12 May 2006 23:10:45 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * May Day, May Day.
  * Add missing build-dep for libxi-dev.  Closes: #365538

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon,  1 May 2006 13:31:03 +0930

wacom-tools (0.7.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source.
  * The previous device snatching code will not work with
    kernel 2.6.13+, time to see what 2.6.16 has to offer
    in its place.  Closes: #350663
  * Build the wacom_drv module for xorg7, it is no longer
    supplied as part of the xorg source package.
  * Fix udev rules, again, it may still be a moving target,
    but let's hope its getting a little tired of ducking
    and weaving too.  We now provide a convenience link to
    /dev/input/wacom for users of a single tablet, and named
    links for the convenience of users with multiple tablets
    of different types.  Users with multiple tablets of the
    same type will need to bind them to the /dev/input/by-path
    nodes that correspond to each tablet.
    Closes: #324391, #358057
  * Re-implemented device rebinding from userspace, using a
    udev RUN rule and a small script to check and rebind
    if required.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Apr 2006 00:59:34 +0930

wacom-tools (0.6.6-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added cs.po, thanks to Miroslav Kure.  Closes: #314986
  * Added jp.po, thanks to TANAKA Atushi.  Closes: #322411
  * Fixed typo in debconf template (closes: #324086), and
    added vi.po, thanks to Clytie Siddall. Closes: #324087
  * Only set KSRC to a simple default if it is not already
    set.  (cf. #315130 and #341823)
  * Rip out obsolete FLAVOUR support in line with similar
    changes to kernel-package.
  * Remove unused dh_* boilerplate.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Jun 2005 16:10:52 +0930

wacom-tools (0.6.6-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * The promised new upstream is still in limbo, so in the
    meantime, s/kdist_config/kdist_configure/
    Closes: #296168, #314739
  * Look for the docs in the correct source location when
    installing them to the binary package.  Closes: #300579
  * And don't pretend they are html.  That is just far too
    surprising for popular taste.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Jun 2005 00:37:25 +0930

wacom-tools (0.6.6-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restore build-dep on libx11-dev, despite reports to the
    contrary libxt-dev alone is evidently not sufficient.
    Closes: #294960

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Feb 2005 10:52:07 +1030

wacom-tools (0.6.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Punt device snatching out to userspace via sysfs, it's the only
    way to be sure at present.  This is an(other) experimental
    implementation before the core kernel api is decided and only
    available for kernel 2.6.10 and later at this stage.
  * Add a udev rule to create /dev/input/wacom* for each
    wacom tablet device plugged in to the system.  Its a conffile
    so you can hard code your own device id's there if you want
    constant names that don't depend on the number of wacom devices
    you have and the order you plug them in.
  * Add a hotplug script to poke the module device snatching code.
  * Typo fix in 2.6.7/wacom.c Closes: #294642 thanks.
  * Patch missing functions into 2.6.8/wacom.c, I have a report
    that this works for people who really need it.  Closes: #287941
  * Add debhelper build-dep to the module package.  Closes: #290721
  * Add libx11 build-dep too until this is fixed properly upstream,
    and a dep on build-essential Closes: #288238 thanks.
  * Does not close #286111, nor can I reproduce it still.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Feb 2005 16:27:21 +1030

wacom-tools (0.6.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * First crack at the device snatching patch.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Jan 2005 18:00:40 +1030

wacom-tools (0.6.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed evdev patch since what it attempts to do is
    already handled in the kernel for cases where it might
    reliably work.

    Removed usbhid patch since we can get in before it
    without needing to manually maintain a list of 'quirks'.

    Removed mousedev and usbmouse patches, since the former
    is now built into 2.6 kernels anyway and cannot easily
    be replaced on the fly, and since this is simply the wrong
    approach to fixing the problem of dynamic device naming
    for generic devices IMO, it just hides it for some people
    until they buy another device.

    This and tested support for kernel 2.6, Closes: #281230
    and more...

  * Explicitly point configure at the kernel source.  Closes: #285206

  * Update the other libtool goop as well to fix FTBFS
    on mips and mipsel.  Closes: #285213

  * (ab)use a shared 'confdir' (and worse) to restore something like
    the functionality needed by wacom.modutils for wacom.modprobe
    until we can fix the kernel.  Don't try this at home kids, it is
    surely not best practice in any of the domains it kludges through.
    Though its as legal as falling asleep sober at the wheel ...

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Dec 2004 16:12:07 +1030

wacom-tools (0.6.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

wacom-tools (0.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial trivial packaging.  Note this has only been tested with 2.4.27.
  * Provides the basics from the linuxwacom project -- test and config tools,
    and kernel modules in a convenient form for users of kernel packages.
    It does not provide an updated X11 module, hopefully any important parts
    of that will be ultimately be included by the X maintainers once I look
    at what they might accept.
  * Updated config.{guess,sub}.
  * Modify the version detection to handle a non-numeric suffix
    from --append_to_version or flavour.
  * Closes: #279555
