cdrkit (5:1.0-1) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Eduard Bloch ]
  * ATAPI -> ATA mapping and better error messages (closes: #398465)
  * more reliable FIFO process termination (closes: #398043)
  * prints burn-free message only with higher verbosity (closes: 388770)
  * sorted file list printing, by Dennis Vshivkov (closes: #278071)

  [ Joerg Jaspert ]
  *  Remove all the printing of useless messages. This is based on GPLed
     code, so we follow the letter of the GPL as it is interpreted by 99%
     of the world, including its authors. Especially as Joerg was never able
     to give us any clear explanation what other license he may think
     cdrtools had, despite us asking multiple times. So we have no other
     choice than to take whats written down, and thats GPL.
  * The above fixes "license needs to be clarified" as well as
    "Cdrkit possibly made non-free by former upstream, refuses
    clarification"(Closes: #387783, #392342).
    Note that I do not remove the "You may not return schily" clauses.
    They are, in my understanding, valid requests an upstream can make, not
    including his name if he doesn't want it. They are also no problem for
    anyone, anywhere, the other stuff was.
  * Was included earlier, close Bug "diff for 5:1.0~pre4-1.1 NMU" (Closes: #388595).
  * Bug fix: "wodim: Spelling error in output of -checkdrive", thanks to
    Alexey Feldgendler (Closes: #389135).
  * Urgency high.

    debian/rules. It is a separate project with a mature build system while
    the replacement would need improvements to keep up.

cdrkit (5:1.0~pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Eduard Bloch ]
  * dropped the shm build (kernel 2.2 is history)
  * dropped dpatch integration, we are the upstream now
  * disabled debconf messages and device-creating code for now
    (closes: #326138, #314139); things like hints to create device files are
    essential for only few people and can equaly be presented as program
    messages. Why shall we still MAKEDEV them?  It's not like we have switched
    to kernel 2.0.1 yesterday (closes: #342085, #188827, #200665)
  * updated Build-Dependencies for kfreebsd (closes: #355291)
  * debian/copyright got uptodate mail address for Schilling (closes: #372484)

  [ Eduard Bloch, upstream related changes ] 
  * The Big Fork to an independent project called cdrkit
    + using the last clearly stated GPLed versions of files from
      cdrtools-2.01.01a08 (closes: #353403, #372486)
    + we play the upstream role now, using our patches and we like them
      (closes: #361450)
    + renamed relevant works to avoid claims of "potential defamation" or
      "damage of reputation" (closes: #350738)
    + custom CMake based build system used instead of the original one, since
      we understand it better (closes: #350739 and hopefully closes: #350254,
      reopen if not). It seems to be portable among the platforms
      supported by Debian, it needs a bit of work for porting to non-Linux
      plattforms, though.
  * removed most of the anti-linux2.6  program messages (unless being
    in verbose mode). (closes: #377145)
  * changed default config file location to /etc/default/wodim
  * added more meaningful error message on -dvd-video failure (closes: #324586)
  * minor cdda2mp3/cdda2ogg scripts fixes suggested by Fabian Pietsch, plus
    fixes for unreliable encoder detection (closes: #283794, #344443) plus
    possible override of preset CDDA_DEVICE variable fixed. Made the list of
    selected audiotracks modifiable, see manpage (closes: #344445)
  * sync with 4:2.01+01a01-4ubuntu4:
    + merged README.ATAPI.setup with README.ATAPI.setup.ubuntu. Kernel 2.6 part
      now in the beginning and reflecting the reality (dev=/dev/drive syntax,
      no SUID requirement, closes: #304230, #377736)
    + 02_cdrecord_default_conf.dpatch: changed /dev/cdrom to /dev/cdrw which
      is more likely to match the correct device on udev using systems
  * 36_ATA_scanbus_ignore_locked.dpatch to ignore busy devices (eg. hda
    harddisk) while scanning with dev=ATA 
    (closes: #310689, #309250, #317793, #360295, 
  * Included 37_clean_dvdsup.dpatch (closes: #312062) based on
    cdrtools-2.01.01a04-dvd.patch.bz2 from
    http://people.mandriva.com/~warly/files/cdrtools/ with few updates to work
    with a08. Also implements a fallback to ATA: bus in the -scanbus operation
    (closes: #310689, #278894). This patch is used instead of the old 07_....
    Enabled permanently, disabled the "cheatcode processing" in debian/rules.
    Also eliminates some useability problems that have been pushed to our
    users (closes: #325766, #271114, #312062, #353176).
  * Updated dirsplit to version 0.3.3, zisofs-tools to 1.0.7 (with a custom
    CMakeFile.txt for easier integration and config.h updated manually for
    now)
  * minor cdda2mp3/cdda2ogg scripts fixes suggested by Fabian Pietsch, plus
    fixes for unreliable encoder detection (closes: #283794, #344443) plus
    possible override of preset CDDA_DEVICE variable fixed
  * added additional script manpages from Oleksandr Moskalenko (closes: #295438)
  * changed -speed to speed= in cdrecord.1 for consistency (closes: #344214)
  * Anti-Root-Requirements:
    + 39_nonroot_skips_rezero_unit.dpatch - don't run rezero_unit() as root
    which is a) most likely not needed (even admited in the comment) and b)
    causes the whole scsi transport system to terminate
    + 40_stop_setuid_games.dpatch - another workaround for problems introduced
    in a03 - looks like Linux kernel does reject an application trying to
    change the UID between ioctls
    (closes: #335253, #374685, #330506, #329308, #374345, #377421)
  * Ubuntu's 40_fix_bad_spelling.dpatch integrated (typo in wodim.dfl)
  * increased hash size in mkisofs/hash.c (closes: #327270)
  * more decent info message about locale detection

  [ Joerg Jaspert]:
  * Make build-depends on cmake versioned, to show backporters we need a recent one.
  * Bump build-depends on debhelper.
  * Kill old conflict on xcdroast, that version is no longer in Debian
  * Added a dummy cdrecord package to ease upgrades for our users. Will get removed
    some time after etch released.
  * Cleaned debian/rules a bit.
  * wodim.links: s/cdrecord/wodim/
  * Let cdrkitt-doc conflict/replace old cdrtools-doc
  * Cleaned up postinst for wodim and removed makedev dependency.
  * debhelper level 5, Policy version 3.7.2
  * Moved all buildstamps into the build/ dir

    (closes: #162579) - mkisofs: isoinfo does not accept coalesced options any
                        more. That was always an user error. It works as
                        documented now.
    (closes: #165015) - cdrtools: Patch to work with 2.5.43. (Read AN-1.11a38)
  * finally completely GPL (including libedc!)
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Don't mention DVD-writing in description (Closes: #162660)
  * Removed 01_cdr_gnuisms. gcc defines __linux__, __linux and linux,
    so we dont need to patch it that way (and linux is not POSIX
    compliant (even if it is defined), __linux__ is)
  * Upstream includes ia64 rules, delete that patch.
  * We now have smake in the Archive. Build-Depend on that, because it is
    the make-system Upstream really supports for his packages. (And with it
    we never need to include a patch for missing rules-files again, it creates
    them automagically)    
  * Include a symlink from /etc/cdrecord/* to /etc/default/*, (closes: #159506)
    That makes it easy to find the cdrecord config and still is compatible with
    upstream *and self-compiled* versions of cdr-tools.
  * Removed 03-cdr-mmap patch and use -DUSE_USGSHM in COPTX - it can be so simple
    to be compatible with old kernels.
  * Make cdrecord only executable for users in the cdrom group (mode 4750)
    if it set SUID (Closes: #164283)
  * Updated to 3.5.7.1 standards version.
  * Do not strip options/commandline out of iso-files. That is *NO* security
    risk. It only contains the options used to create the isofile and the name
    of the directory you created the iso (path is truncated to ../) of it.
  * Drop dbs from Build-Depends, use dpatch system.
  * patch to get silo bootable cds will be deleted with next Upstream
    release of cdrtools. Ben wants to fix silo, but as always: patches
    are welcome, we are all low on time. If you use sparc and want
    bootable linux cd's - go on and send patches for silo please. Look
    into README.silo in /usr/share/doc/mkisofs for more details.

  * Group "cdrom" always exists on a Debian system (closes: #63058)
