Description: Basic programs to authenticate using MIT Kerberos
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 This package contains the basic programs to authenticate to MIT Kerberos,
 change passwords, and talk to the admin server (to create and delete
 principals, list principals, etc.).

 This package contains the Kerberos key server (KDC).  The KDC manages all
 authentication credentials for a Kerberos realm, holds the master keys
 for the realm, and responds to authentication requests.  This package
 should be installed on both master and slave KDCs.

 This package contains the Kerberos master server (kadmind), which handles
 account creations and deletions, password changes, and other
 administrative commands via the Kerberos admin protocol.  It also
 contains the command used by the master KDC to propagate its database to
 slave KDCs.  This package is generally only used on the master KDC for a
 Kerberos realm.

Description: Development files for MIT Kerberos without Heimdal conflict
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.

 Most users wishing to build applications against MIT Kerberos should
 install libkrb5-dev.  However, that package conflicts with heimdal-dev.
 This package installs libraries and headers in /usr/include/mit-krb5 and
 /usr/lib/mit-krb5 and can be installed along side heimdal-multidev, which
 provides the same facilities for Heimdal.
