    for the C++ bindings, but keep respective files with suffix
    ".disabled" for potential later re-use. As a side-effect, this
    change also fixes the build failures on i386 and armel.
    Closes: #522706

graphicsmagick (1.1.7-4) unstable; urgency=low

    wand/drawing_wand.c on arm to work around a compiler issue
    when calling variadic functions. Fixes crashes of the test suite
    on arm.

graphicsmagick (1.1.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Replace pre-etch versions of imagemagick to prevent
    file conflicts with miff.4 and quantize.5 man pages during partial
    upgrade. Closes: #351262
  * tests/drawtest.c: Make sure filename strings do not run out of bounds.
  * magick/cache.c: Define as _XOPEN_SOURCE to pull in declarations for
    Unix98 extensions pread() and pwrite().
  * magick/montage.c: Fix bogus modulation of brightness when creating
    shadows around tiles in montage. Instead, drop constant grey shadow
    like current ImageMagick.
  * PerlMagick/t/montage.t: Update reference signatures for montage test
    cases with shadow according to above change.

graphicsmagick (1.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload to official Debian archives. Closes: #345017
  * New upstream version.
  * debian/*: Major overhaul to comply with packaging standards. Apart
    from the changelog, few lines have survived the clean-up. Still, we
    try to ensure smooth upgrade from the previous, unofficial packages.
    Most notable packaging changes:
    + Names of library packages are properly versioned.
    + Name of compatibility package expanded to -imagemagick-compat.
    + Removed compatibility shell script, and replaced with simple
      symlinks to gm. Extra functionality from wrapper was only required
      by old versions of typo3 according to previous maintainers.
    + New compatibility package -libmagick-dev-compat providing wrappers
      for package development.
    + Build separate packages for C++ library.
    + Drop separate -doc package.
    + More verbose package descriptions.
    + Run test suite at build time.
    + Disable support for obsolete libdps. Build-depend on ghostscript
      instead for ps/pdf regression tests.
    + New maintainer.
  * PerlMagick/t/ttf/read.t: Disabled ttf testcase that is known to fail
    because of problems with special characters.
  * magick/{blob.c,command.c,image.c,log.c,utility.c,utility.h}:
    FormatString() was called with unsanitized user input. Introduced
    new helper function FormatStringNumeric() to allow a single numeric
    format expansion. (This is a more complete fix for CAN-2005-0397
    reported against ImageMagick.)
  * magick/attribute.c: Apply missing piece of fix for heap overflow in
    EXIF parser from ImageMagick patch. (CAN-2004-0981)
  * configure.ac, configure: Fix typo that lead to an undefined delegate
    for HTML conversion.
  * magick/constitute.c: Apply upstream fix for potential NULL pointer
    dereference in ReadImage().
  * magick/{delegate.c,symbols.h,tempfile.h,tempfile.c}: When calling
    external delegates, check filename against whitelist of safe
    characters, and pass securely named symlink to delegate if check fails.
    (CVE-2005-4601)
