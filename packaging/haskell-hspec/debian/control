Description: behavior-driven development for Haskell
 Hspec is roughly based on the Ruby library RSpec. However, Hspec is just
 a framework for running HUnit and QuickCheck tests. Compared to other
 options, it provides a much nicer syntax that makes tests very easy to read.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.

Description: behavior-driven development for Haskell; profiling libraries
 Hspec is roughly based on the Ruby library RSpec. However, Hspec is just
 a framework for running HUnit and QuickCheck tests. Compared to other
 options, it provides a much nicer syntax that makes tests very easy to read.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
