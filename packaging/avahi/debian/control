Description: Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains the Avahi Daemon which represents your machine
 on the network and allows other applications to publish and resolve
 mDNS/DNS-SD records.

Description: Avahi DNS configuration tool
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This tool listens on the network for announced DNS servers and passes
 them to resolvconf so it can use them. This is very useful on autoconfigured
 IPv6 networks.

 .
 This tool implements IPv4LL, "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local
 Addresses" (IETF RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP address
 configuration from the link-local 169.254.0.0/16 range without the
 need for a central server. It is primarily intended to be used in
 ad-hoc networks which lack a DHCP server.
