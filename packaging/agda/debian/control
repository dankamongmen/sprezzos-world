Description: dependently typed functional programming language - development libraries
 Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language: It has inductive
 families, which are like Haskell's GADTs, but they can be indexed by values and
 not just types. It also has parameterised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode
 characters, and an interactive Emacs interface (the type checker can assist in
 the development of your code).
 .
 Agda is also a proof assistant: It is an interactive system for writing and
 checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational
 system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per
 Martin-Löf. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based on
 dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram and NuPRL.
 .
 This package contains the normal library files.

 This package contains the emacs interactive development mode for Agda. This
 mode is the preferred way to write Agda code, and offers features such as
 iterative development, refinement, case analysis and so on.

 This package provides a command-line program for type-checking and compiling
 Agda programs. The program can also generate hyperlinked, highlighted HTML
 files from Agda sources.
