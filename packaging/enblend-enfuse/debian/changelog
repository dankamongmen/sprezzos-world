enblend-enfuse (4.0+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Metzler ]
  * New upstream version.
  * Update debian/patches-repack/*.
  * debian/patches:
    - Drop unneeded patch addinfosection.dpatch - included upstream.
  * debian/rules:
    - Don't try to install TODO - no longer shipped upstream.
  * debian/enfuse.install:
    - focus-stacking.info is not installed as a separate file anymore.
  * debian/control:
    - Update build-depends by adding gnuplot transfig tidy ttf-freefont,
      required to build the PDF documentation.
  * Build/ship alternative binaries of enblend and enfuse binaries with OpenMP
    support. They are installed as enblend-mp and enfuse-mp respectively.

  [ Sebastian Harl ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Install NEWS and AUTHORS to all packages.
    - Explicitly en/disable requested features when running configure.
    - Let enblend/enfuse use the Boost filesystem library -- I suppose, this
      is more stable and, possibly, better optimized than the shipped
      fallback implementation.
    - Replace the whatis entry in the enblend/enfuse manpages with something
      meaningful (using sed).
    - Do not compress PDF files.
    - Clean en{blend,fuse}.tpt files created when building the PDF
      documentation.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-depend on libboost-filesystem-dev.
    - Updated Standards-Version to 3.9.1 -- no changes.
    - Build-depend on help2man, required to build the manpages.
    - Build-depend on perl, ghostscript, texlive and
      texlive-generic-recommended, required to build the PDF documentation.
  * debian/rules, debian/enblend.install, debian/enfuse.install:
    - Build and install PDF documentation.
  * Added debian/enblend.doc-base, debian/enfuse.doc-base.
    - … pointing to enblend.pdf and enfuse.pdf respectively.
