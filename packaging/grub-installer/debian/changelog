    - Set a sensible default boot device, so that we aren't installing GRUB
      to installation media which may be removed later.  The disk containing
      /cdrom is very unlikely to be a sensible default.  If we had to fall
      back to (hd0), then we can't tell exactly which disk that is, but if
      /cdrom seems to be a USB stick then (hd0) may not be safe.  If we hit
      either of those checks, then try the disk containing /boot instead
      (closes: #568529).

grub-installer (1.41) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Add support for Ubuntu's lpia architecture ("Low-Power Intel
      Architecture").
  * Upgrade to debhelper v7.

  [ Felix Zielcke ]
  * Add support for /dev/rs/c[0-9]d[0-9] style devices.

  [ Luca Favatella ]
  * Add support for /dev/ad[0-9] and /dev/da[0-9] style devices (for 
    GNU/kFreeBSD).
  * Use grub-pc on GNU/kFreeBSD.

  [ Aurelien Jarno ]
  * Use grub-pc on UFS root filesystem, and don't display the not-mature
    debconf warning in that case.
  * Don't try to update /target/etc/mtab if it is already a symlink.

  * Don't add map/drivemap commands for Windows Vista/7. It breaks
    Windows 7 (LP: #402154).

grub-installer (1.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Use rootnoverify rather than root when chain-loading Microsoft
      operating systems using GRUB Legacy, since we may not be able to mount
      the partition (LP: #10661). From my reading of its code, this doesn't
      seem to be necessary with GRUB 2.
  * Extend rescue mode plugin to cope with GRUB 2.
  * Allow /boot on LVM; this forces use of GRUB 2 (LP: #393432).
  * Adjust partition offsets for GRUB 2. Moving to grub-probe would probably
    be better in the long run, but this works for now. See #473401, #502446.
  * Use search --fs-uuid rather than --fs_uuid in otheros.sh (LP: #396587).

grub-installer (1.38) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Make findfs use the last of any mounts found, in case there's more than
    one due to pilot error in the partitioner (LP: #289101).
  * Use grub-ieee1275 on powerpc, not grub-of which no longer exists.

  [ Max Vozeler ]
  * Use grub2 when ext4 is chosen (closes: #529363).

  [ Felix Zielcke ]
  * Change the debhelper compat level to 7 and bump the build
    dependency.
  * Replace deprecated `dh_clean -k' with `dh_prep'.
  * Remove the lintian overrides, they're no longer needed.
  * Use UUIDs in the grub2 generated menuentrys. (Closes: #473401)
  * Add drivemap in the grub2 generated menuentry for DOS/Windows in
    case a recent grub2 gets installed.
  * Don't pass -y to update-grub. grub-legacy in lenny just prints out a
    warning.

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * Add Felix Zielcke in uploads field and set DM-Upload-allowed to
    allow him to upload.

grub-installer (1.37) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Check dmraid's exit code rather than parsing its output.
    - cciss and ida logical drive numbers may go up to 15, not just 9.
    - Only check for the boot partition being on dmraid if the user allowed
      us to activate dmraid, to cope with cases where dmraid is misdetected
      (LP: #346001).
  * Don't pass the -y option to update-grub if installing grub2 (closes:
    #526089).
