# 00tex.cnf: header of the configuration file for fmtutil.
#
# In Debian, fmtutil.cnf is a file that is generated from
# configuration files in /etc/texmf/fmt.d/.  This file, 00tex.cnf, 
# contains only some comments on how to edit these files.
#
# The text of the comments is Copyright 1998, 1999 by Thomas Esser, it
# is in the Public domain.


# You Customize these file to your needs, e.g.
#   - remove or uncomment formats that you don't need
#   - add your own formats
#   - change default engine / flags for standard formats

# Some notes:
#   1) tex and amstex just load hyphen.tex. No customization.
#   You can have you own customized (via babel's hyphen.cfg)
#   formats on top of plain by using "bplain.tex" instead of
#   plain.tex (see e.g. bplain.ini file for bplain format).
#
#   2) etex loads language.def, not language.dat.
#
#   3) The symbolic link to the right engines (e.g. bplain -> tex)
#      will be generated by the "texlinks" script. So, if you call
#      fmtutil "by hand" and not via texconfig, please also call
#      texlinks afterwards.
# 
#   4) usual comments start with "# ", whereas disabled configurations
#      start with "#! " in this file.

# The format of the table is:

# format	engine		pattern-file	arguments

# The last part of "arguments" must be the name of the file to run
# initex (or another "ini"-engine) on.
