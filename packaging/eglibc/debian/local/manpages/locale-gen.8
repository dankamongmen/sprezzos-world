.SH "NAME" 
locale-gen \(em generates localisation files from templates 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBlocale-gen\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This manual page documents briefly the 
\fBlocale-gen\fP command. 
.PP 
By default, the locale package which provides the base support for 
localisation of libc-based programs does not contain usable localisation 
files for every supported language. This limitation has became necessary 
because of the substantial size of such files and the large number of 
languages supported by libc. As a result, Debian uses a special 
mechanism where we prepare the actual localisation files on the target 
host and distribute only the templates for them. 
.PP 
\fBlocale-gen\fP is a program that reads the file 
\fB/etc/locale.gen\fP and invokes 
\fBlocaledef\fP for the chosen localisation profiles. 
Run \fBlocale-gen\fP after you have modified the \fB/etc/locale.gen\fP file. 
 
 
.SH "FILES" 
.PP 
\fB/etc/locale.gen\fP 
.PP 
The main configuration file, which has a simple format: every 
line that is not empty and does not begin with a # is treated as a 
locale definition that is to be built. 
 
.SH "SEE ALSO" 
.PP 
localedef(1), locale(1), locale.gen(5).
