# Work out which firmware files to include in the image
# Several steps:
#
# 1. Look for packages which contain "firmware" or "microcode" in their package names
# 2. Check each of those packages to see if they contain files in /lib/firmware
# 3. For those that do, add them into the firmware temp tree
# 4. Make images (tar.gz, zip) of that tree
