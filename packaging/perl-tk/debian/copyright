----------------------

This is a set of perl modules which provide access to the Tk graphics
library from perl.

This package was put together by Rob Browning <osiris@cs.utexas.edu>,
from the original sources, which which can be obtained from any CPAN
site.  See the README and INSTALL files for locations, or check out
www.perl.com for all things perl.  The only real change to the
upstream source was the addition of the debian/* files.
