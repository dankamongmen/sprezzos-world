#### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create a new repository with a directory
2. Add files
3. Select "Store your data in the cloud" with the "Remote server" option
4. Enter host, user, directory
5. Select "Use an encrypted rsync repository on the server" (Will there be an option for unencrypted later?)
6. GPG Passphrase prompt comes up for every file

#### What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect to enter a passphase once and then it will sync all files with the remote server.

Instead, it begins syncing the files to the server but prompts for a GPG passphase for every single file.

#### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20121017 precompiled binary on Arch Linux

#### Please provide any additional information below.

Not sure if I'm just missing a setting for GPG, but I would think I should only need to use the web app to configure the remote server.
