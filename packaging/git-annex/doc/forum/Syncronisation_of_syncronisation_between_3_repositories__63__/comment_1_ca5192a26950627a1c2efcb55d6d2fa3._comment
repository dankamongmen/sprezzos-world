git-annex does not currently prevent multiple uploads of the same file to a rsync special remote. It is able to guard against this when uploading to a git remote, since then the remote runs git-annex-shell, which can detect when an upload is already running. You might want to convert your rsync remote to a git remote.

I hope that rsyncing the same file twice at the same time is safe, but it's certianly excessively expensive.
