Description: GTK2 UI debugger and introspector
 Parasite is a debugging and development tool that runs inside your GTK+ 2.x
 application's process. It can inspect your application, giving you detailed
 information on your UI, such as the hierarchy, X window IDs, widget
 properties, and more. You can modify properties on the fly in order to
 experiment with the look of your UI.
