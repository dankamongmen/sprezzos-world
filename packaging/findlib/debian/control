Description: management tool for OCaml libraries
 The "findlib" OCaml library provides a scheme to manage reusable
 software components (packages), and includes tools that support this
 scheme. Packages are collections of OCaml modules for which
 metainformation can be stored. The packages are kept in the
 filesystem hierarchy, but with strict directory structure. The
 library contains functions to look the directory up that stores a
 package, to query metainformation about a package, and to retrieve
 dependency information about multiple packages.
 .
 This package contains a tool (ocamlfind) that allows the user to
 enter queries on the command-line. In order to simplify compilation
 and linkage, there are new frontends, all driven by ocamlfind, for
 the various OCaml compilers that can directly deal with packages.

Description: library for managing OCaml libraries (runtime)
 The "findlib" OCaml library provides a scheme to manage reusable
 software components (packages), and includes tools that support this

 This package contains files that are or may be needed at runtime by
 programs using findlib (META files and dynamically-loadable files).

Description: Makefile and META wizard for OCaml libraries
 This wizard helps you creating Makefiles and META files for simple
 OCaml library projects. It generates a Makefile, and the Makefile
 produces the META file. This generated build system is a starting
 point and can be later fine-tuned.
