xaw3d (1.5+E-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed libc5 stuff. It currently require a xlib6-altdev pkg which is not
    currently available in xfree86. A control.oldlib has been preserved
    for eventual future use.
    A whishlist bug is required (to be reassigned to xfree86 :)) if
    a libc5 oldlib is needed by someone.
    (See #206832)
  * Current flex is ok, control changed consequently.

xaw3d (1.5e-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (WOW!)
    (should close: #117325)
  * New upstream, after 5 years of staling.
  * Removed debconf stuff. The past message about new use of Xaw3D was new at
    woody releasing time. Now it's time to remove it, and there is no other
    reason to use debconf.
    (should close: #196439, #144877)
  * Added dpatch support. There was a significant amount of historical patches
    in the debian release: it's time to simplify the management to avoid
    other pain in the ass with future releases.
    Upstream has also integrated almost all of our patches in his current tree,
    so I used dpatch to cross-check the sources.
  * Policy updated at 3.6.0
  * This release could potentially cause some breakage in other packages.
    Surely there is a known problem with xfigi and gv. So, there are good reasons
    to keep it in experimental first of all.

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Aug 2003 15:05:29 +0200

xaw3d (1.5-24) unstable; urgency=low

    See StripChart.c around line 351. This is now coherent with Xaw7.
    (closes: #56421, #59529)

 -- Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>  Wed,  2 Oct 2002 11:40:19 +0200

xaw3d (1.5-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added -DARROW_SCROLLBAR in rules file for EXTRA_DEFINES.
    The trick described in old scrollbars doc is no longer working due 
    to changes in rules file: EXTRA_DEFINES in lib/Xaw3d/Imakefile are ignored.
    That obsolete document has been removed.
    Emacs folks will be happy :)

    This seems also closing an old bug report about scrolling in 
    emacs21 and xterm. Or hope so. I'll see if I could get some better
    patches to have a rock solid correction.

xaw3d (1.3-6.8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload, blessed by the maintainer.
  * Fix porting issues by making xaw3d (the libc5-compat package)
    Architecture: i386 m68k, closes: #17184, #27133, #32244, #53515.
    [important]
  * Used xlib6-altdev tools, too (xmkmf), to make libc5 version depend
    on libc5 X libs (does anyone actually use this libc5-compat lib?!).
    [important]
  * Added Replaces: xaw3dg (<< 1.3-6.4) to xaw3dg-dev, because dpkg would
    barf when upgrading from versions of xaw3dg prior to that one, which
    still contained the static library. [important]

  * Updated for Policy 3.1. Converted to debhelper v2. Lintian clean.
  * Removed Conflicts: and Replaces: xaw3d from xaw3dg, as libc6 version
    does not replace functionality of libc5 version (theoretically that
    doesn't even work).
  * Did strip --strip-debug on the static library (through dh_strip),
    reducing it by more than a half in size.
  * Used upstream Imakefile/Makefile to install things (not for
    libc5-compat, though), actually the only modified variable is $(INCDIR).
    The difference is that three header files are removed - but those were
    most probably extra anyway; and one .c file added - but it seems to be
    on purpose.
  * Made the libc5-compat Imakefile build only the shared library, as we
    don't use the static one, to reduce build time.
  * Made `clean' rule work all the time.
  * Moved xaw3dg-dev to section devel and xaw3d to oldlibs.
  * Moved Suggests: nextawg to xaw3dg package.
  * Upgrade to new xaw-wrappers obsoletes xaw3d(g)'s xaw-wrappers files,
    removed them now. Added Suggests: xaw-wrappers to library packages.
  * Made -dev depend on the exact same version of library package.
    Made -dev package's doc directory a symlink to library package's dir.
  * Removed version from xlib6(g) dependency from the shlibs file... it
    changes constantly in xlib6(g) itself, and dpkg-shlibdeps uses the
    xlib6g's one anyway, so there's no point in using it.
  * Unconditionally fixed lib/Xaw3d/XawI18n.h, to remove need for setting
    -DDEBIAN through make cmdline flags.
  * Changed backup tempfile location in postinsts from /etc to /var/run.
  * Some s/3d/3D/ changes. Renamed debian.README to README.Debian.
    Clarified descriptions in control and in xaw3dg postinst.
