elfutils (0.153-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make it actually build properly using build-arch.  (Closes: #684528)
  * Call rwlock_unlock() before rwlock_fini().  The lock was still held
    causing problems on kfreebsd.  (Closes: #662041)
  * Don't exclude sh_type >= SHT_NUM from stripping, it's set to
    SHT_MIPS_DWARF on mips. (Closes: #662041)
  * readelf -w didn't show the content of debug sections on mips
    because sh_type was set to SHT_MIPS_DWARF.

  * Run autotools at build time.
    - debian/control: Build-Depends: autoconf, automake.
    - debian/rules:
      - config.status:
        - depend on configure.ac, not configure.
        - autoreconf -fis.
      - clean: remove autotools-generated files to avoid .diff.gz
        changes when built twice in a row.
    - debian/patches: remove do-autoreconf.diff.

  [ Marcin Juszkiewicz <marcin.juszkiewicz@linaro.org> ]
  * Convert to multiarch. (Closes: #657139)

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]
  * New upstream release

  * Use dpkg-buildflags.  Build-Depend on dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1~) for
    buildflags.mk.
  * Call configure with --enable-maintainer-mode so all files get regenerated
    Also add Build-Depends on gawk for this to work.
  * Revert %m[ to %a[ change in addr2line and line2addr from the portability
    patch.
  * Clean up more files (Makefile.in, libdw/known-dwarf.h)
  * Set libdir to the multiarch dir, so that the rpath gets set up correctly
    and that we don't have to move the files in the rules file.

elfutils (0.131-1) unstable; urgency=low

elfutils (0.128-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:

    got lost.  (Closes: #404054)
  * First cast main to an intptr_t before casting it to a 64 bit int.
    Directly casting from a pointer to 64 bit int gives a warning
    on 32 bit systems (with gcc-4.2).  (Closes: #431455)
  * Also check for /proc/$$.

elfutils (0.123-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]
  * Add backend support for alpha: adding the registers.
  * Add backend support for arm: adding regs and retval.
    Thanks to Eugeniy Meshcheryakov <eugeniy.meshcheryakov@googlemail.com>
  * Add backend support for hppa, thanks to
    Eugeniy Meshcheryakov <eugeniy.meshcheryakov@googlemail.com>
  * Add some missing ELFOSABI_* and EM_* to elf.h

  [ Christian Aichinger ]
  * Fix sparc backend retval
  * Add mips backend.
  * Rewrite the static backend so making changes to the backends
    is easier.

elfutils (0.122-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]
  * The backends init functions should be functions, not pointers
    to functions.  Also thanks to Eugeniy Meshcheryakov
    for pointing out the same.  This should fix the segmentation faults
    seen on ia64.
  * When doing x && y &, bash retuns the pid for x, while the script
    expected the one for y.  Other shells I've tried return that of y.
    As a result the run-native-test.sh keeps a "native" process running.
    Removed the &&, so it always gets the correct pid.  (Closes: #382758)
  * Fix endiannes problems for opening files of your own endiannes
    when not avoiding unaligned access.  This didn't affect
    i386 and amd64.

  * Fix alignment problems in libdw_alloc seen on sparc.
