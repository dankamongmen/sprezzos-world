Package: exactimage
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: edisplay
Description: fast image manipulation programs
 ExactImage is a fast C++ image processing library. Unlike many other library
 frameworks it allows operation in several color spaces and bit depths
 natively, resulting in low memory and computational requirements.
 .
 This package contains the utilities.
