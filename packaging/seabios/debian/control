Description: Legacy BIOS implementation
 SeaBIOS is a legacy BIOS implementation, aimed at supporting not only
 emulated hosts such as QEMU, but also real hardware.
 .
 Note, however, that SeaBIOS does not handle early initialization of core
 chipsets, so don't even think of flashing it to your board (look at
 Coreboot for that).
