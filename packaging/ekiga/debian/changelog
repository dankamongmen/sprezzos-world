        - Added Kilian to Uploaders list, as he is not in GNOME Team.
        - Added build-depends on automake1.7, intltool and libxml-parser-perl,
          as those are needed for the build process.
        - Bumped Build-Depend on libpt-dev to version 1.6.5-1 as it has fixed
          dependencies.
        - Changed short and long descriptions. We're no more a "Netmeeting clone"
     + debian/menu: Changed longtitle and description.
     + debian/rules:
        - Now install man/gnomemeeting.1 instead of our own manpage.
        - Call dh_gconf to take care of schemas.
     + debian/gnomemeeting.post[inst,rm]: deleted as dh_gconf is now used.
     + debian/gnomemeeting.1: deleted. Upstream included his own manpage.
     + debian/patches:
        - 10_relibtoolize.dpatch: added. Upgrades libtool (#242950)
        - 01_fix_64bit_arch_test.dpatch: deleted. Should be fixed upstream.
        - 00list: run only 10_relibtoolize
	          99_update_libtool_files don't needed with 10_relibtoolize

       downgrade.
     + Cleaned debian/rules to stop configure from running twice.
