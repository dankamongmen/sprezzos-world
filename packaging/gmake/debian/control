Description: utility for directing compilation
 GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables
 and other target files of a program from the program's source
 files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
 solver.

Description: Documentation for the GNU version of the "make" utility.
 This package contains the documentation for GNU Make.  The upstream
 sources for this package are available at the location
 ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/. This package has been stripped down to
 only contain the documentation; since the documentation is covered
 under a non-free license and thus has been moved to
 non-free/doc. Make itself remains in Debian.
