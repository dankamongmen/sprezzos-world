# The script searches indir for unpacked jar files, which must be located in
# ./input_dir/path/to/file.jar!/ dir. It will jar it up to
# ./input_dir/path/to/file.jar, and then remove the contents of unpacked dir.
# After that, it will zip up the contents of indir to xpi file.
# Example: xpi-pack ubufox.out ubufox-ver.xpi
