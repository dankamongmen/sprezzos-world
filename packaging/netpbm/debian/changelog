netpbm-free (1:19940301.2-4) frozen unstable; urgency=high

netpbm (1994.03.01p1-6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer release
  * Fixes for packaging "out of the box" in debian/rules
    (running dpkg-buildpackage should work OK now)

     will be exported)
  * Added ppmcmap.h and ppmdraw.h, because some apps need these headers for
    functions in libppm.a
