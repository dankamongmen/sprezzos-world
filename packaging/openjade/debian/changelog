openjade (1.4devel1-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure it builds with g++ 4.3

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jul 2008 07:46:05 -0400

openjade (1.4devel1-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: COPYING inadvertently was changed to GPL, which applies
    to debian/ dir, not whole package.  Reverted back to COPYING from
    upstream, which appears to be BSD-derived. Does away with cmp that
    caused FTBFS in prior Debian version.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Thu, 31 Aug 2006 21:33:06 -0400

openjade (1.4devel1-17) unstable; urgency=low

openjade (1.4devel1-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed "openjade: FTBFS: bashisms in debian/rules", thanks to Julien
    Danjou (closes: #376481)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Jul 2006 22:20:33 -0400

openjade (1.4devel1-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compiled against new libosp5.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Jan 2006 07:59:04 -0500

openjade (1.4devel1-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh-buildinfo.
  * Updated FSF location in COPYING. (closes: #314414)
  * Update for g++ 4.0 transition - depend on libosp4c2. (closes: #321543)
  * debian/rules: Backed optimization down from -O3 to -O2 to avoid ICE in
    g++ while compiling GroveBuilder.
  * Change "it's" to "its" in Description. (closes: #268534, #277258)

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Aug 2005 21:57:08 -0400

openjade (1.4devel1-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compiled against new libosp4.
  * Moved debhelper compatibility level from debian/rules to debian/compat.
  * Revamped debian/rules - used debhelper to simplify it greatly.
  * Moved include files from openjade package to libostyle-dev package.
    Added Conflicts: openjade (<< 1.4devel1-13) to libostyle-dev.
  * Updated to Standards-Version: 3.6.1 (no changes).
  * Depend on debhelper >= 4.1.75 to pick up bug fixes for dh_installcatalogs.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Oct 2003 22:50:37 -0400

openjade (1.4devel1-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up debian/rules:
  - Set DH_COMPAT=4, debhelper version to (>=4).
  - Used libtool 1.5 for autotools generated files, so C++ gets used for
    linking, ensuring that libs get linked with libstdc++, and removed
    gruesome sed hacks that were necessary to do this with libtool 1.4.
  - Fixed copyright file: was a copy of GPL plus some text that referenced
    /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL, now it is the actual copyright notice,
    the reference, and the Debian copyright info.
  - Let debhelper tools do shlibs and substvars generation instead of
    explicitly doing it in rules.
  - Added openjade-1.4devel1 man page (closes: #191738)
  * Updated to Standards-Version: 3.6.0.
  * Removed libtool from Build-Depends.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Thu,  7 Aug 2003 08:23:59 -0400

openjade (1.4devel1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recognize 'noopt' instead of 'debug' in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Changed section of libostyle-dev to libdevel.
  * Remove use of autotools from regular package build.
  * Added unicode/Makefile.am to replace Debian specific rules.
  * Added contrib/Makefile.am in order to get transform.dsl into openjade
    package.  I find it useful, I suppose others might, too.
  * Added *.gmo to files removed in clean target of makefile in subdir po.
    They get built if not there, and were causing a binary file difference
    error when building the package.
  * Fixed improperly defined 'attribute' function in builtins.dsl; changed
    parameter name from 'string' to 'name'. (closes: #145242)
  * Incorporated patch to fix quoting of '&' in XML backend.  Will push
    upstream. (closes: #147073)
  * Thanks to Toby Speight for the patches that closed the two bugs.

  * Removed unnecessary token pasting operator in Node.cxx so that it
    compiles with g++ 3.3. (closes: #193219)
  * Removed install-docs calls from postinst and prerm; they are already
    handled by dh_installdocs.

 -- Neil Roeth <neil@debian.org>  Sun, 25 May 2003 10:02:51 -0400

 -- Daniel Schepler <schepler@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Mar 2003 04:31:57 -0800

openjade (1.4devel1-8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * Use updated msggen.pl from upstream CVS to allow compilation with
    newer opensp versions.  Closes: #159140.
    (Upstream also changed the soname version with this patch, so I'm
    doing the same.)
  * Remove obsolete po/Makefile code from configure.in.
  * g++-3.2 transition.  Closes: #179709.

 -- Daniel Schepler <schepler@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Mar 2003 18:34:24 -0800

 -- Chad Miller <cmiller@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Feb 2002 16:19:45 +0000

openjade (1.4devel1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made openjade binary use alternatives system.
  * Corrected registration of unicode catalog.  Clobber any other version
    at preinst.

 -- Chad Miller <cmiller@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Dec 2001 02:53:27 +0000

openjade (1.4devel1-6) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Chad Miller <cmiller@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Dec 2001 16:41:00 +0000

openjade (1.4devel1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: fix override disparities in libostyle0 and
    libostyle-dev
  * debian/control: build-depends on gettext
    closes: #105181
  * problem fixed a while ago where we weren't shipping the HTML
    documentation
    closes: #71093
  * Japanese translation added upstream
  * debian/rules: make maintainer-clean upstream is incredibly fragile,
    so tolerate errors there until that gets fixed
  * debian/rules: during build, run libtoolize --force to replace this
    libtoolize stuff, which is needed for arches which diverge from the
    libtool stuff OpenSP ships with
  * debian/rules, control: use dh_shlibdeps, remove some hand-rolled stuff
    here which was unnecessary and in fact adding two libosp deps on the
    opensp package, not to mention that it stopped working

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Jul 2001 11:08:45 -0400

openjade (1.4devel1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * upstream changes from CVS, see NEWS
  * debian/rules: compile with -O3 instead of -O2 to try to get this thing
    faster; CXXFLAGS propogates to the library stuff properly now; remove
    an extra licensing file (thanks, lintian); some improvements in clean
    and cvs-build (snapshot building); run aclocal and autoheader, I think
    this is proper -- it certainly inhibits some warnings
  * debian/control: update standards to 3.5.0 (no changes required)

 -- Adam Di Carlo <aph@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Feb 2001 21:44:24 -0500
