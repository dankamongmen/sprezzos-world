  * Security: path disclosure via suidperl [CAN-2003-0618] fixed by
    application of upstream change 21045 (thanks Jarkko; closes:
    #203426).

  * Add dependency on the exact version of perl-base to libperl5.8 to
    ensure that the correct base modules are available to programs
    embedding an interpreter (closes: 182089).

    Move shared library to the perl-base package on architectures
    where /usr/bin/perl is dynamically linked to the library
    (everything other than i386) to avoid a dependency loop.

  * Change sections to match overrides (new perl and libdevel sections).
  * Apply upstream change 18471 to correct behaviour of tell on files
    opened O_APPEND (reported by Sergio Rua).

  * Apply upstream change 21031 to alter the distribution conditions
    of perlreftut(1) (see #202723).  Include this manual page in
    perl-doc once again.  Many thanks to Kevin Carlson of TPJ and to
    Mark Jason Dominus for their cooperation and assistance with this
    licence change.

  * Apply patch from Matt Kraai making braced-group macro expressions
    conditional on !__cplusplus (fixes abiword build on m68k; closes:
    #204859).

  * Ensure all dependencies of libperl are directly linked (previously
    -lm and -lpthread were not) for prelink (closes: #187372).

  * Fix permissions on DEBIAN directories in build (closes: #207332).
  * Expand perl-modules description (closes: #210096).
  * Add some documentation to README.Debian about the source package.
  * Backport some changes from DB_File 1.806 to set some tie argument
    defaults (reported by Sergio Rua).

  * Apply upstream fix for h2ph from Kurt Starsinic to suppress
    redefinition warnings.

perl (5.8.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * NOTE: this release breaks binary compatability with previous
    versions of perl.  Users will need to upgrade to newer versions of
    binary module packages (if/when available) and re-build any
    locally installed modules.

  * NOTE: DB_File now uses libdb4.0 (previously libdb2).  Any DB_File
    databases created with earlier perl packages will need to be
    upgraded before being used with the current module with the
    db4.0_upgrade program (in the libdb4.0-util package, with HTML docs
    in db4.0-doc).

  * NOTE: suidperl is now deprecated upstream and support is expected
    to be discontinued for 5.10.  Package description amended.

  * Add Conflicts/Replaces/Provides for modules now included in core:
      libdigest-md5-perl, libmime-base64-perl, libnet-perl,
      libtime-hires-perl, libstorable-perl,
      libattribute-handlers-perl, libcgi-perl, libi18n-langtags-perl,
      liblocale-maketext-perl, libmath-bigint-perl, libnet-ping-perl,
      libtest-harness-perl, libtest-simple-perl

  * Update versions of conflicts on libpod-parser-perl,
    libansicolor-perl and libfile-temp-perl.

  * Add conflict for autoconf2.13 pre 2.13-45 which breaks with this
    perl (closes: #155064).

  * Enable threads (closes: #107909, #126233).
  * Add -f (--force) option to /usr/bin/rename (closes: #140746).
  * Add -n (--no-act) option to /usr/bin/rename (suggested by
    frederik@ugcs.caltech.edu).

  * Correct rename(1) manual page (closes: #153458, #153757).
  * Prepend /etc/perl to @INC to provide a standard location for
    configuration modules:
      /etc/perl/Net/Config.pm (note: previously /etc/Net in libnet-perl)
      /etc/perl/CPAN/Config.pm (closes: #138167, #103055).

  * Add an option for CPAN.pm to skip version check (closes: #98235).
  * Include /usr/bin/cpan script (closes: #136159).
  * Modify perldoc to format pages simarly to man-db when stdout is a
    terminal (closes: #135318).

    Debian systems the libperl-dev package is required (closes: #155319).

  * Allow accept to return addresses > sockaddr_in (closes: #156284).
  * Modify debian/rules to remove libperl.so* on failure (closes: #157953).
  * This version appears to correct the following bugs:

  * Choose one libreadline-*-perl package to suggest, as having both
    with an | was tickling an obscure bug in apt-get.

  * Patch perldoc to warn rather than die on non-existent dirs in @INC

perl-5.6 (5.6.0-6.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * Moving the libperl.so symlink to libperl5.6 requires conflicts and
    replaces.  (Closes: #80794).

perl-5.6 (5.6.0-6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * Ensure that a valid /usr/bin/perl exists before each instance of
    "update-alternatives --remove" in perl-5.6-base.postinst, as any
    of these may possibly blow away the symlink.  (Closes: #76432).

  * If an alternative existed for perl.1p.gz before installation, the
    file of that name in this package was removed in the postinst
    update-alternatives.  The same goes for cperl-mode.el.  Install
    versioned files and manually link like the rest of the
    alternatives mess.  (Closes:  #78742, #79728).

    Note that both of these changes to alternative handling are merely
    stop-gap measures.  The situation still remains that installing
    perl-5.004 or 5.005 after 5.6 has been installed will play merry
    havoc with the symlinks again and stands a good chance of nuking
    /usr/bin/perl if subsequently removed.

  * make.versions:  rename rather than copying files so that we don't
    ship two copies of each binary in the .deb (linked to canonical
    name in postinst).

  * Move warnings::register to -base.  (Closes: #79075, #79234).
  * Move autosplit.ix for File::Glob to -base.  (Closes: #77384)
  * Move load_imports.al for POSIX to -base.
  * Move IO.pm to -base.
  * Move dangling libperl.so symlink to libperl5.6.

    Remove references to syslog.ph - 07_syslog_path_log.
  * The debug target now uses ./Configure -deS to make it not look for a
    tty. (closes: #77009)
  * Fix make.base so it works for the newer version number. (closes: #47204)
  * Add base.pm to perl-5.\d+-base for debconf (closes: #77145)
  * Add XSLoader.pm to perl-5.\d+-base.  Many module authors thought Dynaloader
    took to much memory; XSLoader is a much smaller version.
    (closes: #77280, #77292)
  * Add File::Glob to perl-5.\d+-base so those scripts using globbing work under
    5.6.  (closes: #77384)
  * Add libdb2-dev to the Build-Depends list.  (closes: #77758)
  * Downgrade perl-5.\d+-suid to optional.  (closes: #77841)
  * Only mention the problem with updating to the new Berkeley DB format
    if upgrading.  (closes: #76425)
  * 5.6.0-3 fixed the include paths already.  (closes #76421)
  * Change the documentation of AutoLoader to not suggest testing against
    the text of an error message.
    Change those places in Perl where an AUTOLOAD method does so.

    when -1 was installed.) closes: #76425)
  * Make tests not run on big endian mips (from "Florian Lohoff"

  * Net::Ping makes invalid assumptions about UDP always returning a
    hostname if there is any data on the socket - 06_netping_udp_fix.

  * Mention that perl-[.\d]+-doc overwrites parts of libansicolor-perl and
    libpod-parser-perl.  (closes: #76443)
  * Note that I'll release the no-alternatives version of all three Perl
    packages 2 days after this version is accepted so as to give it time

  * Fix t/op/filetest.t so that it works under fakeroot -
    debian/patches/03_fix_fakeroot_op_filetest
  * Make the patched target append each patch as it goes to the 'patched'
    file.  Make the target .precious to keep make from removing it on
    error.  That would rather defeat the point.
  * rm config.sh.static in clean target
  * Shorten the make targets for building the static Perl:
    - Now, build target builds both the static Perl and the libperl with
      extensions and such.
    - Only Perl and suid Perl get built.  We don't need to build the
      extensions when we're about to blow them away.
    - We also wait performing the tests until we have the shared Perl.
  * Actually get the paths correct for Perl, using a colon separated
    privlib and archlib.
    This uncovered 2 documentation and 1 Configure bug in Perl.
  * Make NDBM_File use libgdbm's ndbm emulation instead of libdb's since
    DB_File can't handle null keys currently. -
    debian/patches/04_NDBM_uses_libgdbm
  * Perl 5.6 has to conflict with the old data-dumper package.  Since the
    package isn't available anymore in potato or woody, this shouldn't be
    a problem.
  * incpush will create duplicate path entries in @INC if either
    vendorlibexp or sitelibexp don't end in the version number of Perl.

perl-5.005 (5.005.03-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This needs to be put into frozen so that Alpha has the correct
    syscall.ph constants (important bug #55794) and the copyright on the
    perl-policy is correct (important bug #60233)
  * Changed copyright on perl-policy.sgml from "the Debian Project" to
    "Software in the Public Interest".  This is so the document is
    actually copyrighted by a legal entity.  This closes: bug#60233.
  * Completely regenerated the *.ph files.  There appears to be a clean
    separation these days of system specific stuff into the asm
    directories.  The only question would be the stuff in the bits/
    directory since that seems to be autogenerated by the kernel.
    The only one that I know needs it is bits/syscall.ph.  I've written a
    script to make sure it takes in all the syscalls as necessary.
    Note that this is a somewhat long job since h2ph only does a 90% job,
    so the generated .ph files take a bit of hand-editing.  This closes:
    bug#55794.
  * Install the Perl Social Contract (Porting/Contract) into the doc
    directory of the perl-5\d+-doc package.  This closes #51963.
  * Modified lib/ExtUtils/MM_Unix.pm so that if the environment variable
    NO_LD_RUN_PATH is set true, then MakeMaker won't use LD_RUN_PATH in
    the dynamic_lib method and therefore the .so won't have an rpath built
    into them.  This closes: bug#47116.

perl-5.005 (5.005.03-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Many changes to make Perl build on Hurd from Marcus Brinkman, closes:
    Bug#31621.
    - Update debian/README to partially reflect the current situation; no
      need to type root password; the problem with locales was fixed long ago.
    - Update debian/copyright to talk about Debian rather than Debian/GNU;
      There are now many O'Reilly books on Perl.  Don't mention a number.
    - Convince debian/make.base and debian/make.versions to use
      $cpu-$system rather than $arch.
    - Use linux and gnu as acceptable systems in debian/make.base
    - Don't try to mkdir with '/' on the end of the name in debian/make.base
    - Skip packages we don't build in debian/make.versions
    - Change all maintainer scripts to use =cpu=-=system= rather than
      =arch=
    - Many changes to debian/rules to allow for conditional testing (not
      on arm, hurd) and conditional building of threads (not on hurd,
      5.004)
      I think this is the last thing (other than debian/control) that is
      different between the builds.  I'll parameterize debian/control on
      the next build and we'll be happy.
  * Change the paths in debian/rules and debian/perl-policy.MK to be FHS
    compliant.
  * Make the postinsts/prerms install/remove the compatibility symlink for
    the move from FSSTD to FHS.
  * Fix debian/make.versions to be FHS compliant as well.
  * Use -fPIC in the cccdlflags so that Perl compiles with -fPIC everwhere
    instead of -fpic in some places.  This now complies with policy and
    closes: Bug#41587, #43930.
  * Have make test actually use make test-notty so as to not die on
    automated compiles.  Closes: Bug#33225.
  * Use unlink instead of system("rm -f ...") in debian/make.base.  I seem
    to've gotten carried away using cp -a a while back and used system
    instead of unlink. Brain needs to be on...
  * Change the mention of the location of the GPL and Artistic copyright
    files in debian/copyright from /usr/doc/copyright to
    /usr/share/common-licenses.
  * Fix Getopt::Long so that the documentation of the require_order
    configuration option is now correct closes: Bug#39180.
  * Embedding works now.  It's probably as Tom Rothamel
    <tom-pine-1@onegeek.org> said; Perl just needed to be recompiled with
    glibc2.1.  Closes: Bug#38615.
  * In gv.c, Fix for 'use Safe;' with -w segfaults from Sarathy installed.
    Closes: Bug#38533.
  * In handy.h, only #define HAS_BOOL due to _G_HAVE_BOOL if we're using
    g++.  _G_HAVE_BOOL is defined in _G_config.h.  This will probably be
    included in a gcc program since stdio.h includes libio.h which
    includes _G_config.h.  Thanks to Greg Stark <gsstark@mit.edu>.  This
    can be closed once it is tested.
  * Namespace was cleaned up a while ago, closes: bug#33844.
  * Complaining locales was fixed a while ago, closes: bug#30207.
  * Perl has been compiled with glibc for a while, closes: bug#29452.
  * rename has been included, closes: bug#26616.
  * cperl-mode is installed in the right place now, closes: bug#24249.
  * Specify man1dir in Configure so that it goes to the FHS compliant
    place.
  * Fix the paths for $(LIBDIR)/ExtUtils/inst $(LIBDIR)/ExtUtils/xsubpp
    $(LIBDIR)/File/DosGlob.pm to make lintian happy.
  * Make $(LIBDIR)/ExtUtils/inst $(LIBDIR)/ExtUtils/xsubpp executable to
    make lintian happy.
  * Remove $(LIBDIR)/CGI/Fast.pm since we don't include FCGI.pm.  This
    satisfies lintian and closes: bug#44544.
  * Applied patch from Jim Pick <jimpick@jimpick.com> that adds the
    appropriate arch-specific *.ph files in debian/.ph/asm-arm.  This
    would close bug#44605 but it's requiring some *.ph files he doesn't
    supply.  Mail sent off to him about this.  Got
    .ph/arm-arch/proc/shmparam.ph from him.  Closes: bug#44605.
  * Add Porting/patchls to /usr/bin, fix its path.
  * install-doc should show be used in both remove && upgrade for prerm.
    Add stuff to debian/doc.postinst to deal with this problem.
  * Added re.pm and friends to perl-5.\d+-base.  This closes: bug#45552.
  * Removed the large number of extra POSIX autoloader modules.  The
    locale stuff that's part of POSIX don't need these.
  * I've already moved to /usr/share/man in this package and so, this
    closes: bug#45678.

    (thanks to Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>)
  * New version of perl-policy from Raphael.
  * Fix Config.pm's startperl to be /usr/bin/perl (or
    /usr/bin/perl-thread) when the build is done.
  * Fix the installman[13]dir's in Config.pm so a simple perl Makefile.PL;

  * No longer conflict with data-dumper so that it can remain installed

  * No longer ask if we should abort during the preinst.  Perl 5.004 isn't
    diabled with the installation of Perl 5.005, so there is no reason.

    perl-thread.  This way when another Thread::*.3pm comes along, I don't
    have to notice, it will.
  * Add/Remove /usr/local/lib/site_perl/$arch-linux-thread in
    thread.postinst/prerm if /usr/local/lib is writable.
  * Fixed missing parens around $version when moving perl.1p back to perl
    from perl-doc
  * Mentioned installing 5.004_05 in copyright file as well as correcting
    the path to CPAN on www.perl.com.
  * Add Debian changelog to perl-base.
  * Remaining typo fixes from Raphael:
    /usr/man/man1/perl-=version=.1p.gz in postinst
    startperl should be #!/usr/bin/perl-$(version)
    the asm *.ph directories should be =version=/=arch=-version
  * perl-$(version)-base should conflict with perl-base rather than perl.
    This way, if someone has never installed the full Perl package, they
    still conflict until all the non-versioned Perl is gone.
  * rename threadperl-5.005 to perl-5.005-thread.  Raphael is right;
    tab-completion is handy.

perl-5.005 (5.005.03-0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Integrated Raphael's changes without the debhelper stuff.
  * Made cperl-mode.el be version specific with alternatives.
  * Raphael updated the Standards-Version in control to 2.5.0.
  * Raphael fixed up the base.postinst so that the newly installed
    (not-yet-versioned) perl runs update-alternatives.
  * Made perl-version-doc Recommend perl-version instead of just Suggest
    it.  perl-doc should only not be installed in special cases.
  * Made perl-version-thread Priority: extra instead of optional.
    Considering the experimental nature of threaded Perl right now, I'd
    say it qualifies having specialized requirements.
  * Applied the same changes to the i386-linux-thread tree as I did to the
    i386-linux tree.  Don't want my paths leaking into Config.pm.

perl-5.005 (5.005.03-0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed io reference.
  * Corrected perl-5.005-thread postinst/versionning/building.
  * Added replaces data-dumper to perl-5.005-doc so that
    the Data::Dumper man page may be overwritten without
    forcing.

perl-5.005 (5.005.03-0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Converted to debhelper.
  * Added POSIX stuff into perl-5.005-base.
  * Corrected many lintian warnings/errors
  * WARNING: NDBM_File and DB_File built with libdb2 - this is
    incompatible with old db files.

perl-5.005 (5.005.03-0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Major changes to the debian files as we go to versioned Perls.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Sat,  5 Jun 1999 00:08:42 -0700

perl (5.005.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Note that this is a very basic release so that
    module authors can release their stuff under 5.005.  (Fixes Bug
    #26072)
  * Defined d_statblks in Configure (Fixes Bug #22367)
  * Conflict, replace, and provide data-dumper since it's now provided by
    Perl.  (Fixes Bug #27543)
  * Specifically turn off sfio for the standard release of Perl.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Sat,  9 Jan 1999 16:43:23 -0800

perl (5.004.04-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix symlinks for perl-suid and perl-debug doc directories.  (Fixes Bug
    #19867)
  * Make sure that *all* files are readable.  (Fixes Bug #20791)
  * Make changes to c2ph.PL (includes pstruct), perldoc, and s2p so that
    they try to use POSIX::tmpnam() in creating temp files.  Note that
    perlbug already checks for the existence of the temp file before
    creating it.  (Fixes Bug #19805)
  * Apply patch from next maintenance release so that -e scripts are kept
    in memory rather than written to a temporary file.
  * Fix typo in perlop(1p).  Thanks to Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>
    for pointing this out.  (Fixes Bug #22488)
  * Add /usr/doc/perl/perlfaq-is-free to explain Tom Christiansen's intent
    with his perlfaq copyright.  (Closes Bugs #10286, #22705)
  * Fix typos in postrm scripts.  Thanks to Mark Eichin <eichin@arepa.com>
    for this.  (Fixes Bug #23107)

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Tue,  2 Jun 1998 04:42:47 -0700

perl (5.004.04-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add copyright file to perl-base since it makes it comply with the
    standards and doesn't take up much space.  (Fixes Bug #19384)
  * Added files to base so that dpkg-ftp is fully supported.  (Actually in
    -4, but I forgot to mention it.)  (Fixes Bug #16134)
  * Added even more files to base so that libnet is fully supported.
    (Fixes Bug #18338, #18593)
  * Remove /usr/lib/perl5/DynaLoader.pm - yet another file left over from
    disk install. (Fixes Bug #17970, #18823)
  * Specify -DSTRUCT_TM_HASZONE to keep POSIX from dumping core.  (Fixes
    Bug #17393)
  * debugperl and suidperl now have manpages that are symbolic links to
    perl(1p).  I debated linking debugperl(1p) to perlrun(1p) and
    suidperl(1p) to perlsec(1p) but didn't think that was appropriate.
    (Fixes Bugs #6295, #6330, #9847, #9995, #10102).
  * Changed description of perldebug to say that it shows internals of
    Perl and helps debug Perl.  (Fixes Bug #17547).
  * Changed the permissions on suidperl to give group and world read
    access.  It makes no sense to restrict read access when anyone can get
    a copy of off CPAN.
  * Also registered suidperl with suidmanager.  (Fixes Bug #15702)
  * Remove the execute permission and use strip --strip-unneeded on all
    the .so's.  (Fixes #5100, #5124, #6328, #6903)
  * Sym-Link find2perl.1p.gz and pod2latex.1p.gz to undocumented.7.gz until
    I can write something or it's provided.  Sym-Link pod2text.1p.gz to
    Pod::Text.3pm.gz.  (Fixes #6328)
  * Sym-link /usr/doc/perl/changelog to /usr/doc/perl/Changes so that the
    latest upstream changes file has the proper name.
  * Tell perl_archive in ExtUtils::MM_Unix to return -lc so that the
    shared libraries built with MakeMaker have libc dependency information
    embedded in them.  Note that if the module specifies it's own
    libraries, those will come after the -lc.  If this is a problem, the
    module should specify -lc in its library list.
  * Use mkstemp to avoid security/dos race conditions in /tmp.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Tue, 10 Mar 1998 23:00:09 -0800

perl (5.004.04-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add || true to the fixup lines in the perl.postinst - the previous
    method didn't expose the error return of rmdir -p, the if;then;fi
    method does.  (Fixes Bugs #15854, #16412, #17328, #17425)
  * Adapted patch from Stephen Zander <srz@mckesson.com> so that Perl
    knows to use getspnam if shadowing is enabled.  (Needed extra
    Configure bits added.) (Fixes Bug #15993)
  * Added Conflicts: perl (<<5.004.04-2) to perl-base so you can't install
    it with an older version of the perl package.  (Fixes Bug #16810)
  * Make sure that none of the gzipped examples are executable in
    /usr/doc/perl/examples.  (Fixes Bug #11978)
  * Remove /usr/lib/perl5/IO/Handle.pm.  It was left over from a disk
    install where parts of Perl weren't handled by dpkg.  Its presence is
    causing version mis-matches.  (Fixes Bug #15572)

perl (5.004.04-3) unstable; urgency=medium (High for those upgrading from bo)

  * A start on building a libperl5.so.\d+.  I'm going to put this into
    since 1) Perl is linking with a static libperl.a and 2) people may
    want to install libperl5.so.\d+ without installing perl.
  * Oops.  I hadn't considered the chance that the old perl package would
    be replaced by the new perl package (without Perl) before perl.base
    was configured.  Added a pre-depends of perl-base (>=5.004.04-2) to
    make sure that Perl is always installed on an upgrade.
  * The first 90% of a project takes 90% of the time.  The remaining 10%
    of the time takes the other 90%.  Building a libperl ran into some
    interesting snags and will not debut with this version.
  * Adapted patch by Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au> that uses
    if's in the postinst so that we don't get false negatives on
    install.  Took the chance to change the find/xargs to use -print0/-0
    jic.

perl (5.004.04-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Wonderful idea from Scott Ellis <storm@stormcrow.ml.org>, set archlib
    to be the major version so that maintenance versions don't break all
    the arch-dependent perl-debian packages.
  * Strip a2p, fixing Bug #14891.
  * Files copied by make.base should keep hard-links.

perl (5.004.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream (maintenance) version
  * Turn off Perl 5.003 compatibility since this is the libc6
    version. (should've been done last version)
  * All tests finally pass now that locale test #102 was considered not
    important for Perl.
  * First attempt to get perl-base -really- working.  (As opposed to what
    I did in 5.003.07).

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Tue, 21 Oct 1997 02:20:05 -0700

perl (5.004.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream (maintenance) version
  * Recompiled for libc6.
  * Remove ftp.pl from the distribution since it depends on chat2.pl which
    is obsolete and has been removed from the perl dist at the request of
    its author.
  * Remove the -I/usr/include/db since that was only for libc5.

perl (5.004-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had a semi-colon in the wrong place such that the gzip of the
    man-pages (which are now compressed) killed off the removal of the
    build artifacts in Config.pm.  Enough still ran so as to not be overly
    noticeable.  Registering bug against gzip since it should be possible
    to not have an error if you try to compress already compressed files.

perl (5.003.07-8) unstable; urgency=low

    Somehow a static version of postinst crept into the dist such that it
    depended on 5.00320 and i386.  *embarrased*

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Sat, 8 Mar 1997 14:06:21 -0800

perl (5.003.07-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compile the perl library with -D_REENTRANT for LinuxThreads.  It's
    still dangerous and there are problems with MULTIPLICITY (which this
    isn't compiled with) as well.
  * Sent the output of the various rmdir -p's in postinst to /dev/null so
    that people don't see old gunk.
  * Included target to add a comment to the changelog so that an automatic
    package from untarring this in a new perl subversion works with the
    correct version.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Mon, 3 Mar 1997 01:35:20 -0800

perl (5.003.07-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed perl, perl-suid, and perl-debug to section interpreters.
    Changed perl-base to section base.
  * Changed rules to determine the perl version dynamically so that it
    doesn't have to be editted for each new version.
  * Rebuld and upload so that perl will just pre-depend on libc5.4 rather
    than libc5.4.17-1.  This and -5 were destined for stable and 5.4.17-1
    isn't available for that.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Fri, 17 Jan 1997 19:04:13 -0800

perl (5.003.07-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved config.over.MK to the debian directory so that all the files
    that I add are there.
  * Just ignore the mkdir on /usr/local as the easiest solution to the
    NFS-ro /usr/local problem.  Suggestion by Guy Maor <maor@ece.utexas.edu>.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Fri, 10 Jan 1997 02:13:22 -0800

perl (5.003.07-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add check to postinst to check for old perlconfig created include
    directories and removed them.
  * Made perlbase's Config.pm use the correct install paths
  * Made perl provide/replace/conflict with perlbase to replace it
    properly
  * No longer put libperl.a in suidperl since we not doing shared perl.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Thu, 12 Dec 1996 23:40:09 -0800

perl (5.003.07-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed Perl to provide io as well as conflict with it since it's been
    subsumed into the main perl distribution.
  * Applied patch from Nick to make use FileHandle; work transparently
    although is should be use IO::Handle (or other appropriate IO::)
  * Applied patch from Randy so that use sigtrap doesn't complain anymore.
  * Applied patch from Paul that changes use strict tie; into a warning.
  * Changed perl back to a static libperl
  * Developed and packaged a perl-base to go on the base-floppies.

 -- Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>  Thu, 21 Nov 1996 04:13:51 -0800

perl (5.003.07-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * added code to postinst/prerm that only creates the empty
    /usr/local/lib/site_perl directory if /usr/local/lib is writable by
    root (fixes Bug #5003)
  * Updated to dpkg standards version 2.1.1.0  (fixes Bugs #3874, 4709)
  * Pre-generated all the *.ph files that people will probably need.  The
    correct asm directory will have a symbolic link set during postinst.
    (fixes Bugs #4493, 4739, 1856, 3770, 3277, 3803, 3814, 1099, 3784,
     1201, 1170, 3908, 2405, 4717, 2184, 1411, 2440)
    I wonder if this is a record for the most number of bugs fixed by a
    change.
  * Changed debian.rules to generate a shared libperl for the main
    executable with a static suidperl and debugperl.  This should help
    Fast-CGI, nvi, and if folks are using the compiler.
  * Edited the copyright file to reflect current reality rather than
    bygone days (fixes Bug #2589)
  * Added Pre-depends: ldso to control file in case the user upgrades ldso
    at the same time they upgrade Perl. (fixes Bug #2589)
  * Made sure that all files in the examples directory
    (/usr/doc/perl/examples) were readable (fixes Bug #3995, 4615, 4734,
    4870)
  * Added symbolic link /usr/doc/perl/examples to point to the examples
    directory. (fixes Bug #3997)  (this is obsoleted by new standards)

	* Changed Depends: libc5, libdb1, libgdbm1 to Pre-Depends
	* Added check for pre-depends support into preinst
	* Added a link to ../usr/bin/perl from /bin/perl
	* Had Configure undef CSH so that we don't need to depend on csh
	  anymore.

Perl 5.003 Debian 1 Tue Jun 25 02:25:00 1996  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

Perl 5.002 Debian 10 Thu Jun  6 01:05:36 1996  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* The permissions of many of the files were set right.  Fix in

Perl 5.002 Debian 9 Tue Jun  4 02:00:00 1996  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Changed recommends of perl from source | includes to libc5-dev
	  in accord with where the include files actually come from
	* Added the following Priority fields: Perl - Important (from
	  Packages), perl-suid - Standard, perl-debug - Optional
	* use dpkg-name instead of a manual move

Perl 5.002 Debian 9 Wed May  1 00:13:32 1996  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	  remove the tcsh once c-shell is provided by it.
	* Changed the suidperl from being a question in the postinst to
	  being it's own package.
	* Added perld (debugging perl) as a package.  Both of these are
	  dependent on the specific version of perl.  We'll see if this
	  causes a problem in upgrading.
	* Changed mail address in postinst to debian-bugs@pixar.com.  I've
	  got to do something about perlconfig

Perl 5.002 Debian 8 Wed Apr 17 02:48:46 1996  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Changed the tcsh dependency to c-shell.
	* Added the dosuid define to Configure so that perl would once
	  again create a suidperl.  It was dropped from the upstream
	  release.  There is a question in the postinst that asks if you
	  want it or not.

Perl 5.002 Debian 8 Mon Mar 11 23:01:27 1996  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Added dependency on tcsh until the globbing works without

Perl 5.002 Debian 4 Sun Jan  7 02:47:14 1996  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Upgraded to the upstream version of perl5.002beta1h from Andy
	* Removed the a.out generation from debian.rules since I'm not
	  making a.out packages anymore
	* Changed pod/Makefile from PERL = perl to PERL = ../miniperl so
	  that a build will work if you don't have perl installed already
	* Changed installperl to not try to guess about links if you
	  installing to a different directory than you will be running
	  from (debian-tmp/usr/bin)

Perl 5.002 Debian 4 Fri Dec 29 23:57:14 1995  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Added a check to see if /usr/local/include is there before
	  attempting to build .ph files from the .h files there (Bug #1856)

Perl 5.002 Debian 4 Fri Dec 22 01:39:08 1995  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Added the patch 5.002b1g from Tom - a documentation only patch

Perl 5.002 Debian 3 Tue Dec 19 01:47:19 1995  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Perl now uses the new sonames for libgdbm and libdb with
	  dependencies on the new names (libdb1 and libgdbm1)
	
Perl 5.002 Debian 3 Mon Dec 18 03:23:04 1995  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Summary of additions:
	  Added patches a-f from Andy
	  Applied the patch to implement Safe perl that will be coming out
	  soon.
	  Applied some documentation patches - perldata/dsc/mod/ref by
	  TomC, perlembed by JonO, tiehash by RandyR, and perlxs by DeanR
	* Had to cruft up the Configure script so that it does an nm on
	  static libs and an nm -D on shared libs.  I thought just nm
	  should work on both.

Perl 5.002 Debian 2 Mon Nov 27 02:34:59 1995  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Removed find lines in debian.rules binary install since
	  installperl does a good job of it
	* Removed find lines in postinst/perlconfig since the include file
	  permissions and modes should be fine.
	* moved /usr/doc/perl/example_code to /usr/doc/examples/perl
	* Changed reference in example README to 'eg' directory to
	  examples directory
	* Changed some bad paths in example code directory
	* Had install check and not ask about installing in odd places if
	  debian-tmp is in the install-path

Perl 5.002 Debian 1 Sat Nov 25 01:05:15 1995  Darren Stalder  <torin@daft.com>

	* Removed manual generation of manpages in debian.rules file.  Now
	  just call ./installman with the appropriate arguments.
	* Changed extensions for man1 pages to 1p and man3 pages to 3pm
	* Changed Configure so that it actually listens when you tell it
	  what extensions to use for for man1 and man3.
	* Changed references to /usr/local and perl5.000 in the man pages
	* Changed references in scripts from /usr/local to /usr
	* Setup config.over file to fix-up config.sh to install into
	  debian-tmp/usr/* instead of trying to do it in sh.  The shared
	  libs weren't going in the right place.
	* Generated absolute path in config.over since the install runs
	  from many different subdirectoris

Perl 5.002 Debian 1 Wed Nov 22 20:42:34 1995  Darren Stalder <torin@daft.com>
	* Applied some doc changes to perlre.pod

	  specific *.ph directories
	* Added dependencies on libgdbm and libdb, giving support for
	  those databases.
	* Removed gdbm capability from aout version.  User can add it if
	  necessary without recompiling perl.
	* SDBM problem went away with patchlevel 2.

	* Put quotes around $Config{archlibexp} in h2ph.PL to prevent -w
	  warnings.
	* Changed the various debian files to reflect the new status.
	* Changed the debian.rules to use elf as the primary development
	  platform with a.out being secondary.
	* Having problems with SDBM.

* Longer Description field in control file.
* Changed Maintainer field to myself. This package should still be considered
  orphaned though.

* Updated to 5.001n: big patch, small problems remain.
* debian.rules now passes definitions to Configure, instead of running
  Configure with a modified hints/linux.sh.
* Use a variable in debian.rules to test the binary format.
* With ELF, DB_File support is disabled (rather ad hoc).
* Use softlinks for suidperl and perl<version>.
* Added explicit Depends: elf-libc, which was implicit (via elf-libgdbm).

* ELF version has GDBM support; depends on elf-libgdbm

* Fixed Bug#219.  h2ph was making output which didn't work.
* put magic in the postinst to fix it.  This opens the can
* of worms whereby I fix all of h2ph's messups.  Ugh.

Perl 5.001 Debian 2 - 5/8/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
* Added dialog.pl interface to dialog for Jim Robinson

Perl 5.001 Debian 1 - 3/1/95 Carl Streeter <streeter@cae.wisc.edu>
