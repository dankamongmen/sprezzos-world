Bug #413102: Avoid accidentally becoming an ssh ControlMaster.

If you set ControlMaster via your ssh config:
.ssh/config:
Host *
    ControlMaster auto
    Controlpath ~/.ssh/master-%r@%h:%p

you can get 'svn: Can't write to connection: Broken pipe' with certain
ssh commands, because svn can open multiple ssh sessions and kill them
at unpredictable times.

I don't really think the problem is either svn's or openssh's fault,
but this is the obvious way to avoid it.  We will still use ssh
connection sharing, but only if a ControlMaster is already present.
