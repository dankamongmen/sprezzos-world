   - Dynamic Playlists - create playlists that automatically update.
   - Context View - customize interface with the Plasma powered Context View.
   - PopUp Dropper - simplify drag&drop actions with revolutionary menu system.
   - Multiple Language Translations
   - Collection Management - organizing your music collection has never been
     easier with Amarok's powerful tagging, renaming, and sorting abilities.
