  * pkgstripfiles, symlink_doc(): Don't create symlinks that would point to
    the same package. (LP: #923343)

  * pkgstripfiles: Always update md5sum even if advpng fails. Also call advpng
    if optipng fails, to at least get some optimization. Thanks Felix Geyer!

  * test/run, test_doc_symlink(): Simplify installation of "Makefile".
  * test/run, test_doc_symlink(): Introduce some test library binary packages
    to check handling of transitive dependencies.
  * pkgstripfiles, symlink_doc(): If the link destination target is itself a
    link, resolve it to directly link to the final target instead of not
    symlinking the file at all.
  * test/run: Add new test cases test_doc_symlink_parallel_{fixed,unlimited}()
    which run the symlink test with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS "parallel=4" and
    "parallel" respectively. Run through them three times as this is a race
    condition and does not trigger every time. This reproduces LP #893826.
  * Add dh_builddeb: Wrapper around the debhelper command which filters out
    the "parallel" option from $DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. We must not run dpkg-deb in
    parallel as this breaks a predictable doc symlink structure which we
    require for multi-arch. (LP: #893826)
  * debian/pkgbinarymangler.install: Install dh_builddeb wrapper.
  * debian/pkgbinarymangler.{preinst,postrm}: Set up diversion for

  * Move code for determining the location of the binary package control file,
    and its existence check into common, and simplify pkgmaintainermangler,
    pkgsanitychecks, and pkgstripfiles.
  * pkgstriptranslations: Stop iterating over all binary packages, just
    process the current one. Update an existing translation tarball if it
    already exists from a previous run. This greatly speeds up package builds
    with lots of binary packages. (LP: #890595) Also reorganize the code to
    put the different tasks into separate functions, so that it becomes
    easier to read. Drop the now obsolete stripping of XPI files.
  * With this version, haskell-dummy builds in finite time and succeeds.

  * pkgstriptranslations: Also strip X-GNOME-Keywords. Add corresponding test
    case.
  * dh_translations: Also check configure.ac for GETTEXT_DOMAIN. (LP: #786632)
  * pkgstripfiles: First symlink identical doc files, then truncate Debian
    changelogs. Otherwise truncated changelogs will never be identical due to
    the added "please see apt-get changelog <pkgname>" line. In oneiric and
    before this got hidden because of a wrong exit code of zcmp, which has
    been fixed in gzip 1.4 in precise.
  * pkgstripfiles: As we truncate long Debian changelogs, and a packages'
    dependencies may not have been processed by pkgstripfiles yet, Debian
    changelogs are sometimes different at the tail. Debian changelogs are
    generally identical between binary packages anyway, but as there is the
    theoretical possibility of having a binary package specific one, do a
    comparison still, but only the topmost 20 lines.

pkgbinarymangler (100) oneiric; urgency=low

  * test/run: Add forgotten check_deb_integrity() to documentation symlink
    tests. This catches the wrong md5sums of symlinked doc files.
  * pkgstripfiles: Remove doc files from md5sums which get replaced with a
    symlink. (LP: #795845)
  * test/run: Call check_deb_integrity() in build(), and remove the explicit
    call from all the individual tests. There is no situation where we expect
    broken debs to be created, so this saves us from accidentally forgetting
    to call it in newly created tests.
  * test/run: Drop separate check_translation_tarball() test, and integrate it
    into check_deb_mo(). We now want to move to only building translation
    tarballs for packages which we actually strip, so it does not make sense
    any more to check those two individually.
  * pkgstriptranslations: Do not build a translation tarball if we did not
    strip the packages. With that, Launchpad does not need to check the
    component of the package any more, but can just import everything we throw
    at it. This also allows us to put some selected universe packages under
    langpack support. (LP: #788685, part 1)
  * pkgstriptranslations: Force stripping and translation tarball build if
    debian/control has "X..-Ubuntu-Use-Langpack: yes" header. Add
    corresponding test case. (LP: #788685, part 2)
  * test/run: Fix ResourceWarnings for unclosed files. Python 3, you are
    overly picky!

  * pkgstripfiles: Symlink identical documentation to depending packages. This
    was ported from cdbs' debhelper.mk, but makes more sense here because more
    packages use dh7 these days, we want to reduce the cdbs delta to Debian,
    and we want to centralize all our Ubuntu specific package mangling to one
    place to reduce confusion. This can be suppressed by setting
    $NO_DOC_PKG_MANGLE, or $CDBS_NO_DOC_SYMLINKING for backwards
    compatibility. (First part of LP #595008)
  * pkgstriptranslations: Symlink identical GNOME help files (which often
    happens for images which are just copied verbatim from C, but are not
    actually translated). In the new test case for this also check that the
    static translation tarball is correct. This provides another Ubuntu
    specific general packaging change which previously was done in cdbs'
    debhelper.mk. (LP: #595008)
  * pkgstripfiles: Break down into separate functions, to make the code easier
    to read and maintain.
  * test/run: Simplify code with recently introduced sed_control() helper
    method.
  * test/run: Replace obsolete assert_() and failIf() calls with assertTrue()
    and assertFalse().
  * test/run, test/pickle_argv: Port to Python 3. Change build dependency from
    python to python3.

  * Add debhelper script for handling translation operations. This makes it
    possible to have properly i18n'ed packages that don't use cdbs without

    - test/icecream: Add po/ dir with an example po/*.po, *.desktop, *.server,

  * test/icecream/debian/rules: Simplify using an override.
  * Add translations.pm: debhelper sequencer. Switch
    test/icecream/debian/rules to use --with translations instead of calling
    dh_translations directly. Point to local translations.pm in test/run

  * pkgstriptranslations: Run if we are building in an OEM PPA. If the built
    package is in Ubuntu main, strip translations from it. However, introduce
    a blacklist of OEM projects (oem_blacklist in striptranslations.conf)
    which are close or past release, to not inflict this rather intrusive
    change on them.
  * debian/control: Update Maintainer field from myself to Ubuntu Developers.
  * Add debian/source/format: 3.0 (native).
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.0.
  * Apply a consistent indentation to all source files (4 spaces, expand
    tabs).
  * dpkg-deb: Replace hardcoded paths with "which", to allow local testing.
  * Replace hardcoded "/CurrentlyBuilding" path with a $BUILDINFO variable set
    in "common", to allow local testing.
  * Add test/icecream: Test source package building two binary packages
    "vanilla" and "chocolate" with two po/mo files each.
  * Allow changing the path of "common" with $PKGBINARYMANGLER_COMMON_PATH.
  * Allow changing the configuration file directory path with
    $PKGBINARYMANGLER_CONF_DIR.
  * pkgmaintainermangler: Allow changing the path to the override file with
    $PKMAINTAINERGMANGLER_OVERRIDES.
  * Add test/run: Test suite for checking the scripts/config files in the
    local build tree in a sandbox on the "icecream" test package. Cover all
    current scenarios: main/universe/PPA/OEM/NO_PKG_MANGLE/partner/local/no
    mangler.
  * debian/rules: Run tests during build, and have a failed test suite fail
    the build. Add python and fakeroot build dependencies for this.
  * Add debian/pkgbinarymangler.lintian-overrides: We divert "dpkg-deb", no
    need to ship a manpage for it.
  * striptranslations.blacklist: Drop language-selector. (LP: #570240)
  * test/run: Add test case for updating of Installed-Size. This reproduces
    LP #451764.
  * pkgstriptranslations: Adapt Installed-Size: header in control file if we
    stripped any files. (LP: #451764)

  * Switch to dh in rules; bump debhelper build-dep to >= 7.
  * Make maintainer scripts slightly more robust.
  * common: skip tests on /CurrentlyBuilding if PKG_IGNORE_CURRENTLY_BUILDING

    embedded package build, such as the testsuite of pkg-create-dbgsym.

  * Added configuration option "components" which restricts the mo file
    deletion to some components only (default: main and restricted) if
    a file /CurrentlyBuilding is present (as on the buildds).
  * Remove mo file entries from md5sums files.
