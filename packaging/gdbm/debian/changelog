    http://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/mole/seedsymbols/?pkgname=libgdbm3 to
    'debian/symbols' and drop Debian version number. Keep private _gdbm
    symbols pending discussion with upstream about declaring them

    handle read(2) returning less data than we asked for.  Closes: #274417

   * debian/rules (build): pass --host to configure if cross compiling.
   * debian/rules (binary-libgdbm): invoke 'make install' with a correct
     INSTALL_ROOT instead of installing the shared libraries byhand.  We
     have to clean up afterwards (i.e. remove stuff that should be in
     libgdbm-dev, fix the permissions and strip the libraries), but doing
     so allows us to...

  * debian/copyright: update FSF address and copyright years.

    hyphen-used-as-minus warnings as noticed by lintian.

  * No 1.8 yet because a) the soname has changed, making packaging it less
    trivial, b) the upstream changes are not hugely important and c) 1.8
    appears after 5 years of upstream inactivity and has since been
    followed by another 18 months of upstream inactivity despite some
    trivial and annoying build bugs in 1.8 which must hit almost everyone
    who tries to build it from source.

  * Migration warnings are left unchanged as a result of (c) above.

Old Changelog:
TODO
* Currently:
  'Conflicts: libgdbm, perl5 (<=5.002-2), man (<=2.3.10-5)'
  The actual problem versions of perl5 and man (which were linked against
  the wrong .so version are from December 1995, and were unstable tree;
  I suspect that nobody is using them anymore. Should I remove them?
* Uses '<=' and '>=' in control files. Is this really a problem?


libgdbm1-1.7.3-11 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Fix to the upgrading scheme, as per Ian Jackson's message:
  * Include .so.major -> .so.version link after .so.version itself in .deb
    file

libgdbm1-1.7.3-10 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Changes to the upgrading scheme, as described by David Engel <david@ods.com>:
  * No more .dist install, mv-ing etc.
  * Include .so.major -> .so.version link before .so.version itself in .deb
    file

libgdbm1-1.7.3-9 - Ray Dassen <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>
* Added 'Section: base' to runtime control file, since perl uses libgdbm.
* Use fcntl locking (POSIX) instead of lockf (BSD). Noted by Neal Becker
  <neal@ctd.comsat.com>. This is just to be on the safe side. I don't
  think it makes any difference - flock(2) states "Under Linux, flock is
  implemented as a call to fcntl".
* Include extended descriptions in announcements.
* Fixed depends line in control file.
* Package revision wrapped into version field.
* Hello-style diffs.
