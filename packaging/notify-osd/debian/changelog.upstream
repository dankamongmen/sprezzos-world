2012-03-19  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@canonical.com>

	Added manual test for Ryan's patch from the last commit.

2012-03-19  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@canonical.com>

	Merged Ryan's branch after review and approval by myself. This makes notify-osd query the _GNOME_BACKGROUND_REPRESENTATIVE_COLORS property of the root-window for picking the bubbles background-color.

2012-03-09  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Get background colour using _GNOME_BACKGROUND_REPRESENTATIVE_COLORS
	
	...instead of pulling it out of Unity's GSettings.

2012-03-09  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	Use GdkRGBA instead of GdkColor for background colour
	
	GdkRGBA is more capable in terms of parsing and its API is a better
	match for how we're using it with cairo.

2012-02-08  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@canonical.com>

	Merged avg. bg-color tinting for notification-bubble background after review and approval from Seb. Fixes LP: #810325

2012-02-07  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@canonical.com>

	Update the branch to latest trunk and add a runtime-test for the Unity schema and its avg. bg-color key, thus notify-osd doesn't crash, if those aren't available

2011-07-21  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	really make sure the average-color is read at startup

2011-07-20  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	apply only 75% of the average-color to keep enough contrast to the text and icon, pick up the average upon startup... not only on wallpaper-change

	Merged pitti's branch avoiding notify-osd to wake up on every key/focus event

2012-02-02  Martin Pitt  <martin@piware.de>

	Use wnck_shutdown() if available.
	
	dnd_has_one_fullscreen_window() initializes libwnck, which causes notify-osd to
	unnecessarily wake up on each focus change and keyboard event, even if there
	are no notification bubbles for a long time.
	
	To fix this, check if libwnck has the new wnck_shutdown() function and use it
	if available.

	Merged my gsettings-port branch to notify-osd trunk after review and
	approval from Grodon. This migrates notify-osd from GConf to GSettings.
	It covers the pure API-change as well as the migration of the schema,
	thus no packaging-tricks will be needed to move things over.
	
	Because with the introduction of GNOME 3 and moving away from GConf a lot
	of NotifyOSD's dynamic nature to adapt to settings-changes of the user
	had to be dropped, which on the plus-side allowed to get rid of some
	less-frequent executed code-paths.
	
	NotifyOSD's keys in the GSettings-schema are monitored as is the
	system-wide key for the font. But the DPI key from GtkSettings can't be
	monitored.

2011-07-14  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	No need for any gconf in the autotools configure.in and src/Makefile.am since we live on GSettings now

2011-07-13  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	Ported NotifyOSD over from GConf to GSettings... with this a lot of code and some functionality of NotifyOSD's dynamic nature - to adapt to user-chagnes on the fly - had to be removed

2011-07-13  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	Migrated gconf-based settings to GSettings-XML and added the needed autofoo-magic

2011-07-08  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

2011-07-08  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	Merged pitti's link-gcc-4.5 branch to trunk thus fixing linker errors,
	which happen under natty, because gcc is more strict now using --as-needed.
	Thanks for the patch Martin!

2011-01-03  Martin Pitt  <martin@piware.de>

	Fix linking with --as-needed
	
	gcc 4.5 with --as-needed has a stricter linking behaviour which requires
	explicit linking with all necessary libraries. Some programs use direct libX11
	or libpixman functions, and thus need to link to them explicitly.
	
	Also actually define X_LIBS in configure.in.

2010-04-01  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	Fix the masking out of the bubble on mouse-over for the non-composited
	desktop. Use gtk_widget_hide() and gtk_widget_show() for this case.
	Initially the plan was to use an animated shape-mask for the
	non-composited case, but that has not been designed yet. So we'll stick
	to this simple binary on/off solution. Fixing LP: #546650

2010-03-31  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	Made the creation of the empty input-mask for the click-through feature
	much tighter. Less is more :)

2010-03-30  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	Change the way the "empty" 1x1 pixel large input-mask is created. This is
	needed to fix a regression introduced by gtk+ 2.20.0 in Lucid. Without it
	the click-through capability of notify-osd does not work anymore. This
	fixes LP: #546650.

	Switched back to default slot-allocation scheme "fixed"

2009-09-10  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	Added slot-allocation scheme. Can be either fixed or dynamic. Fixed means
	async. bubbles are always in the top-slot and sync. bubbles are always in
	the button slot. Dynamic means the bubble can go in any of the two slots

2009-09-08  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	Merged two-slots branch to trunk, sticking with term GRAVITY (used to be
	called PLACEMENT). GRAVITY is now a setting stored in class Defaults. It
	used to be living in class Stack, but didn't really belong there. This
	fixes LP: #371422

2009-09-03  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	added passing bubble-height to stack_slot_get_position() API, some warning-printout tweaks, more two-slots adaptation, free allocated slot in class Stack on a bubbles close-handler, adjusted default gravity to be NorthEast/top-right (old position)

2009-08-31  Mirco Müller  <mirco.mueller@ubuntu.com>

	pushing for push-sake again *sigh*, not working yet, renamed PLACEMENT to GRAVITY, moved it from Stack to Defaults, adding gconf-key for it, adding gconf-watcher, reverting back to NorthEast/TopRight as default, moved unit-test for gravity from Stack to Defaults
