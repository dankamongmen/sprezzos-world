Important:
	* qualify /usr/lib/sm.bin/sendmail with version number for coexistance
> react=rvrs_name, ret=0, name=broadcast.localhost.
FAIL: t-smar-3.sh
* compile with tls, posix thread, pmilter
	* Parse_mc.pm: scan include() and add as dependancies
	* Complete RunAsUser setup for MTA
	* udpate_mc: update stats file and RunAsUser accordingly
Misc:
	* MSP/MTA split related
		- -Am -bs failure if not root (can't write to /var/spool/mqueue)
			would have to make queue dir 0660
			* Don't do that ;-)
		- queue cleaning for MSP -- do queue cleaning by subdirs
	* 8.12 related ?
		- recheck milter (Beta9+, its no longer _FFR_)
			- debian/examples/milter needs looking at
	* Debian stuff
		- removing /etc/cron.d/sendmail to stop gid mismatch errors doesn't
		  work because cron may not see the update before scheduling...
		  shipping binary suid may solve this (and removes a small window
		  where calls to sendmail binary fail)
		- rules.in: why doesn't a failure in lower make propogate up?
		- update debian/patches/patches.index
		- create an LDAP migration script
		- cleanup/extend sendmailconfig (debconf)
			- support submit.mc updates (nullclient, etc)
			- put stuff in sendmail.mc appropriately
			  above/below MAILER_DEFINITIONS
		- sendmail -> mgetty/fax linkage
		- sensible-mda: make sure mbox exists, setgid mail, drop suid

IRC comments:
* <wichert>	cowboy: I use a LUSER_RELAY here, which sends everything to another machine. That other machine uses a different maildomain, so I would like the luserrelay to rewrite the from-address when relaying
<cowboy>	wichert: does  genericstable work with the relay?
<wichert>	cowboy: that probably, but that will rewrite _all_ outgoing mail
<cowboy>	wichert:   so you want it rewritten *only* when going through the relay?
<wichert>	cowboy: indeed. And only for the receiving persons
<cowboy>	wichert: hrm... I guess a new mailer def for the relay eh?
<wichert>	cowboy: probably, FEATUER(luser_relay,host,rewrite_to) or so, with the 3rd param being optional
<cowboy>	wichert: hrm... so you using aliases now?
<wichert>	cowboy: no, people who do a group-reply to something I sent just get errors now
<cowboy>	wichert: interesting...  have you considered masquerading as your luser_relay, and then using generictable/user db to override for the uids that actually exist?
<wichert>	cowboy: sounds like a hack and certainly does not scale very well
<cowboy>	wichert: most definetly true ;-{

* <wichert>	cowboy: another thing: you might want to make a /usr/doc/sendmail/README.spam or so with info about all spam/relay-control hacks/features that are in the Debian package, with a couple of examples
