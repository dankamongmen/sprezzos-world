Description: Common files for SELinux policy management libraries
 This package provides the common files used by the shared libraries
 for SELinux policy management.
 .
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a
 number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to
 add mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.

Description: SELinux policy management library
 This package provides the shared libraries for SELinux policy management.
 It uses libsepol for binary policy manipulation and libselinux for
 interacting with the SELinux system.  It also exec's helper programs
 for loading policy and for checking whether the file_contexts
 configuration is valid (load_policy and setfiles from
 policycoreutils) presently, although this may change at least for the
 bootstrapping case
