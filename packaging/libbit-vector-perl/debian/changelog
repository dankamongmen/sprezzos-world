libbit-vector-perl (6.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * libcarp-clan-perl has been accepted as new package so the
    modules moved to this package. 

 -- Christian Hammers <ch@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Oct 2004 00:10:32 +0200

libbit-vector-perl (6.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upstream decided to split apart the Carp/Clan.pm module.
    A new Debian package called libcarp-clan-perl has already been
    uploaded but as it always takes some time for new packges to get
    accepted I include the module in this package (just as it was back
    in version 6.3). 
    This prevents some packages from beeing uninstallable due to transitive
    dependencies over this package to the uninstallable libcarp-clan-perl.
    Closes: #276540
