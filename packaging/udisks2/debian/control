Package: udisks2
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, udev, dbus
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Recommends: policykit-1, dosfstools, ntfs-3g, eject
Suggests: xfsprogs, reiserfsprogs, exfat-utils, btrfs-tools, mdadm, cryptsetup-bin
Description: D-BUS service to access and manipulate storage devices
 The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices,
 implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,
 unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks
 or USB thumb drives.
 .
 This package also provides the udisksctl utility, which can be used to
 trigger these operations from the command line (if permitted by
 PolicyKit).
 .
 Creating or modifying file systems such as XFS, RAID, or LUKS encryption
 requires that the corresponding mkfs.* and admin tools are installed, such as
 dosfstools for VFAT, xfsprogs for XFS, or cryptsetup for LUKS.

Package: udisks2-doc
Architecture: all
Section: doc
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: devhelp
Description: udisks2 documentation
 The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices,
 implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,
 unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks
 or USB thumb drives.
 .
 This package provides the API reference and manuals in devhelp format.

Description: GObject based library to access udisks2
 The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices,
 implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,
 unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks
 or USB thumb drives.
 .
 This provides a convenience library for communicating with udisks2 from
 GObject based programs.

Description: GObject based library to access udisks2 - development files
 The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices,
 implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,
 unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks
 or USB thumb drives.
 .
 This package contains files that are needed to build applications using
 libudisks.

Package: gir1.2-udisks-2.0
Section: introspection
Architecture: any
Depends: libudisks2-0 (= ${binary:Version}),
 ${gir:Depends},
 ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: GObject based library to access udisks2 - introspection data
 The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices,
 implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,
 unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks
 or USB thumb drives.
 .
 This package provides introspection data for libudisks. It can be used
 by packages using the GIRepository format to generate dynamic bindings.
