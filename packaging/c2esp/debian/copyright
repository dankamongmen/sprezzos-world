Comment: 
 It is possible that certain products which can be built using this
 software module might form inventions protected by patent rights in
 some countries (e.g., by patents about arithmetic coding algorithms
 owned by IBM and AT&T in the USA). Provision of this software by the
 author does NOT include any licences for any patents. In those
 countries where a patent licence is required for certain applications
 of this software module, you will have to obtain such a licence
 yourself.
