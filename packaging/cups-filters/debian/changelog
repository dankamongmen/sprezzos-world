cups-filters (1.0.18-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * Add patch to avoid trimming the results of FcFontSort(), as this may
    miss some reasonable candidates under certain circumstances. BTW,
    fix passing a non-pointer as a pointer to "result". (Closes: #670055)

cups-filters (1.0.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftops: Allow selection whether Ghostscript or Poppler is used
       at runtime, setting the "pdftops-renderer" option to "gs" or
       "pdftops". This way one can switch to Poppler per-queue if there
       are incompatibilities with certain PostScript printers.
     - pdftops: Allow setting an upper limit for the image rendering
       resolution, also at runtime, setting the option
       "pdftops-max-image-resolution-default" to the desired limit in dpi.
       "0" means no limit. Default limit is 1440 dpi. This prevents slow
       processing by the printer if very high resolutions are used or
       if the printing resolution is mis-detected by the pdftops filter.
     - pdftops: Fixed crash by wrong usage of sizeof() function when adding
       "Collate" to the fifth command line argument for the "pstops" CUPS
       filter call (LP: #982675).
     - pdftops: Removed newline from copies value when reading it from
       the "%%PDFTOPDFNumCopies" entry of the incoming PDF file.
     - pdftops: Silenced compiler warning about ignoring the return
       value of the write() function.
     - pdftops: Added a crash guard.
     - pdftops: Start determining the printing resolution with
       cupsRasterInterpretPPD(), this is the most reliable as often
       the choice names of the "Resolution" option are marketing names
       with higher numerical values than the actual resolution. Also
       ignore error exit values of cupsRasterInterpretPPD() as the
       function can error out after having found the resolution.
     - pdftops: If printing resolution is determined by
       cupsRasterInterpretPPD() do not stick on 100 dpi if the
       resolution cannot be determined (LP: #984082).
     - pdftopdf: Fixed segmentation fault when printing selected pages
       ("page-ranges" option, LP: #980673).

cups-filters (1.0.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop libtiff5-dev, just use libtiff-dev, this fixes the FTBFS due to
    incompatibility with cups.

 -- Didier Raboud <odyx@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Apr 2012 10:35:41 +0200

cups-filters (1.0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - pdftopdf: Fixed segmentation faults when using N-up with certain PDF
       files (LP: #980673) and when calling pdftopdf manually without
       specifyting a PPD file.
     - pdftops: Suppress image compression only for Brother printers as they
       really need this measure to print at all. This accelerates printer-
       internal job processing on most other printers (tested on HP and
       Kyocera). Also suppress page compression on Kyocera printers, this
       works around a bug in Kyocera's PostScript interpreters which makes
       printing pages with images very slow (LP: #977912).
     - pdftops: Determine printing resolution from the PPD file and supply
       it on the Ghostscript or pdftops (Poppler) command line, so that
       the renderer does the image rendering with a resolution matching the
       printer's resolution. This avoids too slow processing of the jobs
       by the printer's built-in PostScript interpreter. In addition
       a default resolution of 300 dpi is used for PPDs without any hint
       of the printer's resolution, as most PostScript lasers use multiples
       of 300 dpi as resolution (LP: #977912).

cups-filters (1.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

cups-filters (1.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - Updated all code copied from Poppler to the current state of Poppler,
       to fix any bugs or security vulnerabilities which were in that
       Poppler code.
     - Made Poppler-based PDF filters building with various versions of
       Poppler.
     - Deactivated MIME conversion rules which are not used by the PDF-
       based printing workflow.
     - Added generic PPD for native PDF printers.
     - Cleaned up sample PPD file HP-Color_LaserJet_CM3530_MFP-PDF.ppd.
     - imagetopdf: Added support for native PDF printers.
     - imagetopdf, imagetoraster: Let image input "scale to fit"
       by default. This makes photo printing via AirPrint work,
       as the iOS devices send JPEG but do not allow setting options.
     - pdftops: Generally do not compress fonts and images, and
       also do not do CCITT compression for bitmap glyphs to make
       the PostScript output more compatible with buggy PostScript
       interpreters. The output gets 30-50% longer but will work on
       many more different printer models. Problems were also
       discovered on HP and not only on Brother (LP: #960666).

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Drop debian/patches/poppler-pre-0.18.patch and patch machinery around it.
    It's not necessary with the current upstream version any more.

cups-filters (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - cups-filters 1.0.7 release
     - pdftops: Added debug mode for investigating PostScript printer
       incompatibilities and interpreter bugs. Now sending a job with
       "lpr -o psdebug" makes the filter sending uncompressed PostScript.
     - pdftops: Additional workaround for a bug in the PostsSript interpreters
       of Brother printers, calling Ghostscript with special command line
       options (LP: #955553).
     - pdftopdf: Correct handling of PJL output and page_log messages on
       native PDF printers and on printers using a driver after pdftopdf
       (including PostScript printers).
     - texttopdf: Full fontconfig support, several bug fixes and improvements
       to make the output work on more different PDF interpreters, including
       built-in interpreters in printers.
     - Fixed cupsfilters.drv PPD generator and rastertopclx filter to make the
       supported HP DesignJet printers actually work.
     - parallel backend: Use same method as CUPS to overcome infinite loop
       on side channel errors (LP: #936647, CUPS STR #4044).
     - "make clean" and "make distclesn" work also correctly now when called
       repeatedly (Closes: #663564).

cups-filters (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
    - cups-filters 1.0.4 release
    - texttopdf: Fall back to altermative fonts via fontconfig if the
      FreeMono TrueType fonts are not installed (Closes: #495598,
      Closes: #662660).
    - bannertopdf: Fix off-by-one error in page duplication
    - bannertopdf: Put indirect references to streams into the page's
      contents
    - bannertopdf: Let byte offsets for the Xref table of the PDF output
      being determined correctly also when the output goes to stdout
      (LP: #939735).
    - bannertopdf: Output multiple copies of the test page if duplex
      and/or N-up is chosen, to let the test page appear on all possible
      positions of the sheet (LP: #939530).
    - bannertopdf: Scale test page template to fit the job's page size,
      get and display full page geometry information, draw the frame which
      marks the printable area 1pt smaller, to assure that it gets completely
      visible (LP: #921073).
  * debian/local/default-testpage.pdf: Added missing "Q" operator to the end of
    the page. This broke N-up printing with pdftopdf (LP: #939530).
  * debian/control: Added explicit build dependency on libfontconfig1-dev.
    (Closes: #661127)
  * debian/control: Changed font dependency (for texttopdf) to "ttf-freefont |
    fonts-liberation | ttf-dejavu" instead of only "ttf-freefont"
    (Closes: #495598, Closes: #662660).

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/control: Build against libpng-dev, with an alternative to the older
    libpng12-dev. (Closes: #662295)
  * debian/control: Prefer building against libtiff5-dev if available, falling  
    back to libtiff-dev.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Move from hardening-wrapper to using
    dpkg-buildflags. Bump dpkg-dev build dependency to (>= 1.16.1~) for this.
  * debian/copyright: Update Format header for official copyright format 1.0.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.
  * debian/rules: Drop LC_MESSAGES setting, leftover from cups.
  * debian/control: Bump libcupsimage2-dev build dependency to ensure to build
    against a version which does not conflict on the libtiff?-dev build
    dependency.
