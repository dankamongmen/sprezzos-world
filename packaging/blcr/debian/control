Description: Userspace tools to Checkpoint and Restart Linux processes
 BLCR (Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart) allows programs running on 
 Linux to be "checkpointed" (written entirely to a file), and then 
 later "restarted".
 .
 BLCR can checkpoint both single- and multithreaded (pthreads) 
 programs linked with the NPTL implementation of pthreads. BLCR is 
 also able to save and restore groups of related processes together 
 with the pipes that connect them.
 .
 This package contains utilities needed to launch and restart 
 unmodified processes with checkpointing support.

 Linux to be "checkpointed" (written entirely to a file), and then 
 later "restarted".

 further.
