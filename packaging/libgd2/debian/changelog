    + Add and use local autotools.mk extended to support multiple build
      flavors (instead of custom-invoked configure + make).

libgd2 (2.0.34~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream prerelease.
  * Drop all patches. Bugfixing patches are all either adopted or
    differently implemented upstream now, and the only feature patch to
    improve anti-aliasing is recommended by upstream to be avoided for
    now (will be included in later releases of GD).
  * Drop pthreads workaround. Upstream now properly handles this.
  * Avoid fallback build-dependencies on xlibs-dev, thanks to lintian.
    Avoid *-dev package dependencies too, and tighten build-dependency
    on d-shlibs to versions supporting the neat new runtime override
    feature of d-devlibdeps used for this.
  * Drop duplicate build-dependency on autotools-dev, thanks to lintian.
  * Bump up standards-version to 3.7.2.
  * Update debian/copyright and long descriptions with new upstream
    author and new upstream URLs.
  * Semi-autoupdate debian/control to have the above take effect:
      $ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=cdbs-autoupdate fakeroot debian/rules clean
  * Update debian/copyright-hints due to the relibtoolization.
  * Add new CDBS snippet vcs.mk hinting about the source environment.
  * Fix copyright-check CDBS snippet to properly ignore also
    CDBS-overridden autotools files.
  * Set urgency high, as the older pathced code is known to contain
    several bugs fixed in current upstream code. Work is ongoing about
    resolving if any of those bugs have known security issues with an
    official CVE.

libgd2 (2.0.33-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Have libgd-noxpm-dev provide libgd2-dev (a virtual package since
    woody). libgd-xpm-dev does not provide it, as the two packages does
    not provide same shlibdeps info: Both provide same ABI but not same
    package dependencies, so those requiring XPM support will want to
    explicitly (build-)depend on that variant. Closes: bug#350704,

    Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com> for reporting, and to Junichi
    Uekawa <dancer@netfort.gr.jp> for patience and helpful input).
  * Use quilt (instead of CDBS builtin patch routines).
  * Use local cdbs snippet to enable debian-control (semi-)auto-update.
  * Update local cdbs snippet buildinfo.mk:
    + Correct namespace.
  * Update local cdbs snippet copyright-check.mk:
    + Correct namespace.
    + Treat all found files as non-binary.
    + Broaden scan to also look for "(c)" by default.
    + Make egrep options configurable.
  * Semi-auto-update debian/control (nothing remarkable).
  * Semi-auto-update debian/copyright_hints (nothing remarkable).
  * Renumber and unfuzz patches, and add debian/patches/README
    documenting the new numbering scheme.
  * Add patch 1003 fixing an antialiasing segfault. Closes: bug#364024
    (thanks to Paul <elegant_dice@yahoo.com>).
  * Add patch 1004 improving antialiasing lines at image edges (thanks
    to Paul <elegant_dice@yahoo.com>).
  * Add patch 1005 to more sanely bail out on missing or wrong data, and
    include config.h also for tools and examples. This closes:
    bug#360966 (thanks to the Graphviz project were these was extracted
    from, and to Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de> reporting it).

    over -noxpm, and thus avoid surprises when upgrading from woody.

  * Rerun "libtoolize -c -f; aclocal-1.9; autoconf" with newer

    less, but at least better than before) resolve the recent X11
    package split (bugreport filed against devlibs).
  * Clean out test gif's on clean target (in addition to png's).

    several megabytes irrelevant for most web server applications (the
    most popular usage of GD).
  * Minor corrections to gdlib-config man page.

libgd2 (2.0.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: Bug# 254569 (except request for LZW
    support - I rely on the good judgement of upstream. Thanks anyway
    to Domenico Andreoli <cavok@debian.org> for the suggestion).
  * Cleaned up debian/copyright:
    + Replace info contained in changelog with note on "GNU systems".
    + Declare each topic more strictly.
    + Mention "licensing info" together with copyright.
  * Improved long descriptions:
    + General introduction to GD in all (non-transitional) packages
    + Website URL added

libgd2 (2.0.23-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild to override secret NMU (HEY!!! when did we change rules to
    not need to warn before doing an NMU?!?). Still closes: Bug#243500,
    #238890.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Thu, 22 Apr 2004 00:36:44 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Closes: Bug#243500 (thanks to Jan-Åke Larsson
    <jalar@mai.liu.se>).
  * Acknowledge NMU. Closes: Bug#238890 (thanks to Domenico Andreoli
    <cavok@debian.org>).
  * Build-depend on libxpm-dev, with only a fallback to older xlibs-dev.
  * Use (and build-depend on) dh_buildinfo.
  * Add debian/TODO to source package, with notes on noxpm branch and
    interest in switching to cdbs (bzzzt, this changelog entry should
    *not* count in the "taking over the world" statistics of cdbs ;-) ).

  * New upstream release.
  * FreeType headers are now properly handled. Closes: Bug#224789.
  * Bump up (and correct syntax of) standards-version to 3.6.1 (no
    changes needed). Closes: Bug#210415.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Thu, 25 Dec 2003 00:35:51 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Tue, 22 Jul 2003 11:54:41 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Have development packages conflict with libgd-gif1-dev. This relates
    to Bug#191039 (thanks to Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.org>).
  * This package complies with Debian Policy 3.5.10.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Fri, 16 May 2003 17:56:22 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Correct paths to shared libraries for generating -dev dependencies.
  * Switch debhelper hint from DH_COMPAT to debian/compat.
  * Claim compliance with Policy 3.5.9 (no changes needed).
  * Change section devel to libdevel.
  * Run configure using --disable-rpath (although it is still ignored).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 13 Apr 2003 22:39:43 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update doc_cleaner.pl to make html file completely weblint-clean
    (required for woody, so closes: Bug#185492).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Wed, 19 Mar 2003 23:38:54 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplify debian/rules a bit: Remove the INSTALL* definitions that
    may have stripped the binaries (not sure if it is honoured by the
    automade Makefile, but better safe than sorry).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Fri,  7 Mar 2003 01:29:49 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: Bug#170353).
  * Adapt debian/rules to the new proper configure script.
  * Drop DBS and use plain debhelper instead. Adapt build-depends.
  * Use homebrewn debian/doc_cleaner.pl to clean the html doc instead of
    a patch (more sustainable if upstream chooses to not fix the
    horrible html with next release).
  * Mention new binary annotate in libgd-tools.1 manpage and add a
    symlink.
  * Remove obsolete dh_undocumented from debian/rules.
  * Add a minimal manpage for the new helper script gdlib-config.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 16 Feb 2003 02:00:42 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Relax dependency for transitional packages of their real
    counterparts.

    versions of the package.
  * Declare compliance with Policy version 3.5.8.0 (no changed needed).
  * Remove full stop in description to please lintian.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Mon, 16 Dec 2002 01:50:10 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "Will we ever make it in time...?" release.
  * Use a local hacked d-devlibdeps (to properly handle libXpm
    dependency), and remove build-depend on d-shlibs.
  * Use html2text instead of w3m (as w3m doesn't build on all
    platforms). Thanks to Adam Conrad <adconrad@0c3.net> for pointing it
    out. Hack the html to be weblint-clean for html2text to accept it.
  * Set urgency=medium - same argument as below.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 24 Nov 2002 21:01:27 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Have libgd2-(no)xpm replace libgd2 older than 2.0.4-2 (when it
    became a transitional package, instead of a virtual on (which is
    ignored by Replaces:), and instead of the old plain package).
  * Set urgency=high, as only change is with this extra hint, and we
    really want this in testing soon - even with the current
    (unreported) bug it does more good than harm to let it in.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Thu, 21 Nov 2002 06:36:41 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Conflict with old virtual libgd2(-dev) packages (closes: Bug#16881).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Wed, 13 Nov 2002 00:16:26 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Preload libgd.so when running tests. Allows building without libgd2
    already installed, and closes: Bug#167976.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Wed,  6 Nov 2002 06:03:09 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Have -dev packages conflict on libgd-(no)xpm-dev.
  * Have only transitional packages provide and conflict libgd1g,
    libgd1-altdev and old -tools packages.
  * Change build-depends to only the virtual libz-dev and libpng12-dev
    (not their real counterparts as well).
  * Add watch file.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Wed,  6 Nov 2002 05:25:56 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use (and build-depend on) d-shlibs to make proper depends for -dev
    packages.
  * Tidy debian/ by generating debhelper files in configure target and
    remove it on clean.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Mon,  4 Nov 2002 19:00:36 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct dependencies for transitional packages.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Mon,  4 Nov 2002 17:33:31 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Provide transitional packages (a virtual package cannot satisfy a
    versioned dependency).
  * Tighten libgd2-xpm-dev to only same lib (noxpm binaries work well
    with xpm lib, but not the other way around).
  * Generate shlibs files without debhelper (to correctly do the
    above).
  * Simplify dh_shlibdeps invocation (it is really only used for
    libgd-tools anyway) and avoid using -L flag (to allow rebuild on
    woody with debhelper << 4.1.1 where the flag first appeared).
  * Enable tests (gddemo and gdtest).
  * Include test images as examples in -dev packages.
  * Remove TODO.Debian (the item - warnings possibly caused by
    signedness problems - have been dealt with upstream).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Mon,  4 Nov 2002 15:30:29 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Update gdft patch 02add_gdImageStringFTEx.
  * Update configure patch 01makefile_generic_install.
  * Make sure not to compile libgd.a with -fPIC.
  * Corrections to debian/rules to adapt to new configure.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Mon, 28 Oct 2002 02:40:39 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add unofficial function gdImageStringFTEx to not break binary
    compatibility with 2.0.1 (thanks to Nils Rennebarth
    <nils.rennebarth@packetalarm.com> for complaining and providing the
    patch.
  * Fix building without libgd2-dev already installed.
  * Fix linking libgd-tools against libgd2-noxpm (not static built).
  * Suggest noxpm in favor of xpm for packages built against noxpm.
  * Build-depend on new libpng12-0-dev and on zlib1g-dev, with fallback
    to their virtual packages.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sat, 26 Oct 2002 10:32:56 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    + Antialiased freetype text output now works properly in both
      truecolor and non-truecolor contexts!
    + By default, alpha blending is now done within the library. Also,
      by default, alpha channel is not saved with PNG images.
  * Repackage using dbs (with no patches applied for now).
  * Readme only html now, so build a text version (and build-depend on
    w3m).
  * Update debian/copyright (years added, and contact address changed).
  * Correct libgd-tools dependency on libgd2-(no)xpm.
  * Build and run tests.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Tue, 22 Oct 2002 01:46:22 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Conflict with libgd2 (and closes: #158639, #157920).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Thu, 29 Aug 2002 03:50:26 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build against libpng3 (thanks to Junichi Uekawa for cleaning up the
    mess finally!).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 18 Aug 2002 18:30:28 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install libgd-tools.1 (closes: #130499).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 11 Aug 2002 02:41:02 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct shlibs dependency on libgd2-xpm (not the virtual libgd2).
    Thanks to Chris Halls <chris.halls@gmx.de> for spotting the error,
    which closes: #155498.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Mon,  5 Aug 2002 16:58:06 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch gdft.c for truecolor antialiasing. Patch found at
    http://www.coupin.net/gd-freetype/ thanks to Michael Ganss
    <michael.ganss@oo-services.com>, and closes: #154112.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Mon, 29 Jul 2002 04:04:52 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct bug related to color resolving, thanks to Egon Eckert
    <egon@heaven.industries.cz>.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 28 Jul 2002 10:28:30 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * libgd2-xpm-dev should depend on libgd2-xpm, not libgd2.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sat, 13 Jul 2002 17:33:04 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include docs in all packages.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sat, 13 Jul 2002 17:21:20 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "No more potatoes" release.
  * Major rewrite of debian/* to use debhelper V4.
  * Remove libgd.a from libgd-tools.
  * Rename libgd2 to libgd2-xpm and use libgd2 as a virtual package.
  * Add new package libgd2-noxpm-dev and do the same rename as above
    with -dev.
  * Include all header files (some where left out) in -dev packages.
  * Tighten shlib dependency to at least this build to avoid the old
    mess...
  * Add all demos from libgd-tools as example source in -dev. Remove
    compiled demos from -tools.
  * Add debug and nostrip support to debian/rules.
  * Add contact address gd@boutell.com to debian/copyright.
  * Remove libgd-tools Conflicts on libgd2-noxpm - they should work fine
    together (none of the tools use xpm).
  * Move libgd-tools Conflicts and Replaces on older libgd-tools to
    libgd2-xpm and -noxpm to make lintian happier. Suggest -tools as
    well.
  * Include/improve comment about XPM for long descriptions.
  * Set sane access rights on whole source as part of clean target.
  * Write a manpage for the libgd-tools applications to please lintian
    (and the rest of the world). This closes: Bug#130499.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sat, 13 Jul 2002 16:20:27 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct a typo (my fault!) whith the patch. This closes: bug#142946.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Mon, 15 Apr 2002 11:22:32 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change ligd-tools priority from extra to optional.
  * Include patch from Stephen <stephen@tha.net> to handle antialiasing
    (let's hope we make it for Woody).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Wed, 10 Apr 2002 12:48:11 +0200

libgd2 (2.0.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add both xpm and non-xpm to substvars files, thanks to Joey Hess.
  * Now that we are at it: Loosen up shlibs dependencies.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Mon, 25 Mar 2002 22:46:10 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops - now _really_ loosen up libpng2-dev dependency...

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Fri, 22 Feb 2002 04:43:53 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reflect changes in (NMU of) libpng3 and only Build-conflicts: the
    badly hinted one, to loosen up libpng2 dependency to all _real_
    releases available (and possibly libpng3 if indeed it is/becomes as
    compatible as claimed!).
  * Change libgd-tools priority and libgd2-dev section to make Debian
    Installer happy.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Fri, 22 Feb 2002 02:10:37 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build a -noxpm variant.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Fri,  1 Feb 2002 02:49:59 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another workaround to the libpng{2,3} mess: build-depend on specific
    version to avoid illegal versioned build-conflict on (sometimes!)
    virtual package. This will probably cause problems on autobuilders
    as well (if they still see replacing libpng-dev with libpng2-dev as
    a downgrade), but should at least be legal.
  * Add readme.* to libgd2-dev.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 20 Jan 2002 15:08:43 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Put back conflicts/replaces on libgd-tools (<<2.0.0). They where
    needed after all (even though lintian complains).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 13 Jan 2002 16:19:51 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (thanks, Ivo :-). Updating maintainer field.
  * Strip non-libgd2 part of changelog (go read the one from libgd
    package if interested in older changes).
  * Updating copyright file (Closes: #119288).
  * Cleanup old freetype2 (FreeType1) mess.
  * Use debhelper V3, tighten Build-Dependency on debhelper accordingly
    and remove postinst to have debhelper handle ldconfig correctly.
  * Build-Conflicts: libpng-dev (>= 1.2) (stuff like libgd-perl needs to
    know wether png2 or png3 is used - let's be conservative for a
    start).
  * Remove duplicate dependencies and strange conflicts/replaces
    (probably wrongly converted from those against libgd1g in libgd) in
    debian/control.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sun, 13 Jan 2002 15:50:02 +0100

libgd2 (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
