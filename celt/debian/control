Description: Ultra low-latency codec -- development
 The CELT codec is a compression algorithm for audio. Like MP3, Vorbis, and AAC
 it is suitable for transmitting music with high quality. Unlike these formats
 CELT imposes very little delay on the signal, even less than is typical for
 speech centric formats like Speex, GSM, or G.729. These are the development
 files necessary for compiling with CELT.
 .
 The CELT codec has been merged into IETF Opus, and is now obsolete.
