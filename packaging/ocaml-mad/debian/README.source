ocaml-mad Debian source package
===============================

Patching upstream sources
-------------------------

This source package uses quilt to apply and remove its patches. Please
refer to `/usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source' for information about
how to use quilt for source packages.

The quilt series is generated from the Git repository. Have a look at
`dom-apply-patches' and `dom-save-patches' from the package dh-ocaml.
