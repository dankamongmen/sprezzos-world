ruby1.8 (1.8.7.358-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: avoid running DRB tests, since they crash and leave runaway
    processes that make buildds hang forever. With this, I expect that we
    don't need to set timeouts for the test suite at all (Closes: #674942).
  * Added patch by Steven Chamberlain to make ruby1.8-dev depend on gcc-4.6,
    since Ruby will hard code that as the compiler for building C extensions.
    Any C extension will FTBFS if gcc-4.6 is not installed (Closes: #675347).

ruby1.8 (1.8.7.358-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Guard test suit run with a explicit timeout to avoid FTBFS on kfreebsd-*
    due to a timeout after 150 minutes of inactivity (Closes: #673594). For
    now, the timeout is  1 hour, which should be enough time to run the test
    suite on other architectures, and is less than the 150 minutes tolerated
    by kfreebsd-*. Thanks to Steven Chamberlain.
  * Force compilation with gcc-4.6. This avoids segfaults when ruby1.8 is
    compiled with gcc-4.7 (See #674541).
  * debian/patches/use-ldflags.patch: patch by Simon Ruderich to make Ruby
    use any existing LDFLAGS environment variable. This should make ruby1.8 be
    properly built with hardening (Closes: #667957).
