latex2html (98.1p1-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * This fixes a critical problem with LaTeX2HTML going into an infinite
    loop, rendering the program useless for people. The change involved is
    a single line; we just close an open stream in the child of a
    fork. For some reason, having the stream open in both the parent and
    the child was the source of the problem. This is critical enough to
    break the hard freeze.

latex2html (98.1p1-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added to the extended documentation. Tried to clarify that if the
    recommended netpbm-non-free is not installed, some images shall not be
    converted. Also added that to README.debian
  * Tried to make sure that the LaTeX2HTML manual is really built correctly.
  * There was an old version of html.sty in the docs directory gumming up
    the works
  * Added a symlink from Chnages.gz to changelog.gz, satisfies lintian.
  * Added a crude hack to enable LaTeX2HTML from hanging while converting
    problems.tex in the manual (this is a major problem with the package
    that has been reported upstream). I think it is important to get this
    version with the manual in frozen despite a (pretty rare) bug.

latex2html (98.1p1-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Made configure-pstoimg write out to the /etc directory, and some
    minor cosmetic changes for readability. This is a major bug: it should
    not have been writing to /usr/lib
  * Added manual pages for configure-pstoimg and configure-latex2html
  * Added /etc/l2hpstoimg.cfg as a conffile. This is a bug: user changes
    need to be respected.
  * Upgraded to Standards Version 2.4.0.0 (no additional changes)
  * Do not generate a ps file, since the resolution of the printer is
    unknown. Leave the dvi file in so that peopel may generate the ps file
    at will. 
  * closes: Bug#20005

latex2html (98.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The beta versions were never released. This is the new upstream
    release, but there were enoufh source changes to restart a new CVS
    tree. 
  * much faster, and generates much better output.
  * This parses everything I could throw at it (a few glitches exist, but
    lots better than before).
  *  Moved to contrib cause it depends on netpbm, and generates GIF images.
  * The default image type is set to GIF. Can be changed to PNG by running
    configure-pstoimg. (needs pnmtopng to use PGN as default format).
  * closes: Bug#15663

latex2html (98.1b-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * A new (beta) version that is much faster and look quite
    promising. However, they moved icons around internally, to make png
    icons available too, and this messed up the -1 version.

  * Fixed empty section in menuentry that was causing problems with
    menu. This fixes BUG#10773.

latex2html (96.1.h-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reverted to HTML version 2.0 in the default latex2html.config file,
    sice there have been cases where setting the version 3.1 and using
    math mode lost in a big way; failing to recognize mathrm and other
    environments. 
  * Install the LaTeX styles files in the proper location in the TDS
    (namely /usr/lib/texmf/tex/latex/latex2html).
  * Added commads to postinst and postrm to run texhash if appropiate. 
  * This fixes BUG#9918.
  * This is the first version to be constructed with cvs-buildpackage, in
    fact, we are really useing the pre-release version.

latex2html (96.1.h-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Edited the documentation to reflect the fact that the cnverted files 
    will work just fine when published on a HTTP server using the standard 
    Document Root /var/www, but additional installation may be required if
    a non-standard Document Root is being used.
  * Changed HTML_VERSION in latex2html.config to 3.1 to support HTML tables
    and Font size changes by default.
  * Added symlinks to icons under /var/www so that the files converted by
    LaTeX2HTML can be viewd directly using a HTML browser, or put in a 
    directory visible from the local HTTP server and viewd through the HTTP
    server. The solution is ugly, but it works, and should fix BUG#8536
  * Changed maintaner name in control file as well
