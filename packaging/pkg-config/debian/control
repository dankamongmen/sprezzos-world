Description: manage compile and link flags for libraries
 pkg-config is a system for managing library compile and link flags that 
 works with automake and autoconf.

 Increasingly libraries ship with ".pc" files that allow querying of the
 compiler and linker flags needed to use them through the pkg-config(1)
 program.
