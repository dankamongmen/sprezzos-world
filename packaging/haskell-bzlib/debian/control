Description: Haskell bindings to the bzip2 library
 .
 This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing
 streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the bz2 C library
 so it has high performance.
 .
 It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most tasks and for the
 few cases where more control is needed it provides access to the full bzip2
 feature set. 
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled for GHC.
