aptitude (0.6.9-1~exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - See NEWS for full details.
    - Checking for errors on the command-line is much stricter,
      and many commands which would previously run will now
      exit with failure.
      (Closes: #576212, #590686, #282408, #434502)
      (LP: #919216, #585408)
    - An install run will no longer proceed if any
      package was unavailable or failed to download
      correctly, instead an error will be shown
      and exit with non-zero status (100).
      (Closes: #121313, #302784, #639789)
      (LP: #734737)
    - Some commands (search, versions, changelog, …) will exit
      with non-zero status (1, or some times 100) if there were
      no matches for the given arguments.
      (Closes: #675833, #497299)
    - Support downloading changelogs for packages on
      third-party sites by guessing the URI. (LP: #563155)
    - Properly process all -o command line options.
      (Closes: #587671)
    - Package arguments without an arch-qualifier
      will also consider foreign-arch packages, in
      order of preference.  (LP: #892074)
    - Use up-to-date changelog uri construction from apt-get
      using APT::Changelogs::Server.
    - Minor fixes to changelog downloading on the command-line.
      (Closes: #631464, #587775, #537393)
    - Do not group packages as tasks based on their name,
      rather, use their section.  (Closes: #679602)
    - Most errors are now displayed at the end of a command's
      output which makes them easier to spot when there is
      lots of output. (Closes: #430392)
  * Remove dependency on libept, now access debtags and Xapian
    directly.  (Closes: #501732, #504153, #677551)
  * Depend on libxapian instead.
  * Depend on newer version of libapt-pkg for architecture
    specification string support.
  * debian/rules:
    - Clean up extra translated files which po4a is leaving.
  * Translation updates:
    - Polish (Closes: #678153)

aptitude (0.6.8-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Fix build with g++ 4.7
    Thanks Adrian Lang for the patch (Closes: #672335)
  * New binary packages:
    - aptitude-doc-it: Italian documentation (Closes: #674664)
    - aptitude-common: data files and translations
  * debian/rules:
    - use dh (debhelper command sequencer)
  * Require libapt-pkg 0.9.3 to avoid "Method http has died
    unexpectedly" (Closes: #669322)
  * Removed preinst script, the one transition it handled is
    over ten years old.
  * New upstream release.
    - Update to tasks support: task packages, multi-arch, syntax

      Task packages (introduced with tasksel 3.0) are
      meta-packages which define the dependencies of tasks.  The
      packages themselves have always worked but the 'tasks'
      grouping policy and '?task' search term did not support
      them.  This update corrects for this.

      As a result of this change to tasksel all Debian tasks now
      function exactly like meta-packages. (Closes: #382631)

      The syntax for installing tasks from the command line has
      been updated.  It now supports specifying an arch and
      requires the same syntax as apt-utils ('^' must be the last
      part of the name).  Examples:

        # aptitude install gnome-desktop^
        # aptitude install ssh-server^:armel

      This avoids ambiguity that may arise when a task and
      package have the same name.
    - Changelog downloading is restored
      (Closes: #669569, LP: #824708)
    - Exit with non-zero status when a package run is
      aborted. (Closes: #293008)
    - Restore candidate version on undo, keep
      (Closes: #529403)
    - Adjust default widths of localized columns:
      broken_count, downloadsize (Closes: #674045)
    - Update package views after 'Cancel pending actions'
      (Closes: #595753)
    - Fix minor errors in documentation. Thanks to Beatrice Torracca
      (Closes: #674675)
    - Fix groff warning in manpage (Closes: #675085)
    - Translation updates:
      + French (Closes: #673827, LP: #642840)
      + German (Closes: #672467, #668875)
      + Simplified Chinese

aptitude (0.6.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix FTBFS in sid: include build of gtest when building gmock
   (Closes: #670403, #671439)

  * New upstream release.

    - Avoid dpkg and infinite loop in download-only mode
      (Closes: #629266, LP: #975793)

    - Check for apt_init errors in cmdline_download.cc (Closes: #670379)

    - Downloading/installing now locks /var/cache/apt/archives
      (Closes: #370381)

    - Actually use aptitude::Logging::Levels (Closes: #654344)

    - No longer use ListUpdate (from libapt-pkg) to update package lists.
      Instead, restore the previous code and update it to include the
      semantics from ListUpdate which were missing.

      ListUpdate was too coarse to suit download_update_manager properly
      even though it more-or-less worked.

    - Do not call debtags on list update.  This was a rather unsightly
      kludge is better suited as a script for APT::Update::Post-Invoke.

    - Use arch-qualified names in 'Provided by' for virtual packages
      (LP: #972847)

    - Preview screen ignores Pkg-Display-Limit

      Previously it would apply that limit if UI::Preview-Limit was not
      set.  This was causing confusion and it is more useful to have these
      as two clearly distinct settings. (LP: #381507)

    - New translations:

      + Croatian (Closes: #667934)

  * Use export to really enable build hardening, etc.

  * debian/control: remove traces of aptitude-gtk:
    - aptitude: description
    - aptitude-dbg: build-depends

 -- Daniel Hartwig <mandyke@gmail.com>  Thu, 03 May 2012 15:57:42 +0800

aptitude (0.6.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Basic multi-arch support.  See NEWS for details.

      + add search terms ?architecture and ?multiarch;
      + add grouping policy 'architecture';

      (Closes: #659079, #661744)
      (LP: #454941, #845136, #884945, #904486)

    - Apply patch from Ubuntu to fix build -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 errors.
      Thanks to Colin Watson and Michael Vogt (Closes: #497539)

    - Remove GTK+ menu entry for minesweeper. (Closes: #552522)

    - Hack to prevent debug messages dumping to the screen (Closes: #651748)

    - Fix '?action(upgrade)' and others (were finding kept
      packages instead).  Thanks to 'Rogier' for the patch (Closes: #603862)

    - List update errors are reported. (Closes: #451137)

    - List update now runs APT::Update hooks. (Closes: #476399)

    - Actually silence progress messages with '-q2'.  (Closes: #141719)

    - Fix various locking issues:

      + '[auto]clean' locks /var/cache/apt/archives;
      + 'update' locks /var/lib/apt/lists; (Closes: #653479)

    - Fix 'priority' cost level in resolver.  The values should
      have been negated but were not.  Thanks to Modestas Vainius
      for this one. (Closes: #608786)

    - Fix some help and prompt strings which wrongly included
      localized names for commands such as 'why'.  (Closes: #486615)

    - Change ordering of top-level sections to match the order
      in aptitude::Sections::Top-Sections.  The default order
      is now: main, contrib, non-free.  (Closes: #181997)

    - Improve error messages when parsing grouping policies to
      use the user-visible names, rather than the internal
      names.  (Closes: #231595)

    - Change default width of %D, %I, %o, and %Z.  Thanks to
      Michał Kułach for this one. (Closes: #599209) (LP: #741417)

    - Change default width of %V, %v to 14.  This greatly increases the
      number of versions which will display completely. (Closes: #624542)

    - 'versions' now groups it's results by 'package:arch' instead of
      'package'.

    - Cleared up grouping, sorting policy error messages.
      (Closes: #231595)

    - Minor correction to the user's manual. (Closes: #365485)

    - Translation updates:

      + Brazilian Portuguese (Closes: #483964)
      + Hungarian (Closes: #592468)
      + Polish (Closes: #659803)
      + Russian (Closes: #662624)

  * No longer supplying aptitude-gtk.  It can still be compiled from the
    source but this was an experimental interface that was never finished.

    Anyone interested in continuing either of the GTK+ or Qt interfaces
    should contact the mailing list:

    http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/aptitude-devel

    - Dropped Build-Depends: needed only for aptitude-gtk.

  * Enable build hardening.

  * Bump debian/compat to level 9, use dh_auto_configure.

    - Adds cross build support. (Closes: #465076)

  * Add empty build-arch, build-indep targets. (Closes: #648490)

  * Extend aptitude-doc-* packages to include a more complete description
    of the program.

  * Update README.Debian with details of Git repository.

  * Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck to disable tests.

aptitude (0.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - aptitude no longer requires log4cxx; dropped that build dependency.

      I hope this will solve some of the random crashes, particularly
      on exit, that have been reported, but since they're unreproducible
      it's hard to know.

    - aptitude should build correctly against either the current ept
      release or the upcoming release (in experimental).
      (Closes: #581009)

  * Applied upstream patches to make the tests build when GTK+ is
    disabled.

  * Weakened the build dependency on libboost-dev, since this upstream
    release no longer requires 1.42.

  * aptitude now requries gtest and google-mock for its test suite;
    added build dependencies.

  * Add the compile flag -fno-gcse on s390; current g++ miscompiles some
    of aptitude's parse code without this. (Closes: #580085)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Jun 2010 23:40:26 -0700

aptitude (0.6.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tighten the dependency on libboost-dev to reflect the fact that
    aptitude needs at least 1.42.

    This caused actual build failures, so I'm surprised I didn't get bugs
    about it.  I don't know if this will be a permanent state of affairs;
    a configure test could take care of the one thing that's a serious
    problem (a published API reversed the order of its arguments (!)).

    - Fixes for multiple compile bugs (see NEWS for details);
      Closes: #531687, #560517, #559980, #555120

  * Add ${misc:Depends} to each binary package.

  * Build-depend on elinks instead of html2text since that's what the
    upstream Makefiles use.

aptitude (0.5.9rc3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - On the command-line, package versions can be chosen by codename
      (Closes: #547707).

    - Switch back from dpkg-parsechangelog to parsechangelog; they both
      require an external dependency and parsechangelog is faster
      (Closes: #546280).

    - Don't crash if the Xapian database fails to load (Closes: #512998).

    - Recognize --no-gui in all builds, not just aptitude-gtk.
      (Closes: #546406)

    - Don't discard errors after dpkg fails (Closes: #548879, #548889).

    - Block SIGWINCH by default so nothing interferes with cwidget
      catching it. (Closes: #547212)

    - Mention build-dep in "aptitude help" (Closes: #547151).

    - Make --arch-only behave correctly (Closes: #547266).

    - Make the "hold" command in the GTK+ interface hold packages
      instead of deleting them (Closes: #549897).

    - Mention Get-Root-Command in the manual when it describes
      auto-switching-to-root. (Closes: #548657)

    - Fix the default value of Get-Root-Command in the manual so it
      matches the actual code. (Closes: #550057)

    - Translation updates:

      + Danish (Closes: #546497)
      + French
      + Portuguese

aptitude (0.5.9rc1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Use the new apt hooks to honor holds when autoresolving
      dependencies. (Closes: #177374, #205049, #374353, #376802, #406506,
      #430816, #434731, #442420, #452589)

    - Honor the configuration options APT::Get::List-Cleanup
      and APT::List-Cleanup in "aptitude update". (Closes: #448958)

    - Make "aptitude update" actually clean up the list download
      directories. (Closes: #507603)

    - The menu commands in the curses frontend to clean up the package
      cache and to delete obsolete files now support automatically becoming
      root. (Closes: #492832)

    - Make name-based searching the default again; the full-text search
      must be explicitly requested with ?term().
      (Closes: #506651, #507359, #514625, #527540, #534671, #538198)

    - Document that full-upgrade takes extra actions on the command-line.
      (Closes: #268696)

    - Document that the "standard" apt options
      Apt::AutoRemove::SuggestsImportant and
      Apt::AutoRemove::RecommendsImportant should be used instead of
      Aptitude::Keep-Suggests and Aptitude::Keep-Recommends.

    - Various crashing bugs should be fixed in this version or previous
      versions.

      (Closes: #506649, #507099, #525801, #527739, #539805)

    - Translation updates:

      + Czech (Closes: #545144)
      + French
      + Spanish

  * Compile against libraries currently in unstable again.
    (Closes: #545609)

  * Add a dependency on sensible-utils as a nicety. (Closes: #541847)

  * Downgrade the apt-xapian-index dependency to a Recommends.  I'm not
    sure that running aptitude without the Xapian index will actually work
    yet, but this will make it easy for people to test it out.
    (Closes: #516719)

  * Remove the no-longer-necessary recommendation of
    libparse-debianchangelog-perl; aptitude uses dpkg-parsechangelog now.

  * Add build dependencies on libboost-iostreams-dev and
    libboost-test-dev.

  * Change the description of aptitude-gtk to warn users that it's an
    experimental release.

  * Only install the "move the old aptitude state directory to the right
    place" stanza in the core aptitude package, rather than duplicating it
    in every preinst.

  * Make lintian stop complaining:

    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes relevant to aptitude).
    - Tighten the debhelper Build-Dep to require 5.0.0.
    - Use set -e in the preinst script.

    - Major performance improvements in the dependency solver.

    - Translation updates:

aptitude (0.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Support for guaranteed ordering of solutions produced by the
    dependency resolver. (Closes: #514820, #514930, #524221, #473296)
  
    - The dependency resolver will continue searching for a short time
      after finding a solution, in case a better solution turns up.
      (Closes: #482825)
  
    - The GTK+ interface should no longer crash while trying to find
      dependency chains. (Closes: #514714)
  
    - aptitude is now more careful about automatically canceling the
      removal of an unused package, to avoid triggering a conflict with
      other packages (for instance, packages included in a dependency
      solution). (Closes: #522881, #524667)
  
    - The curses interface no longer warns users when they purge an
      already-removed Essental package. (Closes: #513472)
  
    - The curses interface no longer computes an excessive amount of
      dependency information every time a package is highlighted.
      (Closes: #516296)
  
    - Fixed incorrect formatting in some command-line error messages.
      (Closes: #516296, #514676)
  
    - Fix really stupid column wrapping in "aptitude why".
      (Closes: #516389)

      + Spanish (Closes: #517272)
      + Swedish (Closes: #511238, #514011)
  
  * Change the reportbug script to run in the C locale, so program output
    that's inserted doesn't get translated.
  
  * Change the description of aptitude-gtk to say that it has a GUI
    interface. (Closes: #514545, #521152)
  
  * Give aptitude-gtk a versioned dependency on aptitude. (Closes: #516527)
  
  * Include .desktop file contributed by Fabit Greffrath.  I know that
    using su-to-root is not ideal, but since aptitude-gtk can't be used to
    install / remove packages unless it's run as root, this is probably a
    good interim approach.  Eventually we'll hook up the code so that the
    GTK+ frontend can do what the curses frontend does (automagically
    become root and preserve selections). (Closes: #521255)

  * New build-deps: liblog4cxx10-dev, inkscape.

aptitude (0.4.11.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  
    - Fixed a nasty resolver bug that would cause solutions to be chosen
      poorly in some cases involving self-conflicts. (Closes: #483920)

    - "aptitude search" now takes a command-line argument
      "--disable-columns" that prevents aptitude from padding or
      truncating strings to line text up into columns.  This makes
      the output much more script-friendly.  (Closes: #136874)
  
    - Fixed the formatting of literal elements in the manpage.
      (Closes: #473580)
  
    - Defaults files for locales that contain an underscore (such as pt_BR
      or zh_CN) should get installed now. (Closes: #483620)

    the only change to Policy lately that affects aptitude was the
    restructuring of the menu hierarchy, and aptitude is already
    up-to-date with that.

    - Implement support for multi-level sections, thanks to Paul Donahue
      for the patches.
  
    - Use libept to get debtags information. (Closes: #397652, #406201)
  
    - Fixed a case where aptitude would claim that packages could
      fulfill a versioned dependency through a Provides. (Closes: #464131)
  
    - Fix task handling in the case that different versions of a package
      have different task fields. (Closes: #459348)
  
    - Fix building with g++-4.3, assuming the build-deps support g++-4.3.
      (Closes: #452204, #452540)
  
    - Forcibly make the manual compile by allowing through a largely

      state of the package cache, to eliminate some cases where it
      would break or produce wrong answers. (Closes: #421395, #432411)
  
    - Eliminate some crashes that occurred when removing packages at the
      command-line while version numbers were displayed (-V).
      (Closes: #459336, #461669)
  
    - If the package lists can't be read in "aptitude update", download
      new ones instead of crashing.  (Closes: #468751)
  
    - Document some of the files that aptitude uses in a FILES section
      in the manpage (Closes: #470839)

aptitude (0.4.10-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Add a reportbug script that includes the user's $TERM in the bug.
  
  * Fix a typo in the aptitude description. (Closes: #452710)
  
  * Add VCS fields to the control file.
  
  * Build-Depend on the newest version of cwidget so we link against
    libcwidget1 instead of libcwidget0.

  * New upstream release.

    - Add an option --allow-untrusted to override trust warning.
      (Closes: #452201, #452541)
  
    - Recommended packages are now hidden if quiet mode is enabled.
      (Closes: #452202)
  
    - Fixed a segfault that would happen after updating the package lists
      or doing an install run.
        (Closes: #454695, #454700, #455349, #453362, #455865)
  
    - If StepLimit is 0, abort dependency resolution cleanly instead of
      going into an infinite loop. (Closes: #451311)
  
    - When visual mode is entered from the command-line (e.g., via
      --visual-preview), return a failing exit code if the last
      install run the user performs fails.
  
    - Return a failing exit code from "aptitude update" if any
      download fails. (Closes: #233129)
  
    - Checkboxes and radio buttons in the preferences tree will
      now toggle on both Space and Enter. (Closes: #451765)

    - Don't swap around the name, description, and long description
      of configuration options. (Closes: #449138)
  
    - Don't remove *.gmo in distclean, hopefully fixing problems
      with translations in the Debian packages.

    versions' include files); add an appropriate build-dep.

aptitude (0.4.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

    - Replaced the options "dialogs" with a list-based display that
      handles long string options more sanely.  As part of this, did work
      on string prompts; when the text being edited gets too long, the
      prompt will now expand vertically and wrap around.
      (Closes: #197976, #331200, #424708)
  
    - The online help is now a top-level view, so some of the problems
      with it should go away. (Closes: #434349)
  
    - Support for the "Breaks" field and for trigger states is now
      included.  Thanks to Michael Vogt and Ian Jackson for the patches
      and for prodding me to apply them. (Closes: #438543)
  
    - Display styles for downgraded packages are now available:
      "PkgDowngraded" and "PkgDowngradedHighlighted". (Closes: #434442)

  * Removed “*.gmo” removal from the “distclean” target in po/Makefile.in.in
    to fix package content change on double-build (Closes: #441696).
  * Moved the menu entry from the “Apps/System” section to the
    “Applications/System/Administration” one.
  * No longer ignore “make distclean” errors, per lintian.

aptitude (0.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  
  * Properly handle EINTR in the keyboard-input thread; should clear up
    the problems where aptitude becomes nonresponsive.
    (Closes: #431054, #431686, #432323)
  
  * Make sure the apt auto-mark flags get initialized on startup, so
    aptitude knows what's automatic and doesn't clear auto flags
    pointlessly. (Closes: #432017)
  
  * Don't crash on startup when something goes wrong early in the
    initialization process. (Closes: #430061)
  
  * Disable unused package removal if Delete-Unused is false.
    (Closes: #431716)
  
  * Don't garble translated descriptions in non-UTF8 locales.
    (Closes: #432911)
  
  * Eliminate another bogus warning about a supposedly locked
    cache. (Closes: #431909)

    - Basque (Closes: #432535)
    - Vietnamese (Closes: #432283)

aptitude (0.4.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable since aptitude has been binNMUed against the
    new apt, and this build (although there are still bugs) is less
    broken than that one.
  
  * Fix an out-of-bounds error in the line editor. (Closes: #429673)

  * Force aptitude to create the state file the first time it's run
    even if the user didn't install/remove anything, so it knows
    which packages are new. (Closes: #429732)
  
  * Translation updates:
  
    - Basque (Closes: #418862)
    - Galician (Closes: #429504)
    - Vietnamese (Closes: #429447)
  
  * Tidy up the Debian diff some more.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 03 Jul 2007 07:18:03 -0700

aptitude (0.4.5.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Trim the diff way down; it looks like the switch to Mercurial, or
    maybe some of the stuff I did in the past with the packaging
    repository, generated a bunch of spurious changes from upstream.
  
    There are still spurious additions of .xml DocBook files that are
    autogenerated by po4a.  These should be deleted by "make clean", but
    that needs to be fixed in the upstream code.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jun 2007 17:08:17 -0700

aptitude (0.4.5.3-1) experimental; urgency=low
  
  * Thanks to everyone who tested the last release.  Hopefully this one is
    less buggy than it was.

  * Hopefully this release fixes a nasty race condition that caused
    garbled output. (Closes: #414838, #406193)
  
  * Fixed a bug that caused aptitude to keep trying to remove a package it
    had already removed. (Closes: #429388) Or rather, made it harder to
    trigger through normal usage; there's no clean way for anyone but
    dselect to keep track of package installation states.

  * Fix build errors in the code; build-depend on apt >= 0.7.0.
    (Closes: #429348)
  
  * Set packages to manual mode when the user cancels their removal, like
    old aptitudes did.  (Closes: #429271)
  
  * Fix compile failures with g++-4.3. (Closes: #413488)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Jun 2007 21:29:25 -0700

    merge).

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jun 2007 21:34:18 -0700

aptitude (0.4.5.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  
  * This version merges in the code I wrote in 2005 to support the
    patch against apt to add removal of automatic patches.  aptitude
    should merge its list of "automatic" packages into the global apt
    list when it's run.
  
  * aptitude will now let you go ahead when there isn't anything to
    change, but some packages need to be configured. (Closes: #424709)
  
  * Translation updates:
  
    - French (Closes: #428585, #428826)
    - Portuguese (Closes: #425779)
    - Vietnamese (Closes: #426976)
  
  * Use debian/compat instead of DH_COMPAT; switch to debhelper
    compatibility level 5.

aptitude (0.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "an entire pot of spaghetti gave its life for this upload"
    upload.
  
  * Re-enable werror (it should have always been enabled, but I turned
    it off during a period of brokenness and never turned it back on).
  
  * Rebuild against apt 0.7 (Closes: #428616).  This doesn't include
    support for the auto-mark code; I need to either forward-port
    my patches from 2005 or rewrite them.
  
  * Fix a number of crashes due to inconsistencies in aptitude's
    internal dependency model. (Closes: #420358, #420381, #420407)

  * Don't crash if some code generates a percentage that isn't strictly
    between 0 and 100; instead, just try to display it as best we can.
    (Closes: #425145)

  * 'N' now repeats the last search in the opposite direction from 'n'.
    (Closes: #414020, #397880)

  * aptitude now recognizes Apt::Get::AllowUnauthenticated as a
    synonym for Aptitude::Ignore-Trust-Violations. (Closes: #411927)

  * Increase the default value of StepScore to 70.  This should make
    aptitude less likely to wander off into exponentially expanding
    search trees. (Closes: #418385)

  * Automatically enable Keep-Recommends when --without-recommends is
    passed on the command-line.  As a practical matter, this means that
    --without-recommends no longer tries to remove a bunch of packages.
    (Closes: #143532)

  * Add DPKG_NO_TSTP to the environment when doing a package-configure run
    after something failed, so "Z" backgrounding works at the conffile
    prompt. (Closes: #367052)

  * Put packages that are both "new" and "upgradable" into the "upgradable
    packages" list instead of the "new packages" list. (Closes: #419999)
  
  * Eliminate some cases where aptitude would print an incorrect
    message about being unable to acquire a lock after some other
    error occurred. (Closes: #422700)
  
  * Never display more than one "really quit?" dialog box at once.
    (Closes: #411158)
  
  * Explicitly chmod the aptitude state file to mode 0644 after writing
    it, to avoid surprising results when it gets read back in.
    (Closes: #421809, #421811)
  
  * Print an error message if the user tries to supply arguments
    to commands where this makes no sense. (Closes: #411152)
  
  * Write "[Enter]" instead of "enter" in the media-change prompt.
    (Closes: #414777)
  
  * Remove *.gmo in distclean.  It should now be possible to build
    the Debian package twice in a row. (Closes: #424102)
  
  * Improve the description of Recommends-Important,
    Keep-Recommends, and Keep-Suggests; thanks to Stefan Kangas for
    his suggestions. (Closes: #405002)
  
  * Add some missing commands to the online help. (Closes: #402360)
  
  * Fix the alignment of text in the online help. (Closes: #399048)
  
  * Translation updates:
    - Basque (Closes: #418862)
    - Catalan (Closes: #353308)

aptitude (0.4.4-5~1) experimental; urgency=low
  
    * Eliminate the crashes due to inconsistencies in the dependency
      resolver. (Closes: #420358, #420381, #420407)
    
      Also added checks for errors that occur in the dependency resolution
      thread, so the program can cleanly generate an error message instead
      of blowing up, and improved the errors generated by consistency checks
      to include more context information.
  
    * Eliminated a crash with the revdep column generator (Closes: #420405).
    
    * Add DPKG_NO_TSTP to the environment when doing a package-configure run
      after something failed, so "Z" backgrounding works at the conffile
      prompt. (Closes: #357042)
    
    * Fix how bolding is performed in the docbook templates for manpages;
      this made the manpages completely unreadable when built with a newer
      Docbook (Closes: #415468, #416232).

aptitude (0.4.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * In addition to the bugfix for ssprintf, the last release included
    a new test case to ensure that the bug did not recur.  As it turned
    out, this test case revealed that both the old and the new code
    were buggy on amd64!  vssnprintf now handles its variable argument
    list properly, using va_copy in case it has to access the list a
    second time. (Closes: #414617)

aptitude (0.4.4-3) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Recompile to get translations back on i386. (Closes: #413698)
  
  * Fix a nasty problem that could cause aptitude to want to remove
    packages installed using apt-get or dpkg. (Closes: #411123)
  
    This is triggered by the installer, so probably this update
    should get into etch if possible.

  * Fix a bug in an internal "sprintf" variant that would include random
    characters in the output string sometimes (by reading from an
    allocated but uninitialized buffer).

  * French documentation update.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Mar 2007 09:14:40 -0700

aptitude (0.4.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * l10n and documentation release targeted at etch.  The following code
    fixes are also included:

    - Use delete[] to delete several arrays instead of plain
      delete.
  
    - Update the fix for signal blockage during configure to
      work when a package install fails (in which case the
      previous release ran dpkg --configure -a with signals blocked).
  
  * Many editorial fixes to the user's manual and updates to the
    Japanese translation by Noritada Kobayashi.  There is a Japanese
    version of the manual in the source tree, but this upload does not add
    a new documentation package.
  
  * The FSF's address in the manpage license has been fixed.
  
  * Don't generate two identical author lines in the manpage.
    (Closes: #397224)

    - Make minibuffer messages disappear when a key is pressed again.

    - Remove an assertion about the timing behavior of timed mutex locks,
      which apparently behave differently in virtual machines.
      (Closes: #381481)
  
    - Document the "unhold" command-line action. (Closes: #387336)

      screen, so that it's visible underneath the search dialog.
      (Closes: #389763)
  
    - Make the progress indicator less visually distracting by eliminating
      the yellow "progress" effect (which on many system just produces a
      distracting yellow and blue flashing) (Closes: #390971).
  
    - Unblock all signals (particularly WINCH) before running dpkg, so
      that processes spawned by dpkg don't end up with weird signal masks.

      the package list was empty.

aptitude (0.2.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, closing the following Debian bugs:
    - Hopefully this version compiles on ia64. (Closes: #243932)  
  
    - aptitude no longer displays a warning about removing Essential
      packages if the removal is cancelled. (Closes: #254422)

    - All traces of Suggests-Important were removed from the program.
      The program now has enough features that there is no longer any
      good reason to use this option; its main use was to find
      suggested-but-not-installed packages, and there are better
      ways of doing that now.
      (Closes: #245410)

    - The non-hierarchical tree mode is broken and shows no signs of
      being fixed; until it is fixed, aptitude will not use it.
      This means the categorical browser actually works again.

      (Closes: #244676)
  
    - Applied a manpage patch from Sebastian Kapfer; unfortunately,
      the old manpage has been superseded by a (pretty much identical)
      new manpage generated from DocBook :-/.  (Closes: #242304)

    - Fixed the display of ORed dependencies when describing reasons
      for a package's state. (Closes: #242663)  
  
    - Improved the calculation of reasons for a package's state in the
      presence of virtual packages. (Closes: #244817)

    - "aptitude install <task-name>" installs all packages in the task.
      (Closes: #165624)
    - Added a (mostly untested) "-t" argument, which should behave in

    - Included da.po updates from Morten Bo Johansen <mojo@image.dk> and
      pt_BR.po updates from Andre Luis Lopes <andrelop@ig.com.br>.

    - Changed the Content-Type of fr.po, as requested by the translator.
      (Closes: #156616)
    - The information that's logged about the change in the total installed
      package size is human-readable.  (Closes: #154924)
    - Fixed a display bug when downloading really big packages.
      (Closes: #171903)
    - Documented the "M" and "m" keystrokes.  (Closes: #160936, #154000)
    - Deleted references to the "x" keystroke.  (Closes: #166571)

  * Wrote a logrotate script, so aptitude's log file should now be rotated
    monthly.  (Closes: #160795)
  
  * Update standards version.
  
  * debhelper 4.0.

aptitude (0.2.11.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the aptitude-wants-to-remove-dpkg bug by following pre-depends
  in the garbage collector.  This is a one-line fix. (Closes: #151701)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Jul 2002 22:36:21 -0400

aptitude (0.2.11.1-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Er, evidently katie doesn't like capitalized urgencies.  This is the
  only change in this upload.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Apr 2002 16:06:02 -0400

aptitude (0.2.11.1-1) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * New upstream release.  RM: this does not change a single line of code;
  it just updates the translations (the reason for the release; these
  translations had fallen way behind) and fixes a few minor typos
  in documentation.
    - Merged updated Polish translations from
      Michal Politowski <mpol@charybda.icm.edu.pl>.
      (Closes: #143051)
    - Merged updated Finnish translations from
      Jaakko Kangasharju <ashar@iki.fi>.
    - Included information about aptitude's CVS in the README
      (Closes: #141371)
    - Fixed the dangling reference to SEARCHING in the manpage
      (Closes: #142651)

aptitude (0.2.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Not quite a Debian bug, but IMPORTANT: I have made the "new" command
      style the default!  If you have modified your configuration this should
      not be an issue, but if you haven't and you prefer the old style, look
      in the "UI Options" menu.
    - Translations are probably all screwed up in this release; many strings
      changed.  Sorry :-(
    - The Y/n command-line prompt now is more capable: you can enter the
      full UI or modify package selections from it.  Enter '?' at it for a
      complete description.  (Closes: #136916)
    - The '+' keybinding is no longer used to reinstall packages, ever.
      Use 'L' if you really want to reinstall something. (Closes: #138122)
    - An "unhold" command is now available from the command-line.
      (Closes: #137770)
    - A tripartite joeyh bug:
      * Tasks and sections which have 'descriptions' now display them in
        the "long description area".  (some of the descriptions I've written
        for sections are a bit hokey, though)
      * The Tasks tree previously hid many packages due to a parsing bug,
        making it virtually useless.  This is now fixed.
      * The "alien" section has a description now.
        (Closes: #136684)
    - Added a %H escape for display areas.  It expands to the current
      computer's hostname.  (Closes: #137754)
    - In command-line mode, suppress the prompt on upgrades when there are
      no actions to be taken.  (Closes: #137302)
    - Fixed a bug that caused packages being reinstalled to not be listed
      in the preview screens.  (Closes: #138120)
    - Fixed (read: rewrote to dehackify) the description widget's formatting
      code.  (Closes: #137783)
    - If the user aborts an update, the cache is reloaded before returning to
      the display.  (Closes: #138070)
    - The default value of autoclean is really "false" again.
      (Closes: #138685)
    - Fixed a rather nasty segfault due to running off the end of the package
      list.  How I didn't notice this for so long, I don't know.
      (Closes: #136967)
    - Eliminated an infinite loop that occured if the user tried to scroll
      the description while it was hidden.  (Closes: #140361)
    - The "install" command-line option now checks whether you entered a valid
      package name before deciding whether to treat trailing '+'/'-'/'_'/'='
      characters as commands.  (Closes: #140933)
    - You can no longer focus an unscrollable description widget, and the
      highlight bar in the package tree is hidden when the tree loses focus.
      (Closes: #136550)
    - "aptitude --help" now documents the "download" command.
      (Closes: #138150)
    - The status messages on startup are now suppressed when using
      "aptitude search".  (Closes: #136873)
    - When the download is stalled, "stalled" is now displayed in the progress
      bar (Curses frontend only)  (Closes: #136520)
    - The command-line mode deals correctly with window resizes now.
      (Closes: #137945)
    - No longer displays an "available" version for obsolete/local packages.
      (Closes: #120872)
    - aptitude now recognizes the "--version" option.  (Closes: #141296)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Apr 2002 10:02:50 -0400

aptitude (0.2.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - You can now access many features of aptitude from the command line.
      See "aptitude help" and/or aptitude(1) and/or the README for details.
    - The "p" package state is documented (Closes: #135112)
    - Sorted out the ~r matcher status.  Some people like the old behavior,
     so it's been reinstated; you can find out what packages would be
     or have been garbage-collected via ~g now.  (Closes: #135571)
    - Fixed a minor display bug in the download summary: the total time
     always had an extra "s" appended to it.  (Closes: #135567)
    - Removed the INSTALLATION section from the manual.  On the other
     hand, the space it used is more than taken up by the documentation for
     the new command-line stuff.  I could move that elsewhere -- let me
     know what you think, Joey.  (Closes: #136478)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Mar 2002 21:29:06 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9.4-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Backported a fix from CVS for a nasty interaction when the user
  tried to follow Suggests and remove unused packages at the same time.
    This doesn't fix all the issues, but it gets rid of the most
  immediate problem.  A more complete fix may be hashed out in the future.
    (Closes: #135956)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Feb 2002 09:12:18 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
    - Fixed crashing bug on Alpha due to divide-by-zero.
      This made aptitude much less useful on alpha machines, hence the
    high urgency.
     (Closes: #122064)
    - forget-new-on-update and forget-new-on-install now actually work.
     (Closes: #134226)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Feb 2002 10:44:57 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Compiles with g++-3 again.  (Closes: #133250)
    - Really include aptitude.pl.1 (Closes: #114396)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Feb 2002 16:02:24 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - ~ahold now does the Right Thing[tm].  (Closes: #126800)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 15:53:38 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 11:43:08 -0500

aptitude (0.2.9-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * New upstream release.  Debian bug-related changes:
    - aptitude now tracks automatically installed packages, similarly
      to deborphan/debfoster.  (Closes: #122726, #102205, #114464)

    - Packages which are held, but not broken, are now visually flagged
      as being broken.  I believe this is enough of a fix for this
      particular bug.  (Closes: #120785)

      There is more to do in general, but there are other bugs filed
      about that :)

    - Log messages now include the date and time.  (Closes: #120874)

    - Re-ordered the preview screen's grouping to hopefully put more
      interesting things first and be more logical.  Feedback requested.
      (Closes: #128542)

    - Rewrote several sections of the documentation, incorporating some
      user feedback (Closes: #126492)  There may be more work to do here.

    - Mark all upgradable packages to be upgraded BEFORE resolving
      dependencies.  This fixes a somewhat complex misbehavior
      involving ORed version-specific dependencies.  (Closes: #108379)

    - Changed the symbols for collapsed/opened trees to something that I
      hope is less ambiguous.  (Closes: #120890, #102033)

    - When editing a string, the cursor now starts at the beginning
      of the line.  (Closes: #120890)

    - When reconfiguring packages, the software fails more gracefully if
      /usr/sbin/su-to-root does not exist.  (Closes: #130423)

    - Really made translated header widths work (I tested it this time! :) )
      (Closes: #114401)

    - Corrected a misspelling in the options dialog (Closes: #120887)

    - Fixed a misspelling in de.po (Closes: #123644)

    - Fixed a minor display bug when a package category was both longer
      than the width of the display, and the last item on the display.
      (Closes: #123652)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 11:24:08 -0500

aptitude (0.2.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Matcher added for packages which are not depended upon.  (bug #122726)
      Not closing the bug, as there is more to do in this area.

    - The pause after downloading is now optional.  (Closes: #120873)

    - Package data moved to /var/lib. (FHS fix -- the package *ought* to
    handle the transition properly)  (Closes: #122334)

    - Fixed description of the "comm" section to show that it's not just
    faxmodems.  (Closes: #121951)

    - The descriptions of "j" and "k" were reversed in the help text.
    (so it said that "j" moved up and "k" moved down)  This has been fixed.
    (Closes: #122061)
  
    - Updated pt_BR with patch from Andre Luis Lopes <andrelop@ig.com.br>.
    (Closes: #122251)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Dec 2001 16:51:30 -0500

aptitude (0.2.8-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rebuild to kill the stray config.cache that somehow snuck into the
  Debian diff.  (Closes: #122890)  Urgency=high to get this RC fix safely
  into woody.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Dec 2001 09:48:38 -0500

aptitude (0.2.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backported patch from Falk Hueffner to fix segfaults and crashes on
  alpha. (Closes: #114270)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Nov 2001 12:46:30 -0500

aptitude (0.2.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backported patch to improve incsearch behavior: it now
  reverts to the starting location if an invalid (or, eg, null) pattern
  is provided.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Nov 2001 11:14:46 -0500

aptitude (0.2.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Better documents what '/' does with no special search terms.
      (Closes: #120592)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Nov 2001 10:56:10 -0500

aptitude (0.2.7.999-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Doesn't crash if tasksel is missing, and Recommends tasksel.
      (Closes: #120578)
    - Correctly uses translated column widths.
      (Closes: #114401)
  * Never mind, aptitude wasn't added to base after all.  (too close to
  freeze)  Bugfixing like mad anyway; Thanksgiving vacation only happens
  once a year!

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Nov 2001 21:08:55 -0500

aptitude (0.2.7.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a silly typo which made search histories (for instance) not
  work right.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Nov 2001 15:04:13 -0500

aptitude (0.2.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - pl translation finally merged (took way too long) (Closes: #114396)
    - Reference to ~a/~A in README fixed.  (Closes: #116695)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Nov 2001 21:30:36 -0500

aptitude (0.2.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
    - Should run at a decent speed on low-memory systems again.
      (Closes: #116750)
    - "f" is mentioned in mine-help.txt (Closes: #120251)
  * Urgency high because aptitude was just added to base (woohoo!) and
  base freezes very soon (bummer) and the efficiency issue above will
  make aptitude virtually unusuable on many older systems. (bleach)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Nov 2001 20:07:59 -0500

aptitude (0.2.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Oct 2001 15:41:21 -0400

aptitude (0.2.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Supports the Task: header.  (Closes: #113567)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Oct 2001 15:06:50 -0400

aptitude (0.2.6.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - workaround for g++ on arm.  Hopefully this will make aptitude
      buildable on all archs.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Sep 2001 19:40:09 -0400

aptitude (0.2.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixed the loading of keybindings.  (Closes: #112306)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Sep 2001 08:34:35 -0400

aptitude (0.2.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Unbroke the 'level_next' and 'auto-advance' features.  (Closes: #112267)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Sep 2001 17:55:39 -0400

aptitude (0.2.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Sep 2001 19:31:31 -0400

aptitude (0.2.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Downloads work again.  (mea culpa; Closes: #111950)
    - Translations are back in the package (Closes: #111904)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Sep 2001 12:20:34 -0400

aptitude (0.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * The "deity is kaput" upload.  I was going to wait until the previous
  upload went into testing, but deity is not being fixed and not being
  fixed...which seems to be keeping the new apt and thus the new aptitude
  out of testing.  Bleah.

  * New upstream release
    - Fixed the situation with Default-Grouping being undocumented and
    overriding the preview grouping.  Closes: #110704
    - Fixed matching with ~ahold and ~areinstall.  Closes: #111466
    - It's tempting to close 104092, because the categorical browser
    has bad lynx-like bindings...but they suck and aren't consistent
    with the rest of the program.  So there.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Sep 2001 21:30:39 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5.3-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "hey, Mr. Testing Bot, please move my code soon!" upload.
  * Backported fixes from CVS:
    - Deleted some nasty debug code that didn't compile on ia64.
    (Closes: #110438)
    - Finally found and fixed the (simple and stupid) bug that was
    preventing autoclean-on-update from working properly.
     (Closes: #108565)
  * Urgency high.  Yes, this is an evil hack.  But these changes will
    not break aptitude, and I intend to upload a version containing massive
    changes as soon as this is safely in testing.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Aug 2001 10:24:28 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "A pox on deity-devel@debian.org" upload.
  * So the deity folks kindly went and bumped the soname, thus breaking all
  software compiled against previous versions.  So aptitude has to be
  recompiled.  (and I was so close to getting into testing, too.. :( )
  Closes: #109449

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Aug 2001 19:15:41 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Oops, getopt_long returns an int, not a char.  Storing it in an int
    lets the program compile on ppc.  (Closes: #107525)
    - Added a #include that's needed to compile on the Hurd.  (Closes: #107672)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Aug 2001 16:52:44 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Hopefully, the endianness issues on alpha are now fixed, although
    I suppose there's a chance they'll reach out from the grave to
    throttle me..  (Closes: #106588)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Jul 2001 20:27:43 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - The horrible, ugly, terrible, never-should-have-happened-in-a-megayear
    bug which caused most line-entries to crash has been fixed.  Mea culpa.
    (Closes: #106378)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Jul 2001 00:08:18 -0400

aptitude (0.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Multi-CD installs work.  Closes: #104236
    - When editing the grouping policy, the current policy is displayed
    as a default.  Closes: #103962
    - Replaced the welcome dialog box with a less obtrusive list of
    keybindings at the top of the screen.  Closes: #104483

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Jul 2001 09:14:54 -0400

aptitude (0.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Compiles and seems to work with g++-3.0.  Closes: #104723
  * DH_COMPAT=2, so we really build on potato/Progeny.  (I don't even know
  offhand what DH_COMPAT=3 does, but it doesn't seem to be important for this)
  Also, only build-depend on debhelper >=2.0.0.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Jul 2001 09:59:17 -0400

aptitude (0.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Media-change messages should now fit on the screen (a better
    fix is still needed)
    - The package list will retain its selection upon being resized.
    Closes: #103963
    - Fixed a crash triggered by a word in a package description
    longer than the width of the screen.  (libhtml-munger-perl was
    the culprit)  Closes: #103961
    - Mark broken dependencies using text as well as color.  Closes: #79047
    - Make the menubar visible when no screen is active, even if it's set
    to autohide.  Closes: #102918
    - Changing a package's status should advance to the next package.
    Closes: #104209
    - aptitude can now automatically become root (with the root password,
    of course) -- I believe this should address the issue of starting it
    from the Debian menu.  Closes: #71948

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jul 2001 12:15:11 -0400

aptitude (0.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Default widths are now modifiable by the translator.  Closes: #101406
  
 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Jun 2001 14:36:57 -0400

aptitude (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - CD-ROM installs should work now.  Closes: #98956
    - Really fixed signedness issues.  Closes: #101398,#101504
    - Options are autosaved now.  Closes: #102599
  
  * Maintainer address changed to @debian.org
  * Removed beta-software warnings from the package description.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jun 2001 15:24:15 -0400

aptitude (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  This is still missing a few things -- in
    particular, some translators haven't caught up yet.
  * This one goes into unstable.  Much rejoicing (I hope)
  * libsigc++-dev added to Build-Depends, since we need it now.

  * I believe that the code to prevent installation from proceeding
    while packages are broken will avoid these situations where the
    problem resolver does stuff behind the user's back.
    Closes: #87774, #96559
  * Most of the code has been rewritten.  If these old bugs and
    crashes are still around, it's pure coincidence, and I can't reproduce
    any of them.  (I suspect they weren't even present in the latest 0.0.x
    revision)
    Closes: #60156, #63358
  * I believe that all known problems with displaying dependencies have
    been addressed.  Closes: #68628
  * I'm sure that aptitude purges itself completely by now.  Closes: #66711
  * The download progress screen has been rewritten, and will now scroll
    to keep the currently downloading item in view.  Closes: #69131
  * Errors are now collected into a single big dialog box, so even if
    there are hundreds, there's no confusion about whether the program
    crashed.  (incidentally, I still can't figure out where this
    "tried to dequeue a fetching object" comes from) Closes: #71314
  * Essential: yes packages are now hard to remove (at least when you
    first select them..if they get removed by the problem resolver, you
    won't get asked, but that should be hard to do.  Closes: #86115
  * I think most of the problems with bad search patterns are finally
    fixed (knock on wood)  This one is, at least.  Closes: #95455
  * I believe that the restructuring of the UI also eliminated the
    occasional crashes when installing from an info screen.  (knock on
    wood again)  Closes: #100187
  * Fixed the signed-char problems from 0.1.9.  Closes: #101398
  * The rewritten download progress screen should report 404 errors.  At
    least, it works for me..  Closes: #102109
  * You can now ask aptitude to run an autoclean operation after updating
    the package lists (which I think is the right time to do it)
    Closes: #97653
  * Prompt-On-Exit has been fixed since 0.1.9.  Closes: #101394
  * This includes Michal Politowski's new Polish translations.
    Closes: #101403

aptitude (0.1.9-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Clobber some unnecessary files (the package build now replaces them with
  symlinks)  (Closes: #10388)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jun 2001 20:43:01 -0400

aptitude (0.1.9-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  
  * This is probably going to be the last release before 0.2.0 (the
  version numbers worked out conveniently for once); please tell me if
  you think there are bugs which need to be fixed before I release this
  for general use!

  * Make the extended description less inflammatory, and fix dumb indentation.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Mar 2001 20:28:34 -0500

aptitude (0.1.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  This will go into experimental as "aptitude";
    aptitude-beta is now an empty package depending on it.  (I was holding
    this out of experimental because apt wasn't up to handling
    experimental nicely and because it wasn't really even up to that.
    Both reasons are no longer valid.  Hence this goes into experimental)
  * Add build-depends, and don't install INSTALL.
    (was in stable, but I missed fixing it here)

aptitude (0.0.7.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Installation of a single package without affecting
   others is now (slightly hackily) supported; it can't be done in a much
   better way, unfortunately, although a few improvements will happen in the
   future.  (closes: #74824)

  * This ought to be linked with ncurses5 (closes: #69341)

 -- Daniel Burrows <Daniel_Burrows@brown.edu>  Sat, 23 Sep 2000 09:17:48 -0400

aptitude (0.0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This one will hopefully go into the Debian archives..

  * New upstream release (Closes: #61315, #64518)
   (of course, this isn't a real Debian package, and so these bugs
    might not actually get closed... I'm tempted to also finalize 60156,
    62368, 63358, and 66711, just on the grounds that the reports are using
    ancient/doogieized versions and/or failed to respond to requests for
    more info, but that wouldn't be nice now would it?)
  
  * Eliminated a lot of unneeded cruft in debian/
