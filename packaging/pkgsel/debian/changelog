  * Set LANG to C in postinst so that the bare chroot calls don't trigger
    perl warning messages for C.UTF-8 locale. (See #344159)
  * Note that this does not affect the LANG set for the main package
    installation run, which will be handled by in-target.
  * Fix progress bar title.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix di-utils build-dependency, and bump required version to 1.20 for
    in-target.
  * Capitalise db_progress subcommand names.
  * Remove trailing spaces from pkgsel.templates, which confused cdebconf.
  * Change section to debian-installer (fixes lintian warning).
