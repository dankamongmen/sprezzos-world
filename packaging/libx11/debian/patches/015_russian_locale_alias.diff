Fix russian locale.  Closes: #368655.

This aligns with the glibc definition in /usr/share/locale/locale.alias.
This only applies to Debian's glibc, see bug #62586 and glibc 2.2.5-4.

For the same glib reason, we cannot change ru and ru_RU away from ISO8859-5,
since that encoding is enshrined in /usr/share/i18n/locales/ru_RU.  Insert 
appropriate perjorative language here.

Suggestion: can the russian default be changed to UTF-8 instead of KOI8-R?  
This will make it easier for russians to fit in with the rest of the world.
