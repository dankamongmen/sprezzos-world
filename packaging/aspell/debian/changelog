aspell (0.60.7~20110707-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot 0.60.7-20110707
    - Removed 06_null_input_segfault_fix and 11_special_chars patches as
      they've been applied upstream
    - Fixes unexpected Ctrl-C quits program (Closes: #600214)
    - Partial support for recognizing the Unicode apostrophe
      (Closes: #533378)
  * Updated policy to 3.9.2, no changes necessary

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jul 2011 23:27:13 -0400

aspell (0.60.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the debian-changes-0.60.6-5 patch which was accidentally
    introduced.
  * Reverted the pkgdatadir change since it breaks filters.  The spell and
    ispell scripts will just be left in /usr/lib/aspell, which is a
    retarded place for them but, eh, it's just not worth fighting the
    aspell build system over it.  (Closes: #612051)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 05 Feb 2011 09:48:49 -0500

aspell (0.60.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

    (Closes: #576749)
  * debian/control: added Vcs fields for git repository
  * Added new patch 06_null_input_segfault_fix.diff
    (Closes: #596642)
  * debian/rules: changed pkgdatadir to /usr/share/aspell which is a more
    appropriate location for that data than /usr/lib/aspell, and leave the
    spell and ispell scripts there so that run-with-aspell works
    (Closes: #599653)
  * Added new patch 11_special_chars.diff from Ubuntu to support German
    umlauts (Closes: #591355)
  * Updated to policy version 3.9.1
    - Converted some "Conflicts:" to "Breaks:"
  * debian/watch: corrected to not match bogus .tar.gz files

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Feb 2011 12:00:55 -0500

aspell (0.60.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.4, no changes necessary

aspell (0.60.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switched to dpkg-source 3.0 (quilt) format
  * No longer use dpatch
  * Cleared the dependency_libs= lines in the .la files

  * Added a debian/watch file

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jan 2010 20:05:20 -0800

aspell (0.60.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied a patch from Christer Andersson <klamm@comhem.se> to add a
    filter for DDTP emails. (Closes: #457274)
  * Increased debhelper compat to v7
  * debian/control: added ${misc:Depends} dependencies to each binary
    package
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.2, no changes necessary
  * Restored the html documenation to aspell-doc, which at some point had
    gotten accidentally dropped.
  * Made dh_makeshlibs ignore files in usr/lib/aspell to fix the
    unused-shlib-entry-in-control-file lintian warning

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Aug 2009 13:32:26 -0400

aspell (0.60.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Removed the 03_extra_qualification_fix.dpatch,
      05_removedebug_munchlist.dpatch, and 06_add_oo-only_texi.dpatch,
      patches as they've been incorporated upstream
    - debian/patches/04_gcc43_build_fix.dpatch: updated for integrated
      fixes
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.0, no changes necessary

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Jun 2008 14:50:59 -0400

aspell (0.60.5-2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Applied NMU patch by Thomas Viehmann <tv@beamnet.de> to

    aspell-doc.copyright to fix lintian error message.

 -- Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Apr 2008 11:52:08 +0200

aspell (0.60.5-2.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Added additional gcc 4.3 build fixes (Closes: #452310)

 -- Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org>  Sun, 06 Apr 2008 13:38:31 +0200

aspell (0.60.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * patches/04_gcc43_build_fix.dpatch: new patch to fix a (possible?) GCC
    4.3 build failure (Closes: #452310)
  * patches/05_removedebug_munchlist.dpatch: new patch from Roland
    Rosenfeld to fix invalid output in munch-list (Closes: #428285)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Jan 2008 09:29:19 -0500

aspell (0.60.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Buggy '-m' option fixed (Closes: #400878)
    - Core dump with when (r)eplacing with 00 fixed (Closes: #347191)
    - Improper Tex filter handling of escaped % fixed (Closes: #347589)

  * Removed debian/patches/03_extra_qualification_fix.dpatch, incorporated
    upstream
  * debian/patches/10_autotools.dpatch: regenerated
  * debian/control: dropped the libaspell15c2 dummy package, as nothing in
    the archive depends on it any more

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Feb 2007 20:59:32 -0500

aspell (0.60.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/03_extra_qualification_fix.dpatch: new patch to fix a
    FTBFS with GCC 4.1.  Thanks to Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com> for
    the patch. (Closes: #356444)
  * Updated to standards version 3.7.2

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 13 May 2006 15:25:15 -0700

aspell (0.60.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/aspell.manpages: added manual/prezip-bin.1
  * debian/rules: removed the -D argument from the install command of
    debian/aspell.compat, since the destination directory already should
    exist anyway and having it mysteriously breaks some builds (namely
    ia64 at the moment).

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 12:26:37 -0800

aspell (0.60.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilding, which should fix segfaults due to C++ ABI changes
    (Closes: #343060)
  * Renamed debian/aspell.overrides to debian/aspell.lintian, and modified
    debian/rules to install it
  * Updated FSF address in the copyright files
  * debian/aspell.lintian: added "aspell:
    package-has-a-duplicate-relation"
  * debian/patches/02_u-deva_common_data.dpatch: new patch to add
    u-deva.cset and u-deva.cmap data files, needed by aspell-hi and
    aspell-mr
  * debian/control: have aspell replace versions of aspell-hi and
    aspell-mr that contained the u-deva files

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Jan 2006 20:57:57 -0800

aspell (0.60.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/patches/10_autotools: regenerated

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Oct 2005 23:43:21 -0700

aspell (0.60.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved the 01_autotools patch to 10_autotools
  * debian/patches/01_debctrl: wrote a patch for a Debian packaging
    control file filter (Closes: #111929)
  * debian/patches/10_autotools: reran autotools to update build system so
    that it builds the debctrl filter
  * Updated aspell.1 manual to document the new debctrl filter

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Aug 2005 23:56:49 -0700

aspell (0.60.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * manual/aspell.1: removed a stray ')' character
  * debian/control: renamed libaspell15c2 back to libaspell15, and
    replaced libaspell15c2 with a dummy package depending upon
    libaspell15.  This effectively undoes the GCC 4.0 transition.
    libaspell, like libGLU, is written in C++ but only publicly exports a
    C interface so the transition is not necessary.
    (Closes: #317873, #318187)
  * debian/control: made libaspell15 conflict with earlier versions of
    aspell-bin, since /usr/bin/aspell uses C++ linkage to libaspell and
    thus cannot be used with the libaspell15 built with GCC 4.0.
  * Don't install the spell and ispell compatibility scripts in
    /usr/lib/aspell.  Instead install them in
    /usr/share/doc/aspell/examples so that they're easier to find.
    (Closes: #273761)
  * Added support for using dpatch.
  * Created an autotools build system dpatch that contains updated gettext
    macros, which should fix build failures on some arches.
    (Closes: #316666)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jul 2005 16:13:03 -0700

aspell (0.60.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release to fully support autobuilding dictionary hashes
  * Install a /usr/share/aspell/aspell.compat file containing a
    compatibility string used by aspell-autobuildhash from
    dictionaries-common
  * debian/aspell.postinst: run aspell-autobuildhash if the binary is
    available
  * debian/control: add a dependency on dictionaries-common (>> 0.40)
  * debian/control: no longer conflict with "aspell-dictionary", but
    instead add it to the |'d list of supported virtual dictionary
    packages.  Pre-sarge, the aspell-dictionary package was used for
    dictionaries supporting aspell 0.50.x and earlier.  Post-sarge, it
    will represent dictionaries with autobuilt hash files.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Jul 2005 07:47:03 -0700

aspell (0.60.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: renamed libaspell15 to libaspell15c2 for the GCC 4.0
    ABI change transition
  * debian/control: dropped a ton of old cruft in the conflicts/replaces
    lines
  * debian/rules: pass configure flags to change pkglibdir and pkgdatadir
    from /usr/lib/aspell-0.60 to /usr/lib/aspell, which is needed to make
    dictionary auto-hash-building transitions to newer Aspell versions
    less painful.  Note that this breaks all current aspell dictionary
    packages which install into /usr/lib/aspell-0.60.
  * debian/control: conflict with aspell6-dictionary packages, depend on
    aspell6a-dictionary packages instead
  * debian/control: merged aspell-bin back into aspell, since there really
    isn't any point in distinguishing between the two, especially when
    dictionary auto-hash-building becomes the norm.  It also eliminates a
    cyclical dependency on dictionaries that depend directly on aspell.
  * Added a NEWS.Debian.gz file documenting the dictionary transition
    details.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Jul 2005 23:47:11 -0700

aspell (0.60.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixes a prompt in French transition to be o/n, not y/n
      (Closes: #310140)
    - Change of '-l' in aspell to mean '--lang' instead of '--list' as in
      0.50 now documented in upstream's README (Closes: #310911)
  * manual/aspell.1: removed documentation of "--ignore-accents" since
    it's not supported in 0.60
  * debian/control: bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.2
  * manual/aspell.1: applied patch from Jose Da Silva to fix some
    grammatical errors
  * Install manual/aspell.html/ChangeLog.html as the upstream changelog,
    since the root ChangeLog was removed

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Jun 2005 18:15:41 +0300

aspell (0.60.2+20050121-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: made aspell-bin depend on the Source-Version of
    libaspell15.  The /usr/bin/aspell binary uses some symbols that aren't
    exposed in the public aspell.h interface, so it requires a stricter
    version of the library than provides by shlibs. (Closes: #307481)
  * modules/speller/default/suggest.cpp: applied patch from upstream to
    fix the problem with ultra or fast not returing any suggestions with
    some languages
  * common/string.cpp: applied patch from upstream to fix a faulty sanity
    check in String::vprintf()
  * examples/example-c.c: applied patch from upstream with minor cleanups
    and bug fixes

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sun, 22 May 2005 12:27:34 -0700

aspell (0.60.2+20050121-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * manual/aspell.1: '-l' is a synonym for '--lang', not 'list'
    (Closes: #301026)
  * debian/control: made aspell-doc suggest aspell (>> 0.60).  This is
    basically for documentation purposes to indicate which aspell version
    to which aspell-doc applies.  Inspired by but doesn't really fix
    #301201.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Mar 2005 21:39:00 -0800

aspell (0.60.2+20050121-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release
    - Fixes the 'Unhandled Error: The method "clear" is unimplemented in
      "WritableDict"' bug (Closes: #295748, #296397)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Feb 2005 16:44:14 -0800

aspell (0.60.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on libncursesw5-dev instead of libncurses5-dev, since
    Aspell needs the wide character support to properly display UTF-8
    documents.  Pointed out by Kevin Atkinson.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Feb 2005 16:10:07 -0800

aspell (0.60.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #274514)
    - support for UTF-8 and other encodings (Closes: #131328, #170458)
    - affix compression support
    - manual converted to texinfo
    - loadable filter support
    - fixes --conf and --per-conf options (Closes: #228237)
    - fixes abort when --extra-dicts is used (Closes: #236823)
    - fixes infinite loop when trying to replace a word with the identical
      text (Closes: #261589)
  * debian/rules: converted to use cdbs
  * debian/control: added build-dep on cdbs
  * debian/control: removed Build-Depends-Indep because the manual no
    longer needs to be generated
  * Removed Debian-specific manpages, as these have now been included
    upstream.
  * debian/control: Depend on aspell-en | aspell6-dictionary, since the
    dictionary format has changed again.  Made libaspell15 conflict with
    aspell-dictionary, since dictionaries in that format are no longer
    usable.
  * Removed doc-base support since only the texinfo manuals are installed
    now.  Upstream still includes html documentation, though it's not
    installed in the install target, so it would be possible to resurrect
    if there's demand for it.
  * Eased the shlibs dependency tightness on libaspell15 by specifying a
    dependency of >= 0.60, instead of the full 0.60.x version.  Upstream
    uses proper versioning and won't change the API in 0.60.x releases, so
    this should be a safe setting.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Feb 2005 10:12:39 -0800

aspell (0.50.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Included the contents of the GFDL license in the copyright file of the
    aspell-doc package to conform with policy.  Removed the separate FDL
    document.
  * Updated the manpages with newer ones from Aspell 0.60.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Dec 2004 13:14:38 -0800

aspell (0.50.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: made libpspell-dev conflict with and replace
    libpspell4 since otherwise it may break upgrades from woody to sarge,
    apparently (Closes: #278166)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Oct 2004 09:35:02 -0700

aspell (0.50.5-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Applied a patch from upstream to fix a buffer overflow in the
    word-list-compress utility.  This is a minor security hole, so bumped
    the urgency to medium.
  * debian/rules: Don't pass a version value with "dh_makeshlibs -V".  The
    default is fine.
  * debian/rules: Don't set CC=g++ when running configure.  This was a
    hack to work around an old broken libtool and is no longer necessary.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jun 2004 15:47:48 -0700

aspell (0.50.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * libaspell15 "Replaces: aspell-bg (<= 3.0-1)" due to that package
    erroneously including /usr/share/aspell/cp* files that are the domain
    of libaspell15. (Closes: #233511)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Nov 2003 23:38:40 -0800

aspell (0.50.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from upstream to fix a bug causing Aspell to drop the
    last character in a word when saving the word to the personal
    dictionary, in some situations.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Oct 2003 18:47:04 -0700

aspell (0.50.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Complain instead of doing nothing or aborting for unimplemented
      functions in Aspell utility, especially 'aspell filter'.
      (Closes: #189759)
    - Aspell API documentation fixes (Closes: #187290)
  * Integrate upstream fixes to #185142 as well as g++ 3.3 fixes.
  * Upstream now uses newer, less broken libtool, so there's no longer a
    need to rerun the autotool chain and include it in the .diff.gz.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Oct 2003 10:11:09 -0700

aspell (0.50.3-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added tetex-extra, gs-common, and psutils to the Build-Depends-Indep
    so that the postscript documents generated actually contain something
    (Closes: #206236)
  * Bumped up standards version to 3.6.1

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Aug 2003 20:42:10 -0700

aspell (0.50.3-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Use "DESTDIR" instead of "prefix" in install target, and
    pass configure --sysconfdir=/etc.  This will properly set the conf-dir
    to /etc instead of /usr/etc.  (Closes: #194480)
  * prog/checker_string.cpp: added an #include <cassert> to fix
    a failure-to-build with g++ 3.3.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 23 May 2003 13:16:36 -0700

aspell (0.50.3-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed unnecessary dh_testroot from debian/rules clean target.
  * Bumped up standards version.
  * Changed section of -dev packages to libdevel.
  * Fixed some minor mistakes in the aspell.1 manpage.
  * Reran autotools stuff and included in diff; don't run them at build
    time nor build-depend on them.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Apr 2003 10:12:02 -0700

aspell (0.50.3-10) unstable; urgency=low

aspell (0.50.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrote the aspell.1 manpage to get in sync with upstream's user manual.
  * Corrected an erroneous example in the aspell.1 that incorrectly
    documented use of the "lang" option.  This caused confusion on how to
    use this option.  Also, noted the correct usage in README.Debian.
    (Closes: #182077)  
  * Added a copy of the FDL to reference from the aspell.1 manpage.
  * Added a debian/aspell-doc.copyright that notes the true license (FDL)
    of the aspell documentation.
  * Added libcurses5-dev as alternative to libcurses-dev in build-depends.
  * Added lintian overrides for false positives on spelling errors.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Mar 2003 01:49:10 -0800

aspell (0.50.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use debian/compat instead of DH_COMPAT=n in debian/rules.
  * Added the homepage to the description.
  * Disabled the static libraries again. According to upstream, libtool
    static C++ libraries don't work properly.
  * Added version info to shlibs.

aspell (0.50.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * libaspell15 now Conflicts/Replaces with all of the old libaspell's to
    ensure they aren't left lying around from old installations.

  * Commented out the AC_DISABLE_STATIC macro in configure.ac so that the
    static library is built, as required by Policy 11.2.

  * Install upstream's changelog.
  * Conflict with aspell-bg (<= 2.0-2.2).
  * Moved pspell-config and its manpage to libpspell-dev.  It had
    inadvertently been moved from libpspell to aspell-bin. (Closes: #178637)
  * Improved the package descriptions.  Thanks Filip Van Raemdonck
    <mechanix@debian.org> for the suggestions. (Closes: #177528)
  * Things to note that were not mentioned in changelog for the 0.33.x to
    0.50.x release:
    - The library sonames changed, so no explicit action was necessary for
      the GCC 3.2 transition.
    - libaspell15 explicitly conflicts with every old aspell-dictionary
      package.  Since the dictionary format changed, libaspell15 is unable
      to coexist with older libaspell libraries as the libraries would not
      be able to share dictionaries (and quiet breakage would occur).
