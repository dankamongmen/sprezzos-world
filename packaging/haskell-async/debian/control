Description: run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results
 This package provides a higher-level interface over
 threads, in which an (Async a) is a concurrent
 thread that will eventually deliver a value of
 type a.  The package provides ways to create
 Async computations, wait for their results, and
 cancel them.
 .
 This package contains the normal library files.

Description: run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results; profiling libs
 This package provides a higher-level interface over
 threads, in which an (Async a) is a concurrent
 thread that will eventually deliver a value of
 type a.  The package provides ways to create
 Async computations, wait for their results, and
 cancel them.
 .
 This package contains the libraries compiled with profiling enabled.
